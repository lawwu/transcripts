[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   So people need to go back and read the history of the first hundred days under FDR, the sheer
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.880]   amount of legislation that went through, his ability to bring Congress to heel and the
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.880]   Senate.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.880]   He gets all this stuff through.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.640]   But as you and I know, legislation takes a long time to put into place, right?
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.880]   We've had people starving on the streets all throughout 1933 under Hoover.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.220]   The difference was Hoover was seen as this do-nothing joke who would dine nine course
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.000]   meals in the White House and he was a filthy rich banker.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.960]   FDR comes in there and every single day has him fireside chats, he's passing legislation.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440]   But more importantly, so he tries various different programs.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.800]   Then they get ruled unconstitutional.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.920]   He tries even more.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.680]   So what does America take away from that?
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.520]   Every single time, if he gets knocked down, he comes back fighting.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140]   And that was a really part of his character that he developed after he got polio.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.080]   And it gave him the strength to persevere through personally what he could transfer
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.240]   in his calm demeanor and his feeling of fight that America really got that spirit from him
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.440]   and was able to climb itself out of the Great Depression.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.760]   He's such an inspirational figure.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.600]   I think of Johnson and of Nixon, of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR, I can give you a laundry
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.080]   list of personal problems that all those people had.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.400]   I think they had a really, really good judgment.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.360]   And I'm not sure how intrinsic their own personal character was to their exploration and thinking
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   about the world.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.440]   So JFK is actually JFK might be our best example because he had the best judgment out of anybody
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.160]   in the room as a brand new president in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.120]   And he got us out and avoided nuclear war, which he deserves eternal credit for that.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.800]   And I encourage people out there, this is a brutal text.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.160]   We were forced to read it in graduate school, The Essence of Decision by Graham Allison.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.560]   I'm so thankful we did.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.400]   It's one of the foundations of political science because it lays out theories of how government
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   works.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.760]   People really need to understand Washington.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.520]   Washington is a creature with traditions, with institutions that don't care about you.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.440]   They don't even really care about the president.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.280]   They have self-perpetuating mechanisms, which have been done a certain way.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.400]   And it usually takes a great shocking event like World War II to change really anything
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.960]   beyond the marginal.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   Every once in a while you have a figure like Teddy Roosevelt, who's actually able to take
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.840]   peacetime presidency and transform the country, but it needs an extraordinary individual to
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.520]   get something like that done.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.360]   So the question around The Essence of Decision was the theory behind the Cuban Missile Crisis
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.280]   of how Kennedy arrived at his decision.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.800]   And there are various different schools of thought, but one of the things I love about
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.280]   the book is it presents a case for all three, the organizational theory, the bureaucratic
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.720]   politics theory, and then kind of the great man theory as well.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.160]   So you and I could sit here and I could tell you a case about PT-109 and about how John
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.040]   F. Kennedy experienced World War II and how he literally swam miles with a wounded man's
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.760]   life jacket strap in his teeth with a broken back and he saved him and he ended up on the
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.180]   cover of Life magazine and he was a war hero.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.940]   And he was a deeply smart individual who wrote a book in 1939 called Why England Slept, which
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.280]   to this day is considered a text which at the moment was able to describe in detail
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.480]   why Neville Chamberlain and the British political system arrived at the policy of appeasement.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.960]   I actually have an original copy, it's one of my most prized possessions, and from 1939
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.680]   because this is a 23-year-old kid, who the fuck are you, John F. Kennedy?
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.240]   Turns out he's a brilliant man.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.560]   And another just favorite aside is that at the Potsdam Conference, where Harry Truman
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.840]   is there with Stalin and everybody, so in the room at the same time, Harry S. Truman,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.960]   president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the general, right, who will succeed
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   him.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.440]   26-year-old John F. Kennedy as a journalist and all three of those presidents were in
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.240]   the same room with Joseph Stalin and others.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.320]   And that's the story of America right there.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.680]   I'm going to give you one of the most depressing quotes, which is deeply true.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.120]   Roger Ailes, who is a genius, shout out to The Loudest Voice in the Room by Gabriel
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.480]   Sherman, that book changed my life too, because it really made me understand the media.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.440]   People don't want to be informed, they want to feel informed.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.880]   The following is a conversation with Sagar Anjeti, his second time on the podcast.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.040]   Sagar is a political commentator, journalist, co-host of Breaking Points with Crystal Ball
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.640]   and of the Realignment podcast with Marshall Kozlov.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.680]   Sagar is one of the most well-read people I've ever met.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.560]   His love of history and the wisdom gained from reading thousands of history books radiates
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.640]   through every analysis he makes of the world.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.240]   In this podcast, we trace out the history of the various ideological movements that
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   led up to the current political moment.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.440]   In doing so, we mention a large number of amazing books.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.040]   We'll put a link to them in the description for those interested to learn more about each
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.880]   topic.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.440]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.100]   And now, dear friends, here's Sagar Anjeti.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.420]   So let's start with the obvious big question, why do you think Trump won?
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.920]   Let's break it down.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.700]   Before the election, you said that if Trump wins, it's going to be because of immigration.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.000]   So aside from immigration, what are the maybe less than obvious reasons that Trump won?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.580]   Yes, we absolutely need to return to immigration.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.920]   But without that multifaceted explanation, let's start with the easiest one.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.680]   There has been a wave of anti-incumbent energy around the world.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.160]   The Financial Times chart recently went viral showing the first time I think since World
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.040]   War II, possibly since 1905, I need to look at the data set, that all anti-incumbent parties
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.260]   all across the world suffered major defeats.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.280]   So that's a very, very high level analysis.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.720]   And we can return to that if we talk about Donald Trump's victory in 2016, because there
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.240]   were similar global precursors.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.120]   That individual level in the United States, there's a very simple explanation as well,
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.560]   which is that Joe Biden was very old, he was very unpopular, inflation was high.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.060]   Inflation is one of the highest determiners of people switching their votes and putting
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.220]   their primacy on that ahead of any other issue at the ballot box.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.220]   So that's that.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.360]   But I think it's actually much deeper at a psychological level for who America is and
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   what it is.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.440]   And fundamentally, I think what we're going to spend a lot of time talking about today
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.600]   is the evolution of the modern left and its collapse in the Kamala Harris candidacy and
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.720]   eventually the loss to Donald Trump in the popular vote, where really is like an apotheosis
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.160]   of several social forces.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.480]   So we're going to talk about the great awakening or so-called awokening, which is very important
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.360]   to understanding all of this.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.660]   There's also really Donald Trump himself, who is really one of the most unique individual
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.540]   American politicians that we've seen in decades.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.300]   At this point, Donald Trump's victory makes him the most important and transformative
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.480]   figure in American politics since FDR.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.620]   And thought process for the audience is in 2028, there will be an 18-year-old who's eligible
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.620]   to vote, who cannot remember a time when Donald J. Trump was not the central American figure.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.220]   And there's stories in World War II, where troops were on the front lines, some of them
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.540]   were 18, 19 years old, FDR died, and they literally said, "Well, who's the president?"
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.540]   And they said, "Harry Truman, you dumb ass."
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.660]   And they go, "Who?"
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.220]   They couldn't conceive of a universe where FDR was not the president of the United States.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.940]   And Donald Trump, even during the Biden administration, he was the figure.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.500]   Joe Biden defined his entire candidacy and his legacy around defeating this man, and
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   obviously, he's failed.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.860]   We should talk a lot about Joe Biden as well for his own failed theories of the presidency.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.580]   So I think at a macro level, it's easy to understand.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.180]   At a basic level, inflation, it's easy to understand.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.820]   But what I really hope that a lot of people can take away is how fundamentally unique
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.700]   Donald Trump is as a political figure and what he was able to do to realign American
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   politics really forever.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.700]   I mean, in the white working class realignment originally in 2016, the activation really
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:07.440]   of a multiracial kind of working class coalition and of really splitting American lines along
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.780]   a single individual question of, did you attend a four-year college degree institution or
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.780]   not?
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:19.980]   And this is a crazy thing to say, Donald Trump is one of the most racially depolarizing electoral
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.180]   figures in American history.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:29.860]   We lived in 2016 at a time when racial groups really voted in blocks, Latinos, blacks, whites.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.660]   There was some, of course, division between the white working class and the white college
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.340]   educated, white collar workers.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.580]   But by and large, you could pretty fairly say that Asians, Indians, everyone, 80, 90%
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.780]   were going to vote for the Democratic Party, Latinos as well.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.620]   I'm born here in Texas, in the state of Texas.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.580]   George W. Bush shocked people when he won some 40% of the Latino vote.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.060]   Donald Trump just beat Kamala Harris with Latino men, and he ran up the table for young
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.060]   men.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.940]   So really, fundamentally, we have witnessed a full realignment in American politics, and
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.660]   that's a really fundamental problem for the modern left.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.580]   It's erased a lot of the conversation around gerrymandering, around the electoral college,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.700]   the so-called electoral college bias towards Republicans, really being able to win the
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.340]   popular vote for the first time since 2004 is a shocking and landmark achievement by
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.340]   a Republican.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.820]   In 2008, I have a book on my shelf, and I always look at it to remind myself how much
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.820]   things can change.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.780]   James Carville, and it says 40 more years, how Democrats will never lose an election
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.780]   again.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.340]   2008, they wrote that book after the Obama coalition and the landslide.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.700]   And something I love so much about this country, people change their minds all the time.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.220]   I was born in 1992.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.260]   I watched red states go blue, I've seen blue states go red, I've seen swing states go red
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.260]   or blue.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.580]   I've seen millions of people pick up and move.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.300]   The greatest internal migration in the United States since World War II.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.380]   And it's really inspiring because it's a really dynamic, interesting place.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.380]   And I love covering it.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.500]   I love thinking about it, talking about it, talking to people, it's awesome.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.620]   One of the reasons I'm a big fan of yours is you're a student of history.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:17.300]   And so you recommended a bunch of books to me, and they and others thread the different
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.500]   movements throughout American history.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.260]   Some movements take off and do hold power for a long time.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.300]   Some don't.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.420]   And some are started by a small number of people and are controlled by a small number
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.420]   of people.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.420]   Some are mass movements.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.980]   And it's just fascinating to watch how those movements evolve and then fit themselves maybe
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.060]   into the constraints of a two-party system.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.100]   And I'd love to sort of talk about the various perspectives of that.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:51.460]   So would it be fair to say that this election was turned into a kind of class struggle?
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.940]   Well, I won't go that far because to say it's a class struggle really implies that things
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.180]   fundamentally align on economic lines.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.300]   And I don't think that's necessarily accurate.
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.220]   Although, if that's your lens, you could get there.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.780]   So there's a very big statistic going around right now where Kamala Harris increased her
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.660]   vote share and won households over $100,000 or more.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.980]   And Donald Trump won households under $100,000.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.000]   So you could view that in an economic lens.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.140]   The problem, again, that I have is that that is much more a proxy for a four-year college
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.820]   degree and for education.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.900]   And so one of my favorite books is called Coming Apart by Charles Murray.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:36.140]   And that book really, really underscores how the cultural milieu that people swim in when
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.860]   they attend a four-year college degree and the trajectory of their life, not only on
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:45.340]   where they move to, who they marry, what type of grocery store they go to, their cultural
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.660]   role, what television shows that they watch.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.020]   One of my favorite questions from Charles Murray is called a bubble quiz.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.220]   I encourage people to go take it, by the way, which asks you a question.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.600]   It's like, what does the word Branson mean to you?
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.060]   And it has a couple of answers.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.500]   One of them is Branson is Richard Branson, Sir Richard Branson.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.580]   Number two is Branson, Missouri, which is like a country music tourist-style destination.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.140]   Three is it means nothing.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.340]   So you are less in a bubble if you say country music, and you're very much in the bubble
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.780]   if you say Richard Branson.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.980]   And I remember taking that test for the first time, I go, obviously, Sir Richard Branson,
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.980]   Virgin Atlantic.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.980]   Like, what?
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.980]   And then I was like, wait, I'm in the bubble.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.460]   And there are other things in there, like can you name various different military ranks?
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.020]   I can because I'm a history nerd, but the vast majority of college-educated people don't
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.140]   know anybody who served in the United States military.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.260]   They don't have family members who do.
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.300]   The most popular shows in America are like the Big Bang Theory and NCIS, whereas people
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.380]   in our probably cultural milieu, our favorite shows are White Lotus, The Last of Us.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.660]   This is prestige television, right, with a very small audience, but high-income, high-education.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:52.560]   So the point is that culture really defines who we are as Americans, where we live.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.900]   And rural-urban is one way to describe it, but honestly, with the work-from-home revolution
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.740]   and more rich people and highly-educated people moving to more rural, suburban areas they
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.460]   traditionally weren't able to commute in, that's changing.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.340]   And so really, the Internet is everything.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.300]   The stuff that you consume on the Internet, the stuff that you spend your time doing,
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.100]   the type of books you read, whether you read a book at all, frankly, whether you travel
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.580]   to Europe, whether you have a passport, all the things that you value in your life, that
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.780]   is the real cultural divide in America.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.220]   And I actually think that's what this revolution of Donald Trump was activating and bringing
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:32.460]   people to the polls, bringing a lot of those traditional working-class voters of all races
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:39.420]   away from the Democratic Party along the lines of elitism, of sneering, and of a general
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.300]   cultural feeling that these people don't understand me and my struggles in this life.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   - And so the trivial formulation is that it's the wokeism, the anti-wokeism movement.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.300]   - Yeah.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.060]   - So it's not necessarily that Trump winning was a statement against wokeism, it was the
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.900]   broader anti-elitism.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:04.040]   - It's difficult to say because I wouldn't dismiss anti-wokeism or wokeism as an explanation,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.460]   but we need to understand the electoral impacts of woke.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:13.700]   So there's varying degrees of how you're going to encounter "wokeism," and this is a very
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.420]   difficult thing to define.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.140]   So let me just try and break it down, which is there are the types of things that you're
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.420]   going to interact with on a cultural basis, and what I mean by that is going to watch
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.140]   a TV show and just for some reason there's two trans characters, and it's never particularly
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.100]   explained why, they just are there.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.420]   Or watching a commercial, and it's the same thing.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.740]   I don't know, I remember I was watching, I think it was Dr. Strange and the Multiverse
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.980]   of Madness, and the main, it was a terrible movie by the way, don't recommend it.
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.140]   But one of the characters, I think her name was like America, and she wore a gay pride
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.140]   flag.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.460]   Right, look, many left-wingers would make fun of me for saying these things, but that
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.100]   is obviously a social agenda to the point as in they believe it is like deeply acceptable,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:01.180]   that is used by Hollywood and cultural elites who really value those progress in sexual
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.380]   orientation and others, and really believe it's important to quote-unquote showcase it
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.380]   for representation.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.420]   So that's like one way that we may encounter quote-unquote wokeism.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.580]   But the more important ways, frankly, are the ways that affirmative action, which really
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.240]   has its roots in American society all the way going back to the 1960s, and how those
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.260]   have manifested in our economy and in our understanding of quote-unquote discrimination.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.300]   So two books I can recommend, one is called The Origins of Woke, that's by Richard Hanania.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.840]   There's another one, The Age of Entitlement, by Christopher Caldwell.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.320]   And they make a very strong case that Caldwell in particular, that he calls it like a new
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:43.080]   founding of America, was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, because it created
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.920]   an entire new legal regime and understanding of race in the American character and how
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.520]   the government was going to enforce that.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.900]   And that really ties in with another one of the books that I recommended to you about
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:16:00.100]   The Origins of Trump by Jim Webb, and Senator Jim Webb, incredible, incredible man.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:06.500]   He's so underappreciated, intellectual, he was anti-war, and people may remember him
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:12.860]   from the 2016 primary, and they asked him a question, I don't exactly remember, about
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.860]   one of his enemies.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.260]   And he's like, "Well, one of them was a guy shot in Vietnam," and he was running against
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.260]   Hillary.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.680]   And that guy, he wrote the book Born Fighting, I think it's History of the Scots-Irish People,
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.900]   something like that.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.860]   And that book really opened my eyes to the way that affirmative action and racial preferences
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:37.980]   that were playing out through the HR managerial elite really turned a lot of people within
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.060]   the white working class away from the Democratic Party and felt fundamentally discriminated
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.500]   against by the professional managerial class.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.020]   And so there's a lot of roots to this, the managerial revolution by James Burnham, and
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:58.520]   in terms of the origin of how we got here, but the crystallization of DEI and/or affirmative
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.260]   action, I prefer to use the term affirmative action, in the highest echelons of business,
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.680]   and there became this idea that representation itself was the only thing that mattered.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.740]   And I think that right around 2014, that really went on steroids, and that's why it's not
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.900]   an accident that Donald J. Trump elected in 2016.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.300]   At this point, do you think this election is a statement that wokeism as a movement
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.300]   is dead?
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   I don't know.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.480]   I mean, it's very difficult to say, because wokeism itself is not a movement with a party
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   leader.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:32.900]   It's a amorphous belief that has worked its way through institutions now for almost 40
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.900]   or 50 years.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.160]   I mean, it's effectively a religion.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.300]   And part of the reason why it's difficult to define is it means different things to
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   different people.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.380]   So, for example, there are varying degrees of how we would define "woke."
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.420]   Do I think that the Democrats will be speaking in so-called academic language?
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.700]   Yes, I do think they will.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.740]   I think that the next Democratic nominee will not do that.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:59.580]   However, Kamala Harris actually did move as much as she could away from "woke," but she
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:05.660]   basically was punished for a lot of the sins of both herself from 2019, but a general cultural
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.980]   feeling that her and the people around her do not understand me, and not only do not
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.820]   understand me, but have racial preferences or a regime or an understanding that would
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.880]   lead to a "equity mindset," you know, equal outcomes for everybody as opposed to equality
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.140]   of opportunity, which is more of a colorblind philosophy.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.480]   So I can't say.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.500]   I think it's way too early.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:34.120]   And again, you can not use the word "Latinx," but do you still believe in an effective affirmative
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.920]   action regime, you know, in terms of how you would run your Department of Justice, in terms
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.640]   of how you view the world, in terms of what you think the real dividing lines in America
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   are?
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.080]   Because I would say that's still actually kind of a "woke" mindset, and that's part
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.880]   of the reason why the term itself doesn't really mean a whole lot, and we have to get
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.920]   actually really specific about what it looks like in operations.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.100]   In operation, it means affirmative action.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.680]   It means the NASDAQ passing some law that if you want to go public or something, that
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.200]   you have to have a woman and a person of color on your board.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.200]   Like, this is a blatant and extraordinary racialism that they've enshrined in their
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.680]   bylaws.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.960]   So you can get rid of ESG, that's great, but, you know, you can get rid of DEI, I think
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.760]   that's great, but it's really about a mindset and a view of the world, and I don't think
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   that's going anywhere.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:26.880]   And you think the reason it doesn't work well in practice is because there's a big degree
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   to which it's anti-meritocracy?
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.880]   It's anti-American, really.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.200]   I mean, you know, DEI and "woke" and "affirmative action" make perfect sense in a lot of different
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   countries, okay?
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.160]   And there are a lot of countries out there that are multi-ethnic, and they're heterogeneous,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.040]   and they are run by basically quasi-dictators, and the way it works is that you pay off the
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.360]   Christians and you pay off the Muslims, and they get this guy, and they get that guy,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   and everybody kind of shakes it.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   It's very explicit.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.840]   They're like, "We have ten spots," and they go to the Christians, "We have ten spots,"
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840]   and it goes to the Hindus.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.400]   You know, I'm talking, India's a country I know pretty well, and this does kind of work
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.800]   like that on state politics level in some respect, but in America, you know, fundamentally,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.300]   we really believe that no matter where you are from, that you come here, and basically
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.760]   within a generation, especially if you migrate here legally, and you integrate, that you
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.400]   leave a lot of that stuff behind, and the story, the American dream that is ingrained
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:25.340]   in so many of us is one that really does not mesh well with any sort of racial preference
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:32.080]   regime or anything that's not meritocratic, and I mean, I will give the left-wingers some,
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.060]   you know, credit in the idea that meritocracy itself, you know, could have preference for
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.560]   people who have privileged backgrounds.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.760]   I think that's true, and so, you know, the way I would like to see it is to increase
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.480]   everybody's equality of opportunity to make sure that they all have a chance at "willing
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.320]   out the American dream," but that doesn't erase meritocracy, hard work, and many of
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.440]   the other things that we associate with the American character, with the American frontier,
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.480]   so these are two ideologies which are really at odds, like, in a lot of ways, like, wokeism,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.960]   racialism, and all this is a third-world ideology.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.520]   It's one that's very prevalent in Europe and all across Asia, but it doesn't mix well here,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.760]   and it shouldn't, and I'm really glad that America feels the same way.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.260]   Yeah, I gotta go back to Jim Webb and that book.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.800]   What a badass, fascinating book.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   Oh, my God.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   It's amazing.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.000]   "Born Fighting, How the Scots-Irish Shaped America."
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.600]   So I did not realize to the degree, first of all, how badass the Scots-Irish are, and
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.760]   to the degree, many of the things that kind of identify as American and part of the American
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.360]   spirit were defined by this relatively small group of people.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.100]   As he describes, the motto could be summarized as "Fight, Sing, Drink, and Pray."
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:48.760]   So there's the principles of fierce individualism, the principles of a deep distrust of government,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:54.920]   the elites, the authorities, bottom-up governance, over 2,000 years of a military tradition.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:01.720]   They made up 40% of the Revolutionary War Army and produced numerous military leaders,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.480]   including Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, George S. Patton, and a bunch of presidents,
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.680]   some of the more gangster presidents, Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson,
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:19.040]   Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, just the whole cultural legacy of country music.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.720]   We owe them so much, and they really don't get their due, unfortunately, for the reasons
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.600]   that I just described around racialism is because post-mass immigration from Europe,
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.520]   the term "white" kind of became blanket-applied to new Irish, to Italians, to Slovenians,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.640]   and as you and I both know, if you travel those countries, people are pretty different,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.840]   and it's not that different here in the United States.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.360]   Scott Cyrus was some of the original settlers here in America, and particularly in Appalachia,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.240]   and their contribution to the fighting spirit and their own culture and who we are as individualists
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.400]   and some of the first people to ever settle the frontier, and that frontier mindset really
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.640]   does come from them.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.680]   We owe them just as much as we do the Puritans, but they don't ever really get their due.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.560]   And the reason I recommend that book is if you read that book and you understand then
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.120]   how exactly could this group of white working-class voters forego from 2012 voting for a man named
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.600]   Barack Hussein Obama to Donald J. Trump, you really seem to—it makes perfect sense if
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.720]   you combine it with a lot of the stuff I'm talking about here, about affirmative action,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.840]   about distrust of the elites, about feeling as if institutions are not seeing through
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:32.200]   to you, and specifically also not valuing your contribution to American history, and
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.520]   in some cases actively looking down.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.840]   I'm glad you pointed out not only their role in the Revolutionary War but in the Civil
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:45.160]   War as well, and just how much of a contribution culturally really that we owe them for setting
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   the groundwork that so many of us who came later could build upon and adopt some of their
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.480]   own ideas and their culture as our own.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.320]   It's one of the things that makes America great.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   Mark Twain.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.480]   I mean, so much of the culture, so much of the American spirit, the whole idea, the whole
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.040]   shape and form and type of populism that represents our democracy.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.960]   So would you trace that fierce individualism that we think of back to them?
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   Definitely.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.800]   It's a huge part of them, about who they were, about the "screw you" attitude.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:22.200]   I mean, that book actually kind of had a renaissance back in 2016 when Hillbilly Elegy came out.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.240]   I'm sure you remember this, which—it's kind of weird to think that it's now the
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.760]   vice president-elect of the United States.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.600]   It's kind of wild, honestly, to think about.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.240]   But J.D. Vance's book, Hillbilly Elegy, I think was really important for a lot of American
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.800]   elites who were like, "How do these people support Trump?
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   Where does this shit come from?"
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.840]   They're really—I mean, if you really think back to that time, it was shocking to the
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.160]   elite character that any person in the world could ever vote for Donald Trump, and not
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.160]   just vote.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   He won the election.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160]   How does that happen?
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.600]   And that's—Hillbilly Elegy guided people in an understanding of what that's like on
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.920]   a lived, day-to-day basis.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.600]   And J.D., to his credit, talks about the Scots-Irish heritage, about Appalachia, and the legacy
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.960]   of what that culture looks like today, and how a lot of these people voted for Donald
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   Trump.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.880]   But we've got to give credit to Jim Webb, who wrote the history of these people and
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.440]   taught me and you about their original fight against the oppressors in Scotland and Ireland
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.120]   and their militant spirit, and how they were able to bring that over here.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.840]   And they got their due in Andrew Jackson and some of our other populist presidents who
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.320]   set us up on the road to Donald Trump to where we are today.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.880]   Dude, it got me pumped, excited to be an American.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   Me too.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   I love that book.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.760]   It's crazy that J.D., the same guy—because that's—Hillbilly Elegy is what I kind of
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   thought of him as.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.280]   Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you, for me, it's actually pretty surreal.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.160]   I met J.D. Vance in like 2017, in like a bar.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.160]   I didn't ever think he would be the vice president-elect of the United States.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.000]   I mean, it's kind of wild.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.440]   One of my friends went back and dug up the email that we originally sent him, just like,
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.440]   "Hey, do you want to meet up?"
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440]   And he's like, "Sure."
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   You know?
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.440]   And I was watching on television.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.720]   I mean, the first time that it really hit me, I was like, "Whoa."
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.000]   It was like name in a history book.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.880]   It's whenever he became the vice presidential nominee, I was watching on TV, and the confetti
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.500]   was falling, and he was waving with his wife, and I was like, "Wow.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   That's it.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:17.000]   You're in the history books now forever, especially now so as the literal vice president-elect
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   of the U.S."
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.800]   I mean, his own evolution is actually a fascinating story for us, too, because I think a lot of
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.040]   the time I've spent right now is kind of...
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.320]   A lot of what I'm giving right now are 2016 kind of takes about why Trump won that time.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.360]   But we should spend a lot of time on how Donald Trump won this election, and how what happened,
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.520]   some of the failures of the Biden administration, some of the payback for the Great Awokening.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.240]   But also, if you look at the evolution of J.D. Vance, this is a person who wrote "Hillbilly
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.240]   Elegy."
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.200]   And not a lot of people pay attention to this, but if you read "Hillbilly Elegy," J.D. was
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.320]   much more of a traditional conservative at that time.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.760]   He was citing a report...
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.400]   I think the famous passage is about payday loans and why they're good, or something like
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.400]   that.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.000]   I don't know his position today, but I would assume that he's probably changed that.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.480]   But the point is, is that his ideological evolution from watching somebody who really
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.680]   was more of a traditional Republican with a deep empathy for the white working class,
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.400]   and eventually become a champion and a disciple of Donald Trump, and to believe that he himself
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:25.480]   was the vehicle for accomplishing and bettering the United States, but specifically for working
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.600]   class Americans, really, of all stripes.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:35.460]   And that story is really one of the rise of the modern left as it exists as a political
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.320]   project, as an ideology.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.160]   It's also one of the Republican Party, which coalesced now with Donald Trump as a legitimate
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.240]   figure, and as the single bulwark against cultural leftism and elitism that eventually
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.080]   was normalized to the point that majority of Americans decided to vote for him in 2024.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.880]   So let's talk about 2024.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.340]   What happened with the left?
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.340]   What happened with Biden?
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.120]   What's your take on Biden?
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.040]   Biden is...
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.480]   I try to remove myself from it, and I try not to give big history takes while you're
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.160]   in the moment, but it's really hard not to say that he's one of the worst presidents
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.360]   in modern history.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.240]   And I think the reason why I'm gonna go with it is because I wanna judge him by the things
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.840]   that he set out to do.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.880]   So Joe Biden has been the same person for his entire political career.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.600]   He is a basically C student who thinks he's an A student.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.920]   The chip on his shoulder against the elites has played to his benefit in his original
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.440]   election to the United States Senate, through his entire career as a United States Senator,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.520]   where he always wanted to be the star and the center of attention, and to his 1988 presidential
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   campaign.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.200]   And one of the most fascinating things about Biden and watching him age is watching him
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.700]   become even more of what he already was.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:53.880]   And so a book recommendation, it's called What It Takes, and it was written in 1988,
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.560]   and there's actually a long chapter on Joe Biden and about the plagiarism scandal.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.600]   And one of the things that comes across is his sheer arrogance and belief in himself
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.780]   as to why he should be the center of attention.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.200]   Now the reason I'm laying all this out is the arrogance of Joe Biden, the individual
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.240]   and his character, is fundamentally the reason that his presidency went awry.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.760]   This is a person who was elected in 2020, really, because of a feeling of chaos, of
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:24.080]   Donald Trump, of we need normalcy, decides to come into the office, portrays himself
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:31.120]   as a "transitional president," slowly begins to lose a lot of his faculties, and then surrounds
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.960]   himself with sycophants, the same ones who have been around him for so long that he had
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.680]   no single input into his life to tell him that he needed to stop and he needed to drop
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   out of the race until it became truly undeniable to the vast majority of the American people.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.800]   And that's why I'm trying to keep it as like him as an individual, as a president, because
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.320]   we can separate him from some of his accomplishments and the things that happen.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.920]   Some I support, some I don't.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.520]   But generally, a lot of people are not going to look back and think about Joe Biden and
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   the CHIPS Act.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.360]   A lot of people are not going to look back and think about Joe Biden and the Build Back
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.400]   Better Bill or whatever, his Lena Kahn antitrust policy.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   They're going to look back on him, and they're going to remember high inflation.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.920]   They're going to remember somebody who fundamentally never was up to the job in the sense that
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:20.160]   — again, book recommendation, Freedom from Fear by David Kennedy is about the Roosevelt
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   years.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.780]   And one of the most important things people don't understand is the New Deal didn't really
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.960]   work in the way that a lot of people wanted it to, right?
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.800]   Like there was still high unemployment.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.040]   There was still a lot of suffering.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.160]   But you know what changed?
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.920]   They felt that they had a vigorous commander in chief who was doing everything in his power
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.360]   to attack the problems of the everyday American.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.960]   So even though things didn't even materially change, the vigor — that's a term that was
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:49.240]   often associated with John F. Kennedy at VIGA, you know, in the Massachusetts accent.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.080]   We had this young, vibrant president in 1960, and he was running around, and he wanted to
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.360]   convince us that he was working every single day tirelessly.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.480]   And we have an 80-year-old man who is simply just eating ice cream and going to the beach
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.800]   while people's grocery prices and all those things go up by 25 percent, and we don't see
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   the same vigor.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:12.520]   We don't see the same action, the bias to action, which is so important in the modern presidency.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.680]   That is fundamentally why I think the Democrats — part of the reason why the Democrats lost
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.880]   the election, and also why I think that he missed his moment in such a dramatic way.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   And he had the opportunity.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.280]   He could have done it, you know, if he wanted to, but — maybe 20 years ago.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:32.040]   But the truth is that his own narcissism, his own misplaced belief in himself, and his
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.880]   own accidental rise to the presidency ended up in his downfall.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.760]   And it's kind of amazing because, again, if we look back to his original campaign speech
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.520]   2019, "Why I'm Running for President," it was Charlottesville, and he said, "I want to
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.880]   defeat Donald Trump forever, and I want to make sure that he never gets back in the White
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   House again."
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.200]   So by his own metric, he did fail.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.400]   That was his — it was the only thing he wanted to do.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   And he failed on it.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   He failed for him.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   You said a lot of interesting stuff.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.680]   So one, FDR.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   That's really interesting.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.680]   It's not about the specific policy.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.880]   It's about, like, fighting for the people and doing that with charisma and just uniting
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.040]   the entire country for a particular — this is the same with Bernie.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.280]   Like, maybe there's a lot of people that disagree with Bernie that still support him because,
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   like, we just want —
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   He feels authentic.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.280]   That's it.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.560]   We just want somebody to fight authentically for us.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.560]   Yes.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.560]   FDR.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.560]   People really need — FDR was like a king.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.360]   He was like Jesus Christ, okay, in the U.S.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.900]   And some of it was because of what he did, but it was just the fight.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.640]   So people need to go back and read the history of the first hundred days under FDR, the sheer
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.720]   amount of legislation that went through, his ability to bring Congress to heel and the
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   Senate.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   He gets all this stuff through.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.440]   But as you and I know, legislation takes a long time to put into place, right?
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:48.080]   We've had people starving on the streets all throughout 1933 under Hoover.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.440]   The difference was Hoover was seen as this do-nothing joke who would dine nine-course
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.360]   meals in the White House, and he was a filthy rich banker.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:02.160]   FDR comes in there, and every single day has him fireside chats, he's passing legislation.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.640]   But more importantly — so he tries various different programs.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.000]   Then they get ruled unconstitutional.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.100]   He tries even more.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.860]   So what does America take away from that?
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.700]   Every single time, if he gets knocked down, he comes back fighting.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:17.320]   And that was a really part of his character that he developed after he got polio.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:23.280]   And it was — it gave him the strength to persevere through personally what he could
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:30.760]   transfer in his calm demeanor and his feeling of fight that America really got that spirit
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.560]   from him and was able to climb itself out of the Great Depression.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.880]   He's such an inspirational figure.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.880]   He really is.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.040]   And I — people think of him for World War II, and of course, you know, we can spend
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   forever on that.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.000]   But in my opinion, the early years are not studied enough.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.320]   '33 to '37 is one of the most remarkable periods in American history.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.000]   We were not ruled by a president, we were ruled by a king, by a monarch, and people
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   liked it.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.720]   He was a dictator, and he was a good one.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.640]   So to sort of push back against the implied thing that you said.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640]   Sure.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.760]   So when — saying Biden is the worst president —
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   No, second worst.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.160]   In modern history, that's what I said.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   Second worst.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   In modern history, who's the worst?
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   W, with no question.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   I see.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   Because of the horrible wars, probably.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.400]   I mean, Iraq is just so bad.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   It's just a mess, yeah.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.320]   One of my favorite authors is a guy, Gene Edward Smith.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.440]   He's written a bunch of presidential biographies.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.240]   And in the opening of his book, W Biography, he's like, "There's just no question this
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.320]   is the single worst foreign policy mistake in all of American history, and W is one of
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.520]   our worst presidents ever."
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.040]   He had terrible judgment.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.520]   And it got us into a war of his own choosing.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.680]   It was a disaster, and it set us up for failure.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.520]   By the way, we talked a lot about Donald Trump.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.600]   Nobody is more responsible for the rise of Donald Trump than George W. Bush, but I could
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.480]   go off on Bush for a long time.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   Oh, we will.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.480]   We will return there.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.440]   So as part of the pushback, I'd like to say, because I agree with your criticism of arrogance
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.800]   and narcissism against Joe Biden, the same could be said about Donald Trump.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   You're absolutely right.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   Of arrogance.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   And I think you've also articulated that a lot of presidents throughout American history
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.840]   have suffered from a bad case of arrogance and narcissism.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.840]   Absolutely.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.840]   But sometimes for our benefit.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.640]   You have to be a pretty crazy person to want to be president.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:17.440]   I put out a tweet that got some controversy, and I think it was Joe Rogan, who I love,
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.720]   but he was like, "I want to find out who Kamala Harris is as a human being."
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.760]   And I was like, "I'm actually not interested in who politicians are as human beings at
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   all."
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.200]   I was like, "I've read too much about them to know."
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.720]   I know who you are.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   If you spend your life, and because I live in Washington and I spend a lot of time around
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.160]   would-be politicians, I know what it takes to actually become the president.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   It's crazy.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.080]   You have to give up everything, everything.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.640]   Every night, you're not spending it with your wife, you're spending it at dinner with potential
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.680]   donors, with friends, with people who can connect you.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.560]   Even after you get elected, that's even more so.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.040]   Now you've got to raise money, and now you're on to the next thing.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.400]   Now you want to get your political thing through.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.240]   You're going to spend all your time on your phone.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.560]   You and your staff are going to be more like this.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.840]   Your entire life revolves around your career.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.560]   Honestly, you need an insane level of narcissism to do it, because you have to believe that
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.960]   you are better than everybody else, which is already pretty crazy.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:14.760]   And not only that, your own personal characteristics and foibles lead you to the pursuit of this
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:20.080]   office and to the pursuit of the idolatry of the self and everything around you.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.400]   There's a famous story of Lady Bird Johnson.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.240]   After Johnson becomes the president, he's talking to the White House butler, and she
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.080]   was like, "Everything in this house revolves around my husband.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.560]   Whatever's left goes to the girls, her two children, and I'll take the scraps."
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.200]   Everything revolved around Johnson's political career.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.000]   And his daughters, when they're honest, because they like to paper over some of the things
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.120]   that happened under him, but they didn't spend any time with him.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.960]   Saturday morning was for breakfast with Richard Russell, I forget.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.920]   These are all in the Robert A. Carrow books.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.840]   Sunday was for Rayburn.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.280]   There was no time for his kids.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.280]   That's what it was.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.040]   And by the way, he's one of the greatest politicians to ever live.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.960]   But he also died from a massive heart attack, and he was a deeply sad and depressed individual.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:09.080]   Yeah, I saw that tweet, to go back to that, and also I listened to your incredible debate
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.520]   about it with Marshall on the Realignment Podcast, and I have to side with Marshall.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.000]   I think you're just wrong on this.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.880]   Because I think revealing the character of a person is really important to understand
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.520]   how they will act in a room full of generals and full of-
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.160]   Yeah, this gets to the judgment question.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   The judgment.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.680]   And that's, I think of Johnson and of Nixon, of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR, I can give
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.800]   you a laundry list of personal problems that all those people had.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:41.480]   I think they had really, really good judgment, and I'm not sure how intrinsic their own personal
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.960]   character was to their exploration and thinking about the world.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.520]   So JFK is, actually, JFK might be our best example, because he had the best judgment
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.200]   out of anybody in the room as a brand new president in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.880]   he got us out and avoided nuclear war, which he deserves eternal credit for that.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.400]   But how did he arrive to good judgment?
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.920]   Some of it certainly was his character, and we can go again, though, into his laundry
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:12.680]   list of that, but most of it was around being with his father, seeing some of the mistakes
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   that he would make.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.400]   And he also had a deeply inquisitive mind, and he experienced World War II at the personal
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.040]   level after PT-109.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.320]   So it is, look, I get it, I actually could steel man it.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.960]   The response to what I'm saying is judgment is not divisible from personal character,
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.000]   but just because I know a lot of politicians, and I've read enough with the really great
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.460]   ones, the people who I revere the most, there's really bad personal stuff basically every
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.460]   single time.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.540]   >>COREY: But you're saying the judgment was good.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.540]   >>STEVE: Yeah, his judgment was great.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.540]   His judgment was great.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.540]   >>COREY: On the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.540]   >>STEVE: Yes.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.720]   >>COREY: Some of the best judgment and decision making in the history of America.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.640]   >>STEVE: Yes, and we should study a lot of it.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.300]   And I encourage people out there, this is a brutal text.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.600]   We were forced to read it in graduate school.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.640]   The Essence of Decision by Graham Allison.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.080]   I'm so thankful we did.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:08.000]   It's one of the foundations of political science because it lays out theories of how government
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   works.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.720]   This is also a useful transition, by the way, if we want to talk about Trump and some of
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:17.840]   his cabinet and how that is shaping up, because people really need to understand Washington.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.600]   Washington is a creature with traditions, with institutions that don't care about you.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.520]   They don't even really care about the president.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.860]   They have self-perpetuating mechanisms which have been done a certain way, and it usually
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:36.040]   takes a great shocking event like World War II to change really anything beyond the marginal.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   Every once in a while you have a figure like Teddy Roosevelt who's actually able to take
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.920]   peacetime presidency and transform the country, but it needs an extraordinary individual to
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.600]   get something like that done.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:49.440]   So the question around the Essence of Decision was the theory behind the Cuban Missile Crisis
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.680]   of how Kennedy arrived at his decision.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.360]   There are various different schools of thought, but one of the things I love about the book
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.540]   is it presents a case for all three, the organizational theory, the bureaucratic politics theory,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.520]   and then kind of the great man theory as well.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.200]   You and I could sit here and I could tell you a case about PT-109 and about how John
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.880]   F. Kennedy experienced World War II as this, I think he was like a first lieutenant or
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.920]   something like that, and how he literally swam miles with a wounded man's life jacket
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.200]   strap in his teeth with a broken back, and he saved him and he ended up on the cover
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.400]   of Life magazine and he was a war hero.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:31.160]   And he was a deeply smart individual who wrote a book in 1939 called Why England Slept, which
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:38.520]   to this day is considered a text which at the moment was able to describe in detail
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.400]   why Neville Chamberlain and the British political system arrived at the policy of appeasement.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.880]   I actually have a original copy, it's one of my most prized possessions, and from 1939
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.600]   because this is a 23-year-old kid, who the fuck are you, John F. Kennedy?
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.140]   Turns out he's a brilliant man.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.480]   And another just favorite aside is that at the Potsdam Conference, where Harry Truman
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.260]   is there with Stalin and everybody.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.920]   So in the room at the same time, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States, Dwight
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:10.960]   D. Eisenhower, the general, who will succeed him, 26-year-old John F. Kennedy as a journalist,
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.400]   some shithead journalist on the side, and all three of those presidents were in the
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.520]   same room with Joseph Stalin and others.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.600]   And that's the story of America right there.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.040]   And I love people to say that because you never know about who will end up rising to
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   power.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.960]   Are you announcing that you're running for president?
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.080]   No, absolutely not.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.080]   I don't have what it takes.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   I don't think so.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   I'm self-aware.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.600]   Well, maybe humility is necessary for greatness.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   Okay.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.200]   So actually, can we just linger on that book?
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:44.620]   So the book "Essence of Decision, Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis" by Graham Allison,
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.160]   it presents three different models of how government works.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:54.040]   The rational actor model, so seeing government as one entity, trying to maximize the national
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.760]   interest.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:01.040]   Also seeing government as, through the lens of the momentum of standard operating procedures,
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:08.180]   sort of this giant organization that's just doing things how it's always been done.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:15.040]   And the government politics model of there's just these individual internal power struggles
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.440]   within government.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:22.200]   And all of that is like a different way to view, and they're probably all true to a degree
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.640]   of how decisions are made within this giant machinery of government.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.680]   That's why it's so important is because you cannot read that book and say one is true
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   and one is not.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.280]   You can say one is more true than the other, but all of them are deeply true.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.960]   And this is one, this is probably a good transition to Donald Trump, because, and I guess for
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.880]   the people out there who don't think I've been up too obsequious, he'll be my criticism,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.800]   Trump said something very fundamental and interesting on the Joe Rogan podcast, probably
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:50.000]   the most important thing that he ever said, which is he said, "I like to have people like
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.240]   John Bolton in my administration, well, because they scare people and it makes me seem like
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.520]   the most rational individual in the room."
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.400]   So at a very intuitive level, a lot of people can understand that, and then they can rationalize
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   while there are picks that Donald Trump has brought into his White House, people like
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.360]   Mike Waltz and others that have espoused views that are directly at odds with a "anti-Neo
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.240]   Con, anti-Liz Cheney agenda."
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:21.920]   Now Trump's theory of this is that he likes to have "psychopaths" like John Bolton in
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.560]   the room with him while he's sitting across from Kim Jong-un because it gets scared.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.480]   What I think Trump never understood when he was president, and I honestly question if
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.240]   he still does now, is those two theories that you laid out, which are not about the rational
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.400]   interest as the government is one model, but the bureaucratic theory and the organizational
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.760]   theory of politics.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.940]   And because what Trump, I don't think, quite gets is that there are 99% of the decisions
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.360]   that get made in government never reach the president's desk.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.740]   One of the most important Obama quotes ever is, "By the time it gets to my desk, nobody
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.040]   else can solve it.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.520]   All the problems here are hard.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.160]   All the problems here don't have an answer.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.680]   That's why I have to make the call."
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:02.320]   So the theory that Trump has, that you can have people in there who are, let's say, warmongers,
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.920]   neocons, or whatever, who don't necessarily agree with you, is that when push comes to
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.440]   shove at the most important decisions, that I'll still be able to rein those people in
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.520]   as an influence.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.880]   Here's the issue.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.960]   Let's say for Mike Waltz, who's going to be the national security advisor, a lot of people
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.040]   don't really understand there's this theory of national security advisor where you call
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.640]   me into your office and you're the president, and you're like, "Hey, what do we think about
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   Iran?"
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   I'm like, "I think you should do X, Y, and Z."
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   No, that's not how it works.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.120]   The national security advisor's job is to coordinate the interagency process.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.400]   So his job is to actually convene meetings, him and his staff, where in the situation
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.640]   room, CIA, State Department, SecDef, others.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.160]   Before the POTUS even walks in, we have options.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.000]   So we're like, "Hey, Russia just invaded Ukraine.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.080]   We need a package of options."
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.200]   Those packages of options are going to concede of three things.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.560]   We're going to have one group, we're going to call it the dovish option.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.480]   Two, we're going to call it the middle ground.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.380]   Three, the hardcore package.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.480]   Trump walks in, this is how it's supposed to work.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.080]   Trump walks in and he goes, "Okay, Russia invaded Ukraine.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   What do we do?
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.600]   Mr. President, we've prepared three options for you.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.960]   We've got one, two, and three.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.040]   Now who has the power?
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.840]   Is it Trump when he picks one, two, or three?
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.720]   Or is the man who decides what's even in option one, two, and three?"
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:13.120]   That is the part where Trump needs to really understand how these things happen.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.040]   And I watched this happen to him in his first administration.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.280]   He hired a guy, Mike Flynn, who was his national security advisor.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.520]   You could say a lot about Flynn, but him and Trump were at least like this on foreign policy.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   Flynn gets outed because of what I would call an FBI coup, whatever, 33 days.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.840]   He's out as a national security advisor.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.880]   H.R. McMaster, he's got a nice, shiny uniform, four star, all of this.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.800]   McMaster doesn't agree with Donald Trump at all.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.680]   And so Trump says, "I ran on pulling out of Afghanistan.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.680]   I want to get out of Afghanistan."
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.360]   They're like, "Yeah, yeah, we'll get out of Afghanistan.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.600]   But before we get out, we got to go back in, as in we need more troops in there."
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.920]   And he's like, "Oh, okay."
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:55.120]   It's like all this, and he approves a plan and effectively gives a speech in 2017, where
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:59.480]   he ends up escalating and increasing the number of troops in Afghanistan.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.560]   And it's only until February 2020 that he gets to sign a deal, the Taliban peace deal,
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.560]   which in my opinion, he should have done in 2017.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.600]   But the reason why that happened was because of that organizational theory, of that bureaucratic
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.920]   politics theory, where H.R. McMaster is able to guide the interagency process, bring the
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.880]   uniform recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others, just give Donald Trump
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.880]   no option but to say, "We must put troops."
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.120]   Another example of this is a book called "Obama's War" by Bob Woodward.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.320]   I highly encourage people to read this book, because this book talks about how Obama comes
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.760]   into the White House in 2009, and he says, "I want to get out of Iraq, and I don't want
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.760]   to increase...
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.440]   I want to fight the good war in Afghanistan," right?
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   And he's doing...
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.700]   Obama's a thoughtful guy, too thoughtful, actually.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:46.120]   And so he sits there, and he's working out his opinions, and what he starts to watch
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.920]   is that very slowly, his narrow...
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:54.160]   His options begin to narrow, because strategic leaks start to come out from the White House
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.760]   Situation Room about what we should do in Afghanistan.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:02.520]   And pretty soon, David Petraeus and Stan McChrystal and the entire national security apparatus
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:09.200]   has Obama pegged, where he basically, politically at the time, decides to take the advantage
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.900]   possession of increasing troops in Afghanistan, but then tries to have it both ways by saying,
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.000]   "But in two years, we're going to withdraw."
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.760]   That book really demonstrates how the deep state can completely remove any of your options
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.420]   to be able to move by presenting you with ones which you don't even want, and then making
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:33.440]   it politically completely infeasible to travel down the extreme directions.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.740]   That's why when Trump says things like, "I want to get out of Syria," that doesn't compute
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.700]   up here for the Pentagon.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.040]   Because first of all, if I even asked you how many troops we have in Syria, and you
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.940]   go on the DOD website, it'll tell you a number.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.540]   That number's bullshit, because the way that they do it is if you're only there for 179
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:51.340]   days, you don't count as active, military contracts, the real number's, let's say, five
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.340]   times.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.100]   And so Trump would be like, "Hey, I want to get out of Syria."
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.100]   "Yeah, we'll do it.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.100]   Six months, right?
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.100]   We need six months."
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.080]   And after six months ago, he said, "So, are we out of Syria yet?"
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.080]   And they're like, "No.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.080]   Well, we got to wrap this up.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   We got this base.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   We got that.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.080]   And we have this important mission.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.640]   And next thing you know, you're out of office, and it's over."
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.920]   So there's all these things which I don't think he quite understands.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.240]   I know that some of the people around him who disagree with these picks do.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.720]   Is the reason why these picks really matter is not only are the voices in the Situation
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.980]   Room for the really, really high-profile stuff, it's for all the little things that never
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.600]   get to that president's desk, of which can shape extraordinary policy.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.800]   And I'll give you the best example.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:32.700]   There was never a decision by FDR as president of the United States to oil embargo Japan,
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.920]   one which he thought about as deeply as you and I would want.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.160]   It was a decision kind of made within the State Department.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.680]   It was a decision that was made by some of his advisors.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.480]   I think he eventually signed off on it.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.880]   It was a conscious choice, but it was not one which ever was understood the implications
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.840]   that by doing that, we invite a potential response like Pearl Harbor.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:56.520]   So think about what the organizational bureaucratic model can tell us about the extraordinary blowback
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:01.240]   that we can get, and why we want people with great judgment all the way up and down the
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.560]   entire national security chain in the White House.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:08.200]   Also, I just realized I did not talk about immigration, which is so insane.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:12.480]   One of the reasons Donald Trump won in 2024, of course, was because of the massive change
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.260]   to the immigration status quo.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.920]   The truth is that it may actually be second to inflation in terms of the reason that Trump
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.360]   did win the presidency was because Joe Biden fundamentally changed the immigration status
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.500]   quo in this country.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.280]   That was another thing about the Scots-Irish people and others that we need to understand
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:34.180]   is that when government machinery and elitism and liberalism appears to be more concerned
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:39.040]   about people who are coming here in a disorderly and illegal process and about their rights
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:44.720]   and their ability to "pursue the American dream" while the American dream is dying for
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.920]   the native-born population, that is a huge reason why people are turning against mass
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.920]   immigration.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:56.480]   Historically as well, my friend Rehan Salam wrote a book called Melting Pot or Civil War,
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.780]   and one of the most important parts about that book is the history of mass migration
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.920]   to the United States.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:08.840]   So if we think about the transition from Scots-Irish America to the opening of America to the Irish
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:14.820]   and to mass European immigration, what a lot of people don't realize is it caused a ton
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:15.820]   of problems.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:20.040]   There were mass movements at that time, the Know-Nothings and others in the 1860s, who
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.000]   rose up against mass European migration.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.960]   They were particularly concerned about Catholicism as the religion of a lot of the new immigrants.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.300]   But really what it was is about the changing of the American character by people who don't
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:39.580]   have the same traditions, values, and skills as the native-born population, and their understanding
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:44.360]   of what they're owed and their role in American society is very different from the way that
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.360]   people previously had.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:50.520]   One of the most tumultuous periods of U.S. politics was actually during the resolution
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:55.680]   of the immigration question, where we had massive waves of foreign-born population come
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.400]   to the United States.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:04.220]   We had them integrated, luckily actually at the time, with the Industrial Revolution,
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.200]   so we actually did have jobs for them.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:10.320]   One of the problems is that today in the United States, we have one of the highest levels
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:15.820]   of foreign-born population than ever before, actually since that time in the early 1900s,
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.400]   but we have all of the same attendant problems.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.320]   But even worse is we don't live in an industrial economy anymore.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:27.280]   We live in a predominantly service-based economy that has long moved past manufacturing.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.040]   Now I'm not saying we shouldn't bring some of that back, but the truth is that manufacturing
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.600]   today is not what it was to work in a steel mill in 1875.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   I think we can all be reasonable and we can agree on that.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.160]   And part of the problems with extremely high levels of foreign-born population, particularly
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.140]   unskilled, and the vast majority of the people who are coming here and who are claiming asylum
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.440]   are doing so under fraudulent purposes.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:54.200]   They're doing so because they are economic migrants and they're abusing asylum law to
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:59.120]   basically gain entrance to the United States without going through a process of application
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.280]   or of merit.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:06.280]   And this has all of its traces back to 1965, where the Immigration and Naturalization Act
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:13.440]   of 1965 really reversed and changed the status quo of immigration from the 1920s to 1960,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.920]   which really shut down levels of immigration in the United States.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.720]   In my opinion, it was one of the most important things that ever happened.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.820]   And one of the reasons why is it forced and caused integration.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:30.100]   It also forced, by slowing down the increase in the number of foreign-born population,
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:35.800]   it redeveloped an American character and understanding that was more homogenous and was the ability
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.200]   for you and me to understand despite the difference in our background.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:44.680]   If you accelerate and you continue this trend of the very high foreign-born, unskilled population,
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:53.080]   you unfortunately are basically creating a non-citizen population of illegal immigrants,
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.120]   people who are not as skilled.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:01.500]   I read 27% of the people who've come under Joe Biden illegally don't even have a college
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.500]   degree.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.660]   That means that we're lucky if they're even literate in Spanish, let alone English.
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:10.520]   So there are major problems about integrating that type of person.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:16.160]   Even in the past, whenever we had a mass industrial economy, now imagine today, the amount of
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.520]   strain that would put on social services if mass citizenship happened to that population
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.680]   would be extraordinary.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.480]   And even if we were to do, I don't think it's a good idea, but even if we were to do so,
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.980]   we would still need to pair it with a dramatic change.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.760]   And part of the problem right now is, I don't think a lot of people understand the immigration
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   system.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.600]   The immigration system in the United States effectively, they call it family-based migration.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.940]   I call it chain migration.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:48.680]   Chain migration is the term which implies that, let's say you come over here and you
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:53.560]   get your green card, you can use sponsorship and others by gaming the quota system to get
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.040]   your cousin or whatever, to be able to come.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.960]   The problem with that is, who is your cousin?
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   Is he a plumber?
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   Is he a coder?
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.840]   That doesn't actually matter because he's your cousin, so he actually has preference.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.900]   The way that it should work is it should be, nobody cares if he's your cousin.
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.400]   What does he do?
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.440]   What does she do?
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.000]   What is she going to bring to this country?
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.040]   All immigration in the United States, in my opinion, should be net positive without doing
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.560]   fake statistics about, "Oh, they actually increased the GDP," or whatever.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.240]   It's like, we need a merit-based immigration system.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:26.280]   We are the largest country in the world, and one of the only non-Western, or one of the
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.680]   only Western countries in the world that does not have a merit-based, points-based immigration
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.960]   system, like Australia and/or Canada.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.520]   I get it because a lot of people did come to this country under non-merit-based purposes,
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.800]   so they're really reluctant to let that go, but I do think that Biden, by changing the
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:47.200]   immigration status quo and by basically just allowing tens of millions, potentially tens
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:52.760]   of millions, at the very least 12 million, new entrants to come to the US under these
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:55:00.440]   pretenses of complete disorder and of no conduct, really broke a lot of people's understanding
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:06.160]   and even mercy in that regard, and so that was obviously a massive part of Trump's victory.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.920]   Speaking of illegal immigration, what do you think about what the borders are?
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   Tom Holman.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.600]   Tom Holman is a very legit dude.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.200]   Got to know him a little bit in Trump 1.0.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:24.920]   He is an original, true believer on enforcing immigration law, as it is.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.520]   Now, notice how I just said that.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:30.040]   That's a politically correct way of saying mass deportation.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:39.880]   I will point out for my left-wing critics in that, yeah, he really believes in the ability
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:43.600]   in the necessity of mass deportation, and he has the background to be able to carry
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   that out.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.240]   I will give some warnings, and this will apply to Doge, too.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.480]   Czar has no statutory or constitutional authority.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.320]   Czar has as much authority as the President of the United States gives him.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.200]   Donald Trump, I think it's fair to say, even his critics or even the people who love him
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:05.520]   could say, he can be capricious at times, and he can strip you or not strip you or give
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.720]   you the ability to compel.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:12.080]   Czar, in and of itself, is frankly a very flawed position in the White House, and it's
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.440]   one that I really wish we would move away from.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.920]   I understand why we do it.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:21.320]   It's basically to do a national security advisor, interagency convener to accomplish certain
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:22.480]   goals.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.000]   That said, there is a person, Stephen Miller, who will be in the White House, the deputy
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:33.340]   White House chief of staff, who has well-founded beliefs, experience in government, and a rock-solid
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:37.160]   ideology on this, which I think would also give him the ability to work with Homan to
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.440]   pull that off.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:44.700]   That said, the corollary to this, and frankly, this is the one I am the most mystified yet,
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:49.240]   is Kirstjen Noem as the Department of Homeland Security secretary.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.680]   So let me just lay this out for people because people don't know what this is.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.840]   The Department of Homeland Security, 90% of the time the way you're going to interact
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.960]   with them is TSA.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.280]   You don't think about it.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.120]   But people don't know, the Department of Homeland Security is one of the largest law enforcement,
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.560]   if maybe the largest law enforcement agency in the world.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.720]   It's gigantic.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:12.220]   You have extraordinary statutory power to be able to prove investigations.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:17.920]   You have Border Patrol, ICE, TSA, CBP, all these other agencies that report up to you.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.880]   But most importantly for this, you will be the public face of mass deportation.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.620]   So I was there in the White House briefing room last time around when Kirstjen Nielsen,
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.800]   who was the DHS secretary under Donald Trump and specifically the one who enforced child
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:36.200]   separation for a limited period of time, she was a smart woman.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:42.000]   She has long experience in government, and honestly, she melted under the criticism.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.080]   Kirstjen Noem is the governor of South Dakota.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.080]   I mean, that's great.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.760]   You have a little bit of executive experience.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.840]   But to be honest, I mean, you have no law enforcement background.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:55.240]   You have no ability to, you have no, frankly, with understanding of what it is going to
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.680]   be like to be the secretary of one of the most controversial programs in modern American
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   history.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.200]   You have to go on television and defend that every single day, a literal job requirement
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.560]   under Donald Trump.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.920]   And you will have to have extraordinary command of the facts.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.840]   You have to have a very high intellect.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.860]   You have to have the ability to really break through.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:20.160]   And I mean, we all watched how she handled that situation with her dog and her interviews,
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.920]   and that does not give me confidence that she will be able to do all that well in the
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   position.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.920]   So what do you think is behind that?
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:34.360]   So, Crystal, the breaking point is that there is some kind of interpersonal, like, I didn't
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   know.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:40.800]   I guess I should know this, but I didn't know any of the there was some cheating or
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.800]   whatever.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.000]   There's a rumor, nobody knows if it's true, that Corey Lewandowski and Kirstjen Noem had
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.640]   a previous relationship and ongoing Corey Lewandowski is a Trump official and that he
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.280]   may be put her in front.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.280]   I don't know.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.560]   It's like the real Housewives of D.C.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.560]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.520]   Although, I mean, it was the most open secret in the world.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   Allegedly.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.520]   I don't know if it's true.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.520]   OK.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.520]   All right.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.520]   I mean, I don't like to traffic too much in personal theories.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:05.760]   But I mean, in this respect, it might actually be correct in terms of how it all came down.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.600]   I have no idea what he's thinking to be.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.880]   I truly don't.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.840]   I mean, maybe it's like he was last time.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:15.600]   He said, I want a woman who's like softer and like emotionally in the ability to be
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.000]   the face of my immigration program.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.540]   I mean, again, like I said, I don't see it in terms of her experience and her media.
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.440]   It's frankly like not very good.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:32.800]   So you think she needs to be able to articulate, not just be like the softer face of this radical
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.600]   policy, but also be able to articulate what's happening with the reasoning behind all this?
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   Yes.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   You need to give justification for everything.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.600]   Here's the thing.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   You need to give justification.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:47.240]   The media will drag up every sob story known to planet Earth about this person and that
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.800]   person who came here illegally and why they deserve to stay and really what the quasi
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   thing is.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   That's why the program itself is bad.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.760]   And we should legalize everybody who is here illegally.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.760]   OK.
[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.480]   So the thing is, is that you need to be able to have extraordinary oversight.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.880]   You need a great team with you.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.640]   You need to make sure that everything is being done by the book.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.820]   The way that the media is being handled is that you throw every question back in their
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.760]   face and you say, well, you know, you either talk about crime or you talk about the enforceability
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.160]   of the law, the necessity.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:20.600]   I mean, I just I think articulated a very coherent case for why we need much less high
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.540]   levels of immigration to the United States.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:27.000]   And I am the son of people who immigrated to this country.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   But one of the favorite phrases I heard from this from a guy named Mark Krikorian, who's
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.080]   a center for immigration studies, is we don't make immigration policy for the benefit of
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.640]   our grandparents.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.320]   We make immigration policy for the benefit of our grandchildren.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.160]   And that is an extraordinary and good way to put it.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.080]   And in fact, I would say it's a triumph of the American system that somebody whose parent
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.680]   family benefited from the immigration regime and was able to come here.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.520]   My parents had Ph.D.s, came here legally, applied, spent thousands of dollars through
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.640]   the process, can arrive at the conclusion that actually we need to care about all of
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.400]   our fellow American citizens.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.280]   I'm not talking about other Indians or, you know, whatever.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.280]   I'm talking about all of it.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.760]   I care about everybody who is here in this country.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.960]   But fundamentally, that will mean that we are going to have to exclude some people from
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960]   the U.S.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:20.080]   And another thing that the open borders people don't ever really grapple with is that even
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.920]   within their own framework, it makes no sense.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:28.880]   So for example, a common left wing talking point is that it's America's fault that El
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.080]   Salvador and Honduras and Central America is fucked up.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.640]   And so because of that, we have a responsibility to take all those people in because it's our
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   fault or Haiti.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   Right.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.680]   But, you know, if you think about it, America is responsible.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.280]   And I'm just being honest for destroying and ruining a lot of countries today.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.320]   They just don't benefit from the geographic like ability to walk to the United States.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.600]   So I mean, if we're doing grievance politics, Iraqis have way more of a claim to be able
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.960]   to come here than anybody from El Salvador who's talking about something that happened
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.800]   in 1982.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.520]   So within its own logic, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.440]   Even under the asylum process, you know, people I mean, people don't even know this.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.280]   You're literally able to claim asylum from domestic violence.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   OK.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.280]   There are.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.280]   I mean, imagine that.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.560]   Like, that's frankly, that is a local law enforcement and problem of people who are
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.440]   experiencing that in their home country.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.440]   I know how cold hearted this sounds, but maybe honestly, it could be because I'm Indian.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.400]   One of the things that whenever you visit India and you see a country with over a billion
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.280]   people, you're like, holy shit, you know, this this is crazy.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.440]   And you understand both the sheer numbers of the amount of people involved.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.660]   And also, there is nothing in the world you could ever do to solve all problems for everybody.
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.480]   It's a very complex and dynamic problem.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.320]   And it's really nice to be bleeding heart and to say, oh, well, we have responsibility
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.520]   to this and to all mankind and all that.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.520]   But it doesn't work.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.720]   It doesn't work with a nation state.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.400]   It doesn't work with a sovereign nation.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.520]   We're the luckiest people in the history of the world to live here in this country.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:03.000]   And it you need to protect it and protecting it requires really thinking about the fundamentals
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.400]   of immigration itself and not telling us stories like what there's a famous moment in the Trump
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.560]   White House where Jim Acosta, CNN White House correspondent, got into it with Stephen Miller,
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.000]   the current, you know, who will be the current deputy chief.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.600]   And he was like, what do you say?
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.040]   Something along the lines to people who say you're violating, you know, that quote on
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.560]   the Statue of Liberty, like, give me you're tired, you're poor, you're hungry, all of
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.200]   that, the Emma Lazarus quote.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.200]   And Stephen very logically was like, what level of immigration comports with the Emma
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.240]   Lazarus quote?
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.840]   Is it 200,000 people a year?
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.960]   Is it 300?
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960]   Is it 1 million?
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.720]   Is it 1.5 million?
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.120]   And that's such a great way of putting it because there is no limiting principle on
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.560]   Emma Lazarus quote.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.640]   There is when you start talking honestly, you're like, okay, we live in X, Y, and Z
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.800]   society with X, Y, and Z GDP.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.880]   People who are coming here should be able to benefit for themselves and us, not rely
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.600]   on welfare, not, you know, be people who we have to take care of after because we have
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.360]   our own problems here right now.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.480]   And who are the population, the types of people that we can study and look at, who will be
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.720]   able to benefit?
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.240]   And based on that, yeah, immigration is great.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:17.960]   But there are a lot of economic, legal, and societal reasons for why you definitely don't
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.320]   want the current level.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:26.720]   But another thing is even if we turn the switch and we still let in a million and five people
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:33.140]   a year under the chain family-based migration, I think it would be a colossal mistake because
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:37.880]   it's not rooted in the idea that people who are coming to America are explicitly doing
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.780]   so at the benefit of America.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:44.020]   It's doing so based on the familial connections of people who already gamed the immigration
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.560]   system to be able to come here.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.520]   I have a lot of family in India and, you know, I love them, but, and some of them are actually
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.040]   very talented and qualified.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.080]   If they wanted to come here, I think they should be able to apply on their own merit
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.360]   and that should have nothing to do with their familial status to the fact that I'm a U.S.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360]   citizen.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.480]   Like you mentioned the book "Melting Pot" or "Civil War" by Raihan Salam, he makes an
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.680]   argument against open borders.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.600]   The thesis there is assimilation should be a big part.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.640]   I guess there's some kind of optimal rate of immigration which allows for assimilation.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640]   And there are ebbs and flows.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.320]   That's kind of what I was talking about historically where, you know, I mean, the truth is, is
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.880]   you could walk the streets of New York City in the early 1900s and late 1890s and you're
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.280]   not going to hear any English.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.280]   And I think that's bad.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.040]   I mean, really what you had was ethnic enclaves of people who were basically practicing their
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.120]   way of life just like they did previously, bringing over a lot of their ethnic problems
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.080]   that they had and even some of their cultural, like unique capabilities or whatever, bringing
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.400]   it to America and then New York City police and others are figuring out like, "What the
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.040]   hell do we do with all this?"
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:51.160]   And it literally took shutting down immigration for an entire generation to do away with that.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.600]   And there's actually still some.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.240]   The point about assimilation is twofold.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:01.900]   One is that you should have the capacity to inherit the understanding of the American
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.000]   character that has nothing to do with race.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.840]   And that's so unique that I can sit here as a child of people from India and have such
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.200]   a deep appreciation for the Scots-Irish.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.560]   I consider myself, you know, American first.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.840]   And one of the things that I really love about that is that I have no historical relationship
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.720]   to anybody who fought in the Civil War, but I feel such kinship with a lot of the people
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:33.200]   who did and reading the memoirs and the ideas of those that did because that same mindset
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:39.680]   of the victors and the values that they were able to instill in the country for 150 years
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.400]   later gives me the ability to connect to them.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.380]   And that's such an incredible victory on their part.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:48.480]   And that's such a unique thing in almost every other country in the world, in China, in India
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.240]   or wherever, you're kind of like what you are.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.520]   You're a Hindu, you're a Jew, you're Han Chinese, you're a Uyghur or you're Tibetan, something
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.520]   like that.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.520]   You're born into it.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.320]   And really here was one of the only places in the world where you can really connect
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   to that story and that spirit and the compounding effect of all of these different people who
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.360]   have come to America.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.920]   And that is a celebration of immigration as an idea.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.640]   But immigration is also a discreet policy.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:18.900]   And that policy was really screwed up by the Biden administration.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:24.160]   And so we can celebrate the idea and also pursue a policy for all of the people in the
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.920]   U.S., our citizens, to actually be able to benefit.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.800]   And look, it's going to be messy.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.840]   And honestly, I still don't know yet if Trump will be able to pursue actual mass deportation,
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.640]   just because I think that I'm not sure the public is ready for it.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.960]   I do support mass deportation.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.080]   I don't know if the public is ready for it.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.720]   I think, I don't know.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.280]   I'll have to see because there's a lot of different ways that you can do it.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.880]   There's mandatory verify, which requires businesses to basically verify you're a U.S. citizen
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.400]   or you're here legally whenever they employ you, which is not the law of the land currently,
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.360]   which is crazy, by the way.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:01.240]   There's, you know, you can cut off or tax remittance payments, which are payments that
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.200]   are sent back to other countries like Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala, again, illustrating
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.240]   my economic migrant point.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.400]   There are a lot of various different ways where you just make it more difficult to be
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.600]   illegally here in the U.S. so people will self-deport.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.240]   But you know, if he does pursue like real mass deportation, that will be a flashpoint
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   in America.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:26.320]   Aren't you talking about things like what Tom Homan said, worksite raids, sort of increasing
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320]   the rate of that?
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.320]   We used to do that, you know?
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:37.280]   But there's a rate at which you can do that where it would lead to, I mean, radical social
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   upheaval.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   Yeah, it will.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.240]   I mean, and I think some people need to be honest here, and this actually flies in the
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:49.760]   face of, I mean, one of the most common liberal critiques is this is going to raise prices.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.960]   And yeah, I think it's true.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960]   I think it's worth it.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.040]   But that's easy for me to say.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.680]   I'm making a good living.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:59.360]   If you care about inflation, you voted for Donald Trump and your price of groceries or
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.840]   whatever goes up because of this immigration policy, I think that needs to be extremely
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.480]   well articulated by the president.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.360]   And of course he needs to think about it.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.520]   The truth is, is America right now is built on cheap labor.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.480]   It's not fair to the consumer.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.880]   It's not fair to the immigrants, the illegal immigrants themselves, and it's not fair to
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   the natural born citizen.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:23.320]   The natural born citizen has his wages suppressed for competition by tens of millions of people
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:28.320]   who are willing to work at lower wages that compete for housing, for social services.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.520]   I mean, just even, you know, like basic stuff at a societal level, it's not fair to them.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.360]   It's definitely not fair to the other person because, I mean, whenever people say like,
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:44.280]   who's going to build your houses or whatever, you're endorsing this quasi legal system where,
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:50.960]   you know, uninsured laborers from Mexico, they have no guarantee of wages.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.000]   They're getting paid cash under the table.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.240]   They are living, you know, 10 to a room.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.040]   They're sending Mexican remittance payments back just so that their children can eat.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.580]   I mean, that's not really fair to that person either.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:03.600]   So that's the point.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.100]   The point is, is that it will lead to a lot of social upheaval.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:11.800]   But this gets to my Kirstie Noem point as well, is you need to be able to articulate
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.000]   a lot of what I just said here, because if you don't, it's going to go south real quick.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.680]   The way Vivek articulates this is that our immigration system is deeply dishonest.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.880]   Like we don't acknowledge some of the things he just said.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.880]   And he wants to make it honest.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.080]   So if we don't do mass deportation, at least you have to be really honest about the living
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:37.800]   conditions of illegal immigrants, about basically mistreatment of them.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800]   Yes, it's true.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.860]   I mean, you know, if you support mass illegal migration, you're basically supporting tens
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:48.300]   of millions who are living lives as second class citizens.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.520]   That's not fair to them.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.040]   I also think it's deeply paternalistic.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:58.400]   So there's this idea that America has so ruined these Central American countries that they
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.480]   have no agency whatsoever, and they can never turn things around.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.680]   What does that say about our confidence in them?
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.080]   You know, one of the things they always say, "Oh, they're law abiding.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.080]   They're great people," and all that.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.080]   I agree, okay?
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080]   By and large.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.160]   I'm not saying these are bad people, but I am saying like, if they're not bad and they're
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.600]   law abiding and they're citizens and thoughtful and all that, they can fix their own countries.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.280]   And they did in El Salvador.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.840]   That's the perfect example.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.360]   Look at the dramatic drop in their crime rate.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.440]   Bukele is one of the most popular leaders in all of South America.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.240]   That is proof positive that you can change things around, despite perhaps a legacy of
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.240]   US intervention.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.520]   So, you know, to just say this idea that, you know, because it's America's fault that
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.120]   they're screwed up, it takes agency away from them.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.640]   You know, another really key part of this dishonesty, this really gets to Springfield
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:50.960]   and the whole Haitian thing because everybody, you know, beyond the eating cats and dogs,
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.560]   everybody does not even acknowledge because when they're like, the Haitians are here legally,
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.120]   they need to actually think about the program.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.600]   The program is called TPS, so let me explain that.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.240]   TPS is called Temporary Protected Status.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.480]   Note, what's the first word in that?
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480]   Temporary.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480]   What does that mean?
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.720]   TPS was developed under a regime in which, let's say that there was a catastrophic, I
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.840]   think this is a real example, I think there was like a volcano or an earthquake or something
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.680]   where people were granted TPS to come to the United States.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.000]   And the idea was they were going to go back after it was safe.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.080]   They just never went back.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.680]   There are children born in the United States today who are literally the descent, who are
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:33.080]   adults, who are the descendants of people who are still living in the US under TPS.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.760]   That's a perfect example of what Vivek says is dishonest.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.880]   You know, you can't mass de facto legalize people by saying that they're here temporarily
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.760]   because of a program or because of something that happened in their home country, when
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:52.640]   the reality is that, for all intents and purposes, we are acknowledging them as full legal migrants.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.320]   So even the term migrant to these Haitians in Springfield makes no sense because they're
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.640]   supposed to be here under TPS.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.360]   That's not, migrant implies permanency.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.840]   So the language is all dishonest.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.440]   And people don't want to tell you about the things I just said about chain migration.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.480]   The vast majority of Americans don't even know that immigration system works.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.600]   They don't understand what I just said about TPS.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.800]   They don't really understand the insanity of asylum law, where you can just literally
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.200]   throw up your hands and say, I fear for my life.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.040]   And you get to live here for four or five years before your court date even happens.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.800]   And by that time, get a work permit or whatever.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.960]   You can get housing, like you just said, in substandard conditions.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.920]   And you can kind of just play the game and wait before a deportation order comes.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.080]   And even if it does, you never have to leave because there's no ICE agent or whatever who's
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.160]   going to enforce it.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.840]   So the whole system is nuts right now.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.000]   And we need complete systematic reform that burns it all to the ground.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.640]   - That said, sort of the image and the reality of a child being separated from their parents
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.680]   seems deeply un-American, right?
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:59.720]   - Well, I mean, look, it gets, okay, so, you know, I'm not going to defend it, but I'll
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   just put it this way.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.120]   - Do you hate children?
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.840]   - Yeah, see, that's what I mean.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.480]   Do you think twice whenever you see a drug addict who's put in prison and their child
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.120]   is put in protective services?
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.760]   Nobody in America thinks twice about that, right?
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.040]   So I mean, well, that's kind of screwed up.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.080]   Well, we should think about why did we come to that conclusion?
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:26.240]   The conclusion was that these adults willingly broke the law and pursued a path of life which
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.440]   put them on a trajectory where the state had to come in and determine that you are not
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.040]   allowed to be a parent basically to this child while you serve your debt to society.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.880]   Now child separation was very different.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.400]   Child separation was also a product of extremely strange circumstances in U.S. immigration
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.160]   law where basically at the time, the reason why it was happening was because there was
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:54.440]   no way to prosecute people for illegal entry without child separation.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.760]   Because previous doctrine, I believe it's called the Flores Doctrine under some asylum
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.760]   law.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.140]   People will have to go check my work on this.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:07.200]   But basically the whole reason this evolved as a legal regime was because people figured
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.640]   out that if you bring a kid with you because of the so-called Flores Doctrine or whatever,
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.320]   that you couldn't be prosecuted for illegal entry.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.000]   So it was a de facto way of breaking the law.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.840]   And in fact, a lot of people were bringing children here who weren't even theirs, who
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:28.080]   weren't, they weren't even related to or couldn't even prove it, were bringing them to get around
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   the prosecution for illegal entry.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.680]   So I'm not defending child separation.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.480]   I think it was horrible or whatever.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.400]   But if I give you the context, it does seem like a very tricky problem in terms of do
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.560]   we enforce the law or not?
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.320]   How are we able to do that?
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.920]   And the solution, honestly, is what Donald Trump did was remain in Mexico and then pursue
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:55.480]   a complete rewrite of the way that we have U.S. asylum law applied and of asylum adjudication
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.960]   and really just about enforcing our actual laws.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:04.440]   So what I try to explain to people is the immigration system right now is a patchwork
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:11.520]   of this deeply dishonest, such a great word, deeply dishonest system in which you use the
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.580]   system and set it up in such ways that illegal immigration is actually one of the easiest
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.320]   things to do to accomplish immigration to the United States.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   That is wrong.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.000]   My parents had to apply.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   It wasn't easy.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.560]   Do you know, in India, there's a temple called the Visa Temple where you walk one hundred
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.160]   and eight times around it, which is like a lucky number.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.720]   And if you do it when you're applying for a visa to the United States.
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.720]   All right.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.280]   It costs a lot of money and it's hard.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.580]   People get rejected all the time.
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:42.080]   There's billions of people across the world who would love to be able to come here.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.920]   And many of them want to do so legally and they should have to go through a process.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.320]   The current way it works is it's easier to get here illegally than it is legally.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.320]   I think that's fundamentally right.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.520]   It's also unfair to people like us whose parents did come here illegally.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.500]   When you steel me on the case against mass deportation, what are the strongest arguments?
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:02.080]   The strongest argument would be that these people contribute to society, that these people,
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.240]   many of whom millions of here have been here for many years, have children, natural born
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.720]   citizens because of birthright citizenship.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.680]   It would require something that's fundamentally inhumane and un-American, as you said.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.840]   The idea of separating families, you know, across different borders simply because of
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:23.600]   what is a "small decision" of coming here illegally.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:29.840]   And the best case, beyond any of this moral stuff, for no mass deportation is it's good
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.320]   for business.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.880]   Illegal immigration is great for big business.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.200]   It is great for big agriculture.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:41.160]   So if you want the lowest prices of all time, then yeah, mass deportation is a terrible
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160]   idea.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.160]   First of all, very convincing.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:50.840]   And second of all, you can't just do mass deportation without also fixing the immigration
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.840]   system.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.840]   Yes, exactly.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:56.720]   And I mean, there are several pieces of legislation, H.R. 2, that's something that the Republicans
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.280]   have really coalesced around.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.280]   It's a border bill.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.400]   I encourage people to go read it and see some of the different fixes to the U.S. immigration
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   system.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.240]   I'm curious whether it'll actually pass or not.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.320]   Remember there's a very slim majority of the House of Representatives for Republicans this
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.560]   time around, and people vote for a lot of things when they're not in power.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.200]   But when it's actually about to become the law, we'll see.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.960]   There's a lot of swing state people out there who may think twice before casting that vote.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.880]   So I'm definitely curious to see how that one plays out.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:29.000]   The other thing is, is that, like I just said, the biggest beneficiary of illegal immigration
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   is big business.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.680]   So if you think they're going to take this one lying down, absolutely not.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.360]   They will fight for everything that they have to keep their pool of cheap labor, because
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360]   it's great for them.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.920]   I think J.D. said a story, I think he was on Rogan, about how he talked to a hotelier
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.000]   chain guy, and he was like, "Yeah, it's just terrible.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.880]   They would take away our whole workforce."
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.680]   And he was like, "Do you hear yourself in terms of what you're talking, you're bragging
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680]   about?"
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680]   But that's real.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680]   That's a real thing.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:05.520]   And that, Tyson Foods and all these other people, that's another really sad part.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:09.700]   What I mean by second-class citizenship is this presumption, first of all, that Americans
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.160]   think it's too disgusting to process meat or to work in a field.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.560]   I think anybody will do anything for the right wage, first of all.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.400]   But second is the conditions in a lot of those facilities are horrible, and they're covered
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.440]   up for a reason.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.280]   Not only in terms of the way that businesses, the way they actually conduct themselves,
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.760]   but also to cover up their illegal immigrant workforce.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.200]   So honestly, I think it could make things better for everything.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.480]   You have studied how government works, what are the chances mass deportation happens?
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.600]   Well, it depends how you define it.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.980]   So I mean, mass deportation could mean 1 million.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.040]   I mean, nobody even knows how many people are here illegally.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.040]   It could be 20 million.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.040]   It could be 30 million.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.240]   I've seen estimates of up to 30 million, which is crazy.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.720]   That's almost one 11th of the entire US population.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.840]   What number do you think will feel like mass deportation?
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.840]   1 million people?
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.280]   A million people is a lot.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.280]   I mean-
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.280]   That's a lot of people.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.280]   It's a lot.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.880]   I mean, but the crazy part is that's only one 12th of what Joe Biden let in the country.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:04.560]   So that's one of those that just to give people the scale of what it will all look like.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.700]   Do I think mass deportation will happen?
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.460]   It depends on the definition.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:10.960]   Will 1 million over four years?
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.120]   Yeah, I feel relatively confident in that.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.940]   Anything over that, it's going to be tough to say.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:24.040]   Like I said, probably the most efficient way to do it is to have mandatory verify and to
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:29.500]   have processes in place where it becomes very difficult to live in the United States illegally.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:34.840]   And then you will have mass self-deportation and they will take the victory lap on that.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:41.520]   But actual like rounding millions of people up and putting them in deportation facilities
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.840]   and then arranging flights to God knows all across the globe.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.420]   That's a logistical nightmare.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.120]   It also costs a lot of money.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.320]   And don't forget, Congress has to pay for all of this.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:57.520]   So we can have Doge or we can have mass deportation.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.880]   So those two things are kind of irreconcilable, actually.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.760]   There's a lot of competing influences at play that people are not being real about at all.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:11.600]   Yeah, that was one of the tensions I had talking to Vivek is he's big on mass deportation and
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.080]   big on making government more efficient.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.960]   And it really feels like there's a tension between those two in the short term.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.400]   Well, yes, absolutely.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.100]   Also, I mean, this is a good segue.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.680]   I've been wanting to talk about this.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.000]   I am sympathetic to Doge, to the whole Department of Government Efficiency.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.560]   How unreal is it that it's called Doge?
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.280]   Actually with Elon, it's quite real.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.460]   I guess I've just, you know, I've accepted Elon as a major political figure in the U.S.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:42.360]   But the Doge Committee, the Department of Government Efficiency, is a non-statutory
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:48.480]   agency that has zero funding that Donald Trump says will advise OMB, the Office of Management
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.480]   and Budget.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.000]   Now, two things.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.600]   Number one is, as I predicted, Doge would become a quote-unquote Blue Ribbon Commission.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:02.080]   So this is a non-statutory Blue Ribbon Commission that has been given authority to Vivek Ramaswamy
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.800]   and to Elon Musk.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:08.800]   Secondary, their recommendations to government should be complete by July of 2026, according
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.440]   to the press release released by Trump.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.000]   First of all, what that will mean is they're probably gonna need private funding to even
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   set all this up.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   That's great.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   Not a problem for Elon.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.360]   You're basically going to be able to have to commission GAO reports, Government Accountability
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:28.600]   Office, and other reports and fact-finding missions across the government, which is fantastic.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.800]   Trump can even empower you to go through to every agency and to collect figures.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.720]   None of it matters one iota if Republican appropriators in the House of Representatives
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.160]   care what you have to say.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.680]   Historically, they don't give a shit what the executive office has to say.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.320]   So every year, the president releases his own budget.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.840]   It used to mean something, but in the last decade or so, it's become completely meaningless.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.240]   The House Ways and Means Committee and the People's House are the ones who originate
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.760]   all appropriations and set up spending.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.840]   So that's one.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.920]   Is that DOJ in and of itself has no power.
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:06.080]   It has no ability to compel or force people to do anything.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:11.240]   Its entire case for being, really, if you think about it mechanically, is to try and
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:15.840]   convince and provide a report to Republican legislators to be able to cut spending.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:16.840]   So that's that.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:23.000]   Now, we all know how Congress takes to government reports and whether they get acted on or not.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.240]   So that's number one.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.520]   Number two is the figures that Elon is throwing out there, again, I want to give them some
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.960]   advice because people do not understand federal government spending.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:39.440]   The absolute vast majority of government spending is entitlement programs like Social Security
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:43.720]   and Medicare, which are untouchable under Donald Trump and their most politically popular
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:48.520]   programs in the world, and military spending, discretionary non-military spending.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:52.640]   I don't have the exact figure in front of me, is a very, very small part of the federal
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.640]   budget.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:24:00.200]   Now, within that small slice, about 90% of that eight is bipartisan and is supported
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   by everybody.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.760]   NOAA, you know, the hurricane guys, people like that, people who are flying into the
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.880]   eye of the hurricane, people who are government inspectors of X, Y, and Z.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.020]   The parts that are controversial that you're actually able to touch, things like welfare
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:19.960]   programs, like food stamps, is an extraordinary small slice.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:23.300]   So what's the number he put out there, 5 trillion, something like that?
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.000]   There is only one way to do that.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.400]   And realistically, under the current thing, you have to radically change the entire way
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.460]   that the Pentagon buys everything.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:34.800]   And I support that, but I just want to be very, very clear.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.520]   But I haven't seen enough energy around that.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:44.520]   There's this real belief in the US that we spend billions on all of these programs that
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.840]   are doing complete bullshit, but like the truth, the absolute vast majority of it is
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.880]   military spending and entitlements.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.120]   Trump has made clear entitlements are off the table, it's not going to happen.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:58.120]   So the way that you're going to be able to cut realistically military spending over a
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:05.520]   decade long period is to really change the way that the United States procures, you know,
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.000]   procures military equipment, hands out government contracts.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.120]   Elon actually does have the background to be able to accomplish this because he has
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.020]   had to wrangle with SpaceX and the bullshit that Boeing has been pulling for over a decade.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:21.200]   But I really want everybody's expectations to be very set around this.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.240]   Just remember, non-statutory, blue ribbon.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.520]   So if he's serious about it, I just laid out all of these hurdles that he's going to have
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.360]   to overcome.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.760]   And I'm not saying him and Vivek aren't serious dudes, but you got to really know the system
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:36.040]   to be able to accomplish this.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.960]   So you just laid out the reality of how Washington works.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:46.600]   To give the counterpoint that I think you're probably also rooting for, is that one is
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.860]   a statement like Peter Thiel said, "Don't bet against Elon."
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.320]   One of the things that you don't usually have with blue ribbon is the kind of megaphone
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.880]   that Elon has.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.440]   And I would even set the financial aspects aside.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:09.960]   Just the influence he has with the megaphone, but also just with other people who are also
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.660]   really influential.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:15.920]   I think that can have real power when backed by a populist movement.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.800]   I don't disagree with you, but let me give you a case where this just failed.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.920]   So Elon endorsed who for Senate Majority Leader?
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.240]   Rick Scott, right?
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.480]   Who got the least amount of votes in the U.S. Senate for GOP leader, Rick Scott?
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.200]   John Thune is the person who got it.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.680]   Now the reason I'm bringing that up, one of my favorite books, Master of the Senate by
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.200]   Robert Caro, part of the LBJ series.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.160]   The Senate as an institution, it reveres independence.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160]   It reveres...
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.780]   I mean, the entire theory of the Senate is to cool down the mob that is in the House
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.920]   of Representatives and to deliberate.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.800]   That's its entire body.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.120]   They are set up to be immune from public pressure.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.800]   Now I'm not saying they can't be pressured, but that example I just gave on Rick Scott
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.720]   is a very important one of, he literally endorsed somebody for leader.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.080]   So did Tucker Carlson, so did a lot of people online, and only 13 senators voted for Rick
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:08.080]   Scott.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.600]   The truth is, is that they don't care.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:14.360]   They're set up where they're marginally popular in their own home states, they'll be able
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.560]   to win their primaries, and that's all they really need to do to get elected.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.880]   And they have six-year terms, they're not even up for four years.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.960]   So will Elon still be interested in politics six years from now?
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.400]   That's a legitimate question for a Republican senator.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.100]   So maybe he could get the House of Representatives to sign off maybe on some of his things, but
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:34.200]   there's no guarantee that the Senate is going to agree with any of that.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:39.640]   There's a story that Caro tells in the Master of the Senate book, which I love, where Thomas
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.800]   Jefferson was in Paris during the writing of the Constitution, and he asked Washington,
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.920]   he said, "Why did you put in a Senate, a bicameral legislature?"
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.120]   And Washington said, "Why did you pour your tea into a saucer?"
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.960]   And Jefferson goes, "To cool it."
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.760]   And Washington says, "Just so."
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.320]   That's hard to explain.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.720]   He was a man of very few words, he was a brilliant man.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.720]   Okay, so you actually outlined the most likely thing that's going to happen with Doge as
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.880]   it hits the wall of Washington.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:17.340]   What is the most successful thing that can be pulled off?
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:20.800]   The most successful thing they could do is, right now, I think they're really obsessed
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.760]   with designing cuts and identifying cuts.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.800]   I would redesign systems, systems of procurement.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:35.320]   I would redesign the way that we have processes in place to dispense taxpayer dollars.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.280]   Because the truth is, is that appropriations itself, again, are set by the United States
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:47.320]   Congress, but the way that those appropriations are spent by the government, the executive
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.720]   has some discretionary authority.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:55.320]   So your ability as the executive to be a good steward of the taxpayer money and to redesign
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.040]   a system, which actually, I think Elon could be good at this, and Vivek too, in terms of
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.720]   their entrepreneurial spirit, is the entire Pentagon procurement thing, it needs to be
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.980]   burned to the ground.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:05.600]   Number one, it's bad for the Pentagon.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.600]   It gives them substandard equipment.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:13.400]   It rewards very old weapon systems and programs and thinking that can be easily defeated by
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.360]   people who are studying that for vulnerabilities.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.920]   The perfect example is all of this drone warfare in Ukraine and in Russia.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:27.040]   I mean, drone warfare costs almost nothing, and yet drone swarms and hypersonic missiles
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:34.000]   pose huge dangers to U.S. systems, which cost more than hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.160]   So my point is that giving nimble procurement and systemic change in the way that we think
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.000]   about executing the mission that Congress does give you actually could save the most
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.040]   amount of money in the long run.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.660]   That's where I would really focus in on.
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:54.240]   The other one is, you know, counter to everything I just said, is maybe they listen.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.520]   Maybe the Republicans are like, yeah, okay, let's do it.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:02.440]   The problem again, though, is swing state people who need to get reelected, they need
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.440]   to do one thing.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.840]   They need to deliver for their district, they need to run on stuff.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.280]   And nobody has ever run on cutting money for your state.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.160]   They have run on bringing money to your state.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:17.700]   And that's why earmarks and a lot of these other things are extraordinarily popular in
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:22.120]   Congress is because it's such an easy way to show constituents how you're working for
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:25.560]   them whenever it does come re-election time.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.240]   So it's a very difficult system.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:32.800]   And I also want to tell people who are frustrated by this, I share your frustration, but the
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.920]   system is designed to work this way.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:40.360]   And for two centuries, the Senate has stood as a bulwark against literally every popular
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.360]   change.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:46.000]   And because of that, it's designed to make sure that it's so popular for long enough
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.360]   that it has to become inevitable before the status quo can change.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:52.600]   That's really, really frustrating, but you should take comfort in that it's always been
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.600]   that way.
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.880]   So it's been okay.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:01.560]   Well, as I've learned from one of the recommendations of the age of acrimony, I feel embarrassed
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.360]   that I didn't know that senators used to not be elected.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:05.360]   What a crazy system.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.360]   Huh?
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:14.480]   I mean, many of the things we take for granted now as defining our democracy was kind of
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:20.240]   invented developed after the civil war in the sort of 50 years after the civil war.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.240]   Absolutely correct.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240]   Age of acrimony.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.240]   Oh my God.
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.240]   I love that book.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:25.240]   I cannot recommend it enough.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.400]   It is so important.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:31.080]   And one of the biggest mistakes that Americans make is that we study periods where greatness
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.440]   happened, but we don't often study periods where nothing happened or where really bad
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.440]   shit happened.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.080]   You know, we don't spend nearly enough.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.080]   Americans know about FDR.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:43.560]   They don't really know anything about the depression or how we got there.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:48.000]   What was it like to be alive in the United States in 1840, right?
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.600]   Nobody thinks about that, really, because it's kind of an in-between time in history.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.680]   There are people who lived their entire lives, who were born, who had to live through those
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:59.120]   times, who were just as conscientious and intelligent as you and I are, and we're just
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.820]   trying to figure shit out and things felt really big.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:06.000]   So the age of acrimony is a time where it's almost completely ignored outside of the Gilded
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   Age aspect.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.480]   But like you just said, it was a time where progressive reform of government and of the
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:19.040]   tension between civil rights, extraordinary wealth, and democracy, and really the reigning
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:24.520]   in of big business, so many of our foundations happened exactly in that time.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.960]   And I take a lot of comfort from that book because one of the things I learned from the
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:33.120]   book is that voter participation is highest when people are pissed off, not when they're
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120]   happy.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:38.040]   And that's such a counterintuitive thing, but voter participation goes down when the
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.040]   system is working.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.680]   So 2020, right, I think we can all agree it was a very tense election.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:49.080]   That's also why it had the highest voter participation ever, 2024, very high rates of participation.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.600]   Same thing, people are pissed off, and that's actually what drives them to the vote.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.880]   But something that I take comfort in that is that people being pissed off and people
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:00.400]   going out to vote, it actually does have major impact on the system, because otherwise the
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.640]   status quo is basically allowed to continue.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.160]   And so, yeah, like you just said, I mean, direct election of senators wasn't...
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:12.360]   I mean, there are probably people alive today who were born when there was no direct election
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.000]   of senators, which is an insane thing to think about.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.960]   I mean, there'd be almost 100 or so.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:22.760]   But the point is, is that at that time, it was so deeply corrupt, and it was one where
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:27.880]   the quasi-aristocracy from the early days leading into the Gilded Age were able to enforce
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.480]   their will upon the people.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:33.760]   But you can take comfort in that that was one of those areas where Americans were so
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.360]   fed up with it, they changed the constitution and actually forced the aristocrats in power
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.960]   to give their own power.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   It's like our version of when they flipped power and took away the legislative power
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.680]   of the House of Lords in the UK.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.720]   I just think that's amazing, and it's such a cool thing about our country and the UK
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:51.720]   too.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:57.440]   It's a continued battle between the people and the elite, right?
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:04.040]   And we should mention not just the direct election of senators, but the election of
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.400]   candidates for a party.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.400]   Yes.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.400]   That was also invented.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:14.920]   It used to be that the "party bosses," I say that with a half a chuckle, chose the
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.920]   candidate.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.920]   The whole system is nuts.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.480]   The way that we currently experience politics is such a modern invention.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.040]   There's a little asterisk with Kamala Harris, but-
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.040]   Right.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.040]   Yeah, good point.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.840]   Well, that was actually more of a mean reversion, right?
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.040]   We're living in an extraordinarily new era where we actually have more input than ever
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.440]   on who our candidates are.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.000]   It used to be.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   This is crazy.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.320]   So the conventions have always taken place two months before, right?
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.240]   Imagine a world where you did not know who the nominee was going to be before that convention,
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:47.120]   and the nominee literally was decided at that convention by those party bosses.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:52.360]   Even crazier, there used to be a standard in American politics where presidents did
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.000]   not directly campaign.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000]   They in fact did not even comment about the news or mention their opponents' names.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000]   They would give speeches from their doorstep, but it was unseemly for them to engage in
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.060]   direct politics.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.080]   You would not get a Bernie Sanders.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.080]   No, no.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.360]   You would not get a Donald Trump.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.960]   Obama, Bill Clinton, I mean, basically every president from John F. Kennedy onwards has
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.820]   been a product of the new system.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.600]   Every president prior to that has been much more of the older system.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.240]   There was an in-between period post-FDR where things were really changing, but the primary
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:28.140]   system itself had its first true big win under John F. Kennedy.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:32.200]   I think that the lesson from that is there's a collective wisdom to the people, right?
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.200]   I think so.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.200]   I think it works.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.200]   I mean, well, okay.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.200]   I'll steelman it.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.360]   We had some great presidents in the party boss era.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.360]   FDR was a great president.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.040]   FDR was the master of coalitional politics, of his ability.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.520]   In fact, what really made him a genius was his ability to get this, overthrow the support
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:56.680]   of a lot of the corruption and the elite Democrats to take control in there at the convention
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:03.240]   and then combine his personal popularity to fuse all systems of power where he had the
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.560]   elites basically under his boot because he was the king and he used his popular power
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:13.380]   and his support from the people to be able to enforce things up and down.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:19.360]   I mean, even in the party boss era, we would have no ... A lot of the people we revere
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.320]   really came out of that, people like Abraham Lincoln.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:26.240]   I don't think Abraham Lincoln would have won a party primary in 1860.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.240]   There's no chance.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.240]   He won.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:35.000]   He won, luck, thank God, from an insane process in the 1860 Republican convention.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   People should go read about that because that was wild.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.120]   I think we were this close to not having Lincoln as president.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.680]   Yeah, I mean, Teddy Roosevelt, there's so many that I could point to who made great
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.080]   impacts on history.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.400]   The system does find a way to still produce good stuff.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.240]   That was a kind of beautiful diversion from the Doge discussion, if we can return briefly
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:55.240]   to Doge.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.240]   Sure.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.360]   We kind of talked about cost cutting, but there's also increasing the efficiency of
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.800]   government, which you also kind of talked about with procurement.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:11.460]   Maybe we can throw into the pile the 400 plus federal agencies.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:15.780]   Let's take another perspective on what success might look like.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:21.760]   Radically successful Doge, would it basically cut a lot of federal agencies?
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760]   Probably combine.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760]   Combine.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.600]   Okay, so I can give great examples of this because I have great insight.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.160]   Each agency will often use different payroll systems.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.780]   They'll have different internal processes, right?
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:38.400]   That makes no sense, and it's all because it's antiquated.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:45.040]   Now, everybody always talks about changing it, but there are a lot of party interests
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.740]   about why certain people get certain things.
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:51.880]   The real problem with government, the people like us who are private, and for example,
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.000]   when you want to do something, you can just do it.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.400]   I was listening to a really interesting analysis about law enforcement and the military.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.520]   I think the story was that the military, some National Guard guys were assigned to help
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.240]   with the border, and they were trying to provide, I think it was translation services to people
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.860]   at Border Patrol, but somebody had to come down and be like, "Hey, this has got to stop.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:23.000]   According to U.S. Code X, Y, and Z, the United States military cannot help with law enforcement
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.820]   abilities here."
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:29.240]   Even though that makes absolutely no sense because they're all work, there are literal
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:33.640]   legal statutes in place that prevent you from doing the most efficient thing possible.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:39.560]   For some reason, we have to have a ton of Spanish speakers in South Com, in the U.S.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.920]   command that is responsible for South America, who literally cannot help with a crisis at
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:44.920]   the border.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:50.200]   Now, maybe you can find some legal chicanery to make that work, but man, you got to have
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.520]   an attorney general who knows what he's doing.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:53.800]   You need a White House counsel.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.760]   You need to make sure that shit stands up in a court of law.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.760]   It's not so simple.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:00.720]   Whereas, let's say you have a software right here and you want to get a new software.
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.720]   You can just do it.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.360]   You can hire whoever you want.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:08.200]   When you're the government, there's a whole process you got to go through about bidding.
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:14.880]   It just takes forever and it is so inefficient, but unfortunately, the inefficiency is really
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.480]   derivative of a lot of legal statutes.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:25.560]   That is something that, again, actually radically successful doge, quote unquote, would be study
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:32.240]   the law and then change it, like figure instead of cost cutting, like cut this program or
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.240]   whatever.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:36.200]   Like I just said about why do different systems use payroll?
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:42.280]   Just say that you can change the statute under which new software can be updated.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.200]   Let's say after 90 days, you know, I've heard stories of people who work for the government
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.600]   who still have like IBM mainframe that they're still in 2024, that they're still working
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.480]   because those systems have never been updated.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.080]   There's also a big problem with a lot of this clearance stuff.
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.200]   That's where a lot of inefficiency happens because a lot of contractors can only work
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:02.800]   based upon previous clearance that they already got.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.880]   Achieving a clearance is very expensive.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880]   It's a very lengthy process.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:11.240]   I'm not saying it shouldn't be talking about security clearance, but it does naturally
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:15.080]   create a very small pool that you can draw some contracts from.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:20.280]   And I even mean stuff like the janitor at the Pentagon needs a security service, right?
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.280]   So clearance.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.800]   So there's only like five people who can even apply for that contract.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:30.640]   Well, naturally in an interim monopoly like that, he's going to jack his price up because
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.400]   he literally has a moat around his product.
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.520]   Whereas if you or I are hiring a janitor, whatever, anybody for anything, that type
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.480]   of credentialism and legal regime, it doesn't matter at all.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:44.680]   So there are a million problems like this that people in government run into.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:49.400]   And that is what I would see as the most successful, you know, paperwork slows everything down
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:55.480]   and it feels impossible to break through that in a sort of incremental way.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.480]   It's so hard.
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.800]   It feels like the only way to do it is to literally shut down agencies in some kind
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.220]   of radical way and then build up from scratch.
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:13.160]   Of course, as you highlight, that's going to be opposed by a lot of people within government.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.880]   Well, historically there's only one way to do it and it's a really bad answer.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:17.880]   War.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:24.600]   So I was going to say, basically you have the kind of consensus where, okay, all this
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:29.320]   stupid bureaucratic bullshit we've been doing, we need to like put that shit aside, get the
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.320]   fuck out of here.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.720]   We need to win a war.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.520]   So like all the paperwork, you know, all the lawyers go, go leave.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.520]   Exactly.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.280]   No, but I want people to really understand that, you know, up until 1865 or 1860, I forget
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.320]   the exact year, we didn't even have national currency.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:49.800]   And then we were like, well, we need a greenback.
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:54.600]   And prior to that, people would freak out if we were talking about having national currency,
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:57.800]   greenback backed by the, you know, the US government and all that.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.240]   Not even a question passing like two weeks in the US Congress, an income tax eventually
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.160]   went away, but not even in the realm of possibility.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.340]   And they decided to pass it.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:09.360]   Same thing after World War I.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.520]   And you think about how World War II, I mean, World War II just fundamentally changed the
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.600]   entire way the United States government works.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.560]   Even the DHS, which I mentioned earlier, the Department of Homeland Security, it didn't
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.520]   even exist prior to 9/11.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.780]   It was done as response to 9/11 to coalesce all of those agencies under one branch to
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:31.560]   make sure that nothing like that could ever happen again.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:38.180]   And so historically, unfortunately, absolute shitshow disaster war is the only thing that
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:41.600]   moves and throws the paperwork off the table.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:47.120]   And I wish I wasn't such a downer, but I've just, I've read too much and I've had enough
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:52.940]   experience now in Washington to just see how these dreams get crushed instantly.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.640]   And I wish it wasn't that way.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.960]   I mean, it's a cool idea and I want people who are inspired, who are getting into politics
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.200]   to think that they can do something, but I want them to be realistic too.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.080]   And I want them to know what they're signing up for whenever they do something like that.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.240]   And the titanic amount of work it is going to take for you to be able to accomplish something.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.040]   Yeah, but I've also heard a lot of people in Silicon Valley laughing when Elon rolled
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.840]   in and fired 90% of Twitter.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:16.840]   Here's this guy, Elon Musk.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:18.600]   You are absolutely correct.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.380]   Knows nothing about running a social media company.
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:22.800]   Of course you need all these servers.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.960]   Of course you need all these employees.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.360]   And nevertheless, the service keeps running.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.360]   He figured it out and you have to give him eternal credit for that.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.760]   I guess the difference is there was no law that he could fire them.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:38.400]   There was no, like at the end of the day, he owned the company.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.040]   He had total discretion of his ability to move.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.840]   So I'm not even saying his ideas are bad.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:49.240]   I'm saying that the ability that's, what makes him such an incredible visionary entrepreneur?
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:55.740]   It's movement, it's deference at times to the right people, but also the knowledge of
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:44:00.560]   every individual piece of the machine and his ability to come in and to execute his
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.440]   full vision at any time and override any of the managers.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.400]   So I talked previously about the professional managerial class and the managerial revolution.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:12.800]   Elon is one of the few people who's ever built a multibillion dollar company who has not
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.920]   actually fallen victim to the managerial revolution and against entrepreneurship and innovation
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.960]   that happens there.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.560]   There are very few people who can do it.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.000]   Elon, Steve Jobs.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.880]   But you know, what do we learn is that unfortunately after Steve died, Apple basically did succumb
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:31.360]   to the managerial revolution and has become like the product, you know, they make all
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.520]   their money by printing services and making it impossible to leave this ecosystem as opposed
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.600]   to building the most cool product ever.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.680]   As much as I love my Vision Pro, don't get me wrong.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.760]   I think you just admitted that you're part of a cult.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.320]   I know, I literally am.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.320]   I am.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.320]   I fully admit it.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.320]   I miss Steve.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.320]   The grass is green on the other side.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:52.320]   Come join us.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.320]   Okay.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:59.880]   So Elon or somebody else, what gives you hope about something like a radical transformation
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:05.160]   of government towards efficiency, towards being more slim?
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:06.800]   What gives you hope that that will be possible?
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.560]   Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.600]   I don't think slimness in and of itself is a good thing.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.360]   What I care about is the relationship to people in its government.
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:19.600]   So the biggest problem that we have is that we have a complete loss of faith in all of
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.460]   our institutions.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:27.520]   And I really encourage people, I don't think people can quite understand what the relationship
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:32.480]   between America and its government was like after World War II and after FDR.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:35.560]   Like 90% of the people trusted the government.
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.920]   That's crazy.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:41.200]   Like when the president said something, they were like, "Okay, he's not lying."
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.540]   Think about our cynical attitude towards politicians today.
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:49.400]   That is largely the fault of Lyndon Johnson and of Richard Nixon and that entire fallout
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.240]   period of Vietnam.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:55.400]   Vietnam in particular really broke the American character and its ability and its relationship
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.400]   with government.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.640]   And we've never recovered faith in institutions ever since that.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.700]   And it's really unfortunate.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:06.440]   So what makes me hopeful, at least this time, is anytime a president wins a popular vote
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:11.600]   and an election is they have the ability to reset and to actually try and build something
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.980]   that is new.
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:19.360]   And so what I would hope is that this is different from the first Trump administration in which
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.960]   the mandate for Donald Trump is actually carried out competently.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.840]   Yes, he can do his antics, which got him elected.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.240]   At this point, we can't deny it.
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.240]   McDonald's thing is hilarious.
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.240]   It's funny.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.240]   It is.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.360]   People love it.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.740]   People like the podcasting.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:35.740]   People like-
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:36.740]   Garbage truck.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.740]   The garbage truck.
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:41.880]   They like the stunts and he will always excel and he will continue to do that.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.720]   There are policy and other things that he can and should do like the pursuit of no war,
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:52.160]   like solving the immigration question and also really figuring out our economy the way
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:59.560]   that it currently runs and changing it so that the actual American dream is more achievable.
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:03.320]   And housing is one of the chief problems that we have right now.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:06.520]   The real thing is Donald Trump was elected on the backs of the working man.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.280]   I mean, it's just true.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.640]   Households under $100,000 voted for Donald Trump.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.040]   Maybe they didn't do so for economic reasons.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.320]   I think a lot of them did for economic, but a lot of them did for immigration, for cultural,
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.260]   but you still owe them something and there is a, I would hope that they could carry something
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:26.800]   out in that respect that is not a similar continuation and chaotic vibe of the first
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:33.000]   time where everything felt like it exploded any time with staffing, with even his policy
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.040]   or what he cared about or his ability to pursue.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.680]   And a lot of that does come back to personnel.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.440]   So I'm concerned in some respects, I'm like, you know, not thrilled in some respects, I'm
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.800]   happy in some respects, but it remains to be seen how he's going to do it.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:51.680]   To the degree it's possible to see Trumpism and MAGA as a coherent ideology, what do you
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.600]   think are the central pillars of it?
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.120]   MAGA is a rejection of cultural elitism.
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:47:59.340]   That's what I would say.
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:04.200]   Cultural elitism though has many different categories.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.260]   Immigration is one, right?
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:09.960]   Is that cultural elitism and cultural liberalism has a fundamental belief that immigration
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:14.400]   in and of itself is a natural good at any and all levels, that all immigrants are like
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.920]   replacement level, that there is no difference between them.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:24.840]   Cultural elitism in a foreign policy context comes back to a lot of that human rights democracy
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:29.520]   stuff that I was talking about earlier, which divorces American values from American interests
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.960]   and says that actually American values are American interests.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:39.160]   Cultural elitism and liberalism leads to the worship of the postal rights era of bureaucracy
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:44.840]   that I talked about from those two books of DEI, quote unquote woke, and of progressive
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.040]   social ideology.
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:51.920]   So I would put all those together as ultimately what MAGA is.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.760]   It is a screw you.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:59.680]   I once drove past, it was in rural Nevada and I was driving, and I drove past the biggest
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.120]   sign I've ever seen, political sign to this day, and it was in 2020, it just said, "Trump,
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.800]   fuck your feelings."
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.880]   And I still believe that is the most coherent MAGA thing I've ever seen because everyone's
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:18.680]   always like, "How can a neocon and Tulsi Gabbard and RFK and all these other people, how can
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.280]   they all exist under the same umbrella?"
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.000]   And I'm like, "It's very simple.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.200]   All of them have rejected the cultural elite in their own way, certainly, but they've arrived
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:29.640]   at the same place.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:35.320]   It's an umbrella, and it's an umbrella fundamentally, which has nothing to do with the status quo
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:39.260]   and with the currently established cultural elite."
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:41.840]   That doesn't mean they're not elite and they're not rich in their own regards, that doesn't
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.680]   mean they don't disagree, but that's the one thing that unites the entire party.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:48.080]   And so that's the way I would put it.
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:52.000]   - Anti-cultural elite, is that synonymous with anti-establishment?
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.600]   So basic distrust of all institutions?
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.840]   Is elitism connected to institutions?
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:01.100]   - Yes, absolutely, because elites are the ones who runs our institutions.
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:04.960]   That said, anti-establishment is really not the right word because there are a lot of
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.520]   left-wingers who are anti-establishment, right?
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.240]   They are against that, but they're not anti-cultural leftism.
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.720]   And that's the key distinction between MAGA and left populism.
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.440]   Left populism basically does agree.
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:23.360]   They agree with basic conceits like racism is one of the biggest problem facing America.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:27.700]   They're like, "One of the ways that we would fix that is through class-oriented economic
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.760]   programs in order to address that."
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.760]   But we believe in, I don't know, like reparations as a concept, it's just more about how we
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:36.280]   arrive there.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.000]   Whereas in MAGA, we would say, "No, we actually don't think that at all, we think we've evolved
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.880]   past that, and we think that the best way to fix it is actually similar policy prescription,
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:47.300]   but the mindset matters a lot."
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:53.020]   So the real distinction between MAGA and like left populism really is on culture.
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:58.420]   Trans in particular, orientation about, actually, immigration may be the biggest one.
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:03.160]   Because if you look at the history of Bernie Sanders, Bernie Sanders was a person who railed
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.960]   against open borders and against mass migration for years.
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:12.200]   There are famous interviews of him on YouTube with Lou Dobbs, who's one of the hardcore
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.820]   immigration guys, and they agree with each other, and Lou is like, "Bernie's one of the
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:17.460]   only guys out there."
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:22.480]   Bernie, at the end of the day, he had to succumb to the cultural left and its changing attitudes
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.520]   on mass immigration.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:29.260]   There are some famous clips from 2015 in a Vox interview that he gave where he started,
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:34.700]   I think he started talking about how the open borders is a Koch brothers libertarian concept.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:38.900]   Because Bernie is basically of a European welfare state tradition.
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:42.120]   European welfare states are very simply understood.
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:45.900]   We have high taxes, high services, low rates of immigration.
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:50.320]   Because we have high taxes and high services, we have a limited pool of people who can experience
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.840]   and take those services.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.260]   He used to understand that.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.600]   He changed a lot of his attitude.
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:59.860]   Bernie also, I will say, look, he's a courageous man and a courageous politician.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:04.900]   As late as 2017, he actually endorsed a pro-life candidate, because he said that that pro-life
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:09.080]   candidate was pro-worker, and he's like, "At the end of the day, I care about pro-worker
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:10.080]   policy."
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:12.320]   And he's done a ton of shit for it, and I don't think he's done it since.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:19.120]   So the sad part that's really happened is that a lot of left populist agenda and other
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:25.560]   has become subsumed in the hysteria around cultural leftism, wokeism, whatever the hell
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.920]   you want to call it.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:31.560]   And that ultimately, that cultural leftism was the thing that really united the two wings
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.560]   of that party.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:35.680]   And that's really why MAGA is very opposed to that.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.680]   They're really not the same.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:39.560]   But the left populist can still be anti-establishment.
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:40.560]   That's the key.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:48.200]   It's interesting to think of the left cultural elite subsuming, consuming Bernie Sanders,
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.200]   the left populist.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.200]   So you think that's what happened?
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.200]   That's what I would say.
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.320]   What do you think happened in 2016 with Bernie?
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.100]   Is there a possible future where he would have won?
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:00.840]   You and Crystal wrote a book on populism in 2020.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:07.520]   So from that perspective, just looking at 2016, if he rejected wokeism at that time,
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.440]   by the way, that would be pretty gangster during 2016.
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:17.280]   Would he have, because I think Hillary went towards the left more, right?
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:18.280]   Am I remembering that correctly?
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:19.280]   Kind of.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.280]   It was a very weird time.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.080]   So yes and no.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:28.640]   It wasn't full on BLM mania like it was in 2020, but the signs were all there.
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.760]   So the great awokening was in 2014.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.040]   I know it's a ridiculous term.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.040]   I love it.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.040]   Please keep saying it.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.040]   There's a ring to it.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.440]   The great awakening is about the great religious revival in the United States.
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:44.640]   So people had, because wokeism is a religion, that's a common refrain.
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:46.880]   They were like the great awokening is a really good term.
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:48.120]   Thank you for explaining the joke.
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.600]   So the great awokening is basically when racial attitudes amongst college educated whites
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.440]   basically flipped on its head.
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:58.160]   There are a variety of reasons why this happened.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:02.160]   I really believe that Ta-Nehisi Coates' case for reparations in the Atlantic is one of
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.160]   those.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:08.720]   It radicalized an entire generation of basically like white college educated women to think
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.160]   completely differently on race.
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:15.320]   It was during Ferguson and then it also happened immediately after the Trayvon Martin case.
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:21.560]   Those two things really set the stage for the eventual BLM takeover of 2020.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.360]   But fundamentally what they did is they changed racial attitudes amongst college educated
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:28.900]   elites to really think in a race first construct.
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:34.480]   And worse is that they were rejected in 2016 at the ballot box by the election of Donald
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.520]   Trump and in response they ramped it up because they believed that that was the framework
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:43.920]   to view the world, that people voted for Trump because he was racist and not for a variety
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:46.000]   of other reasons that they eventually did.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:52.040]   And so the point around this on question of whether Bernie could have won in 2016, I don't
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:53.040]   know.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.200]   Crystal seems to think so.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:56.200]   I'm skeptical.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.500]   I'm skeptical for a variety of reasons.
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:00.900]   I think the culture is honestly one of them.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:07.080]   One of Trump's core issues in 2016 was immigration and Bernie and him did not agree on immigration.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:12.200]   And if immigration, even if people did support Bernie Sanders and his vision for working
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:17.080]   class people, like the debates and the understanding about what it would look like, like a healthcare
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.720]   system which literally would pay for illegal immigrants, I think he would have gotten killed
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:22.800]   on that.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:23.800]   But I could be wrong.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.160]   I honestly, I will never know what that looked like.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.880]   Let me reference you from earlier in the conversation with FDR.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.760]   It's not the policy.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:39.320]   I think if he went more anti-establishment and more populist as opposed to trying to
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.560]   court, trying to be friendly with the DNC.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.720]   I mean, that's a good counterfactual.
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.480]   Nobody will really know.
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:50.880]   Look, I have a lot of love for the Bernie 2016 campaign.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.880]   He has a great ad from 2016 called America.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.880]   You should watch it.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:55.880]   It's a great ad.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:58.920]   Another very interesting thing, it's unapologetically patriotic.
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:03.120]   And that is not something that you see in a lot of left-wing circles these days.
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.320]   So he understood politics at a base level that a lot of people did not.
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:13.520]   But Bernie himself, and then a lot of the Bernie movement was basically crushed by the
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.340]   elite democratic party for a variety of reasons.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:17.340]   They hated them.
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:22.440]   They basically, they attacked Joe Rogan for even having him on and for giving him a platform
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:23.440]   that was ridiculous.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.800]   It obviously backfired in their face, which is really funny.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:30.720]   But there are a lot of million examples like that.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.280]   When they attacked Bernie for endorsing a pro-life politician and he never did it again.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:40.660]   They attacked Bernie for having Bernie bros, people online, the bros who were super bro
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:41.660]   Bernie.
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:42.660]   And it was his fault.
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:47.240]   His supporters would say nasty things about Elizabeth Warren and he would defend straight
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:49.160]   himself and be like, "Yes, I'm sorry.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:50.160]   Please.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.160]   My bro."
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.160]   It was like, "Stop that."
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:55.200]   His biggest problem is he never went full Trump.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.280]   He didn't go, he kept saying, "Sorry."
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.280]   I agree.
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.280]   I totally agree.
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.600]   And actually in 2020, I did a ton of analysis on this at the time.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:06.360]   He would always do stuff like, "Joe Biden, my friend."
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.440]   And it's like, "No, he's not your friend.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.880]   He stands for everything that you disagree with.
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:11.880]   Everything."
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.120]   He'd be like, "Yeah, he's a nice guy, but he's not my friend."
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.660]   But he would always be like, "Joe and I are great friends, but we have a small disagreement
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:20.660]   on this."
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:24.660]   And like you just said, in terms of going full Trump, they wanted to see Trump up there
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:28.640]   humiliating all of the GOP politicians that they didn't trust anymore.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.080]   That's what people really wanted.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:35.920]   But the other side of this is that the Democratic base in 2020 was very different than 2016
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:39.080]   because by 2020, they full on had TDS.
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:44.240]   And they were basically like, "We need to defeat Trump at all costs.
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:46.560]   We don't give a shit what your name is.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.880]   Bernie, Biden, whatever.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:52.760]   Whichever of you is going to best defeat Trump, you get the nom."
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:59.120]   2016 is different because they didn't full on have that love and necessity of winning.
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.960]   By the way, this is a strategic advantage that the Democrats have.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:05.840]   Democrats just care about winning, the current base of the party.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.300]   All they want to do is win.
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:08.760]   Republican base, they don't give a shit about winning.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.760]   They just love Trump.
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:17.000]   So it's nice to win, but one of those where they will express their id for what they really
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000]   want.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.280]   It's nice for them because it turns out that's a very palpable political force.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:27.280]   But one of the reasons why you won't see me up here doing James Carville 40 more years
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:34.200]   is there's a law of something called thermostatic public opinion where the thermostat, it changes
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.200]   a lot.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:38.800]   So when you have a left-wing president in power, the country goes right.
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:41.880]   When you have a right-wing president in power, the country goes left.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:42.880]   Amazing, right?
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:48.320]   You can actually look at a graph of economic attitudes from the two months where Joe Biden
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:50.240]   became president after Donald Trump.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:53.160]   So Republicans, Trump was president in the last year in office.
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.160]   Economy's great.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.160]   Two months later, the economy is horrible.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:00.000]   That is a perfect example of thermostatic opinion.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.080]   And I'm not counting these Democrats out.
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:05.240]   2004, George W. Bush wins the popular vote.
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:07.960]   He has a historic mandate to continue in Iraq.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:09.360]   By '06, he's toasted.
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:13.960]   We have a massive midterm election, and by '08, we're writing books about 40 more years
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:16.800]   and how there's never going to be a Republican in office ever again.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:19.360]   So things can change a lot in a very short period of time.
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:25.040]   I think also for me personally, maybe I'm deluded, sort of the great man view of history.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.480]   I think some of it is in the programming circles, the term skills issue.
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:34.400]   I think some of it just has to do how good you are, how charismatic you are, how good
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.840]   you are as a politician.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.960]   I, maybe you disagree with this, I'd love to see what you think.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:43.560]   I think if Obama, if you were allowed to run for many terms, I think Obama would just keep
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:44.560]   winning.
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:49.160]   He would win 2016, he would win 2020, he would win this year, 2024.
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:52.720]   It's possible, but I would flip it on you and I would say Obama would never be elected
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:55.960]   if there were no term limits, because Bill Clinton would have still been president.
[01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:56.960]   Right.
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:57.960 --> 01:59:58.960]   Well, those two, right.
[01:59:58.960 --> 01:59:59.960]   That's two examples of, exactly.
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:07.160]   They extremely skilled politicians and somehow can appear like populists.
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:13.240]   Man, Bill Clinton was a force in his time and it's honestly sad what's happened to him.
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:16.480]   I was actually just talking with a friend the other day, I'm like, I kind of don't think
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:21.400]   the president should become president when they're young because they live to see themselves
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.800]   become irrelevant.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:27.560]   And that must be really painful because I know what it takes to get there.
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:28.560]   Imagine being Clinton.
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:33.380]   I mean, your entire legacy was destroyed with Hillary Clinton in 2016.
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:38.500]   And then imagine being Obama, who in 2016, you could argue it's a one-off and say that
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:41.120]   Trump is just, oh, Hillary was a bad candidate.
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:46.260]   But Michelle and Barack Obama went so hard for Kamala Harris and they just got blown
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:47.260]   out in the popular vote.
[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:51.540]   I mean, the Obama era officially ended with Donald Trump's reelection to the presidency
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:52.840]   in 2024.
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:56.960]   And that was a 20 year period where Obama was one of the most popular central figures
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.820]   in American politics.
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:01.600]   But I want to return to what you're saying because it is important.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:04.740]   And by the way, I do not support term limits on American presidents.
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:05.740]   Are you a fascist?
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:09.500]   Well, that would imply that I don't believe in democracy.
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:13.900]   I actually do believe in democracy because I think the people, if they love their president,
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.220]   should be able to reelect him.
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:17.020]   I think FDR was amazing.
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:23.940]   I think that the term limit change was a basically what happened is that Republicans and a lot
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:29.400]   of elite Democrats always wanted to speak against FDR, but he was a god, so they couldn't.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.200]   So they waited until he died.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.700]   And then after he died, they were like, yeah, this whole third, fourth term that can never
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:35.860]   happen again.
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:38.660]   And America didn't really think that hard about it.
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:40.500]   They were like, yeah, OK, whatever.
[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:44.780]   But I mean, it had immense consequences for American history.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.380]   Clinton is the perfect example.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:51.660]   I mean, just Bill Clinton left office, even despite the Lewinsky bullshit, he has 60 percent
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:53.460]   approval rating, OK?
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:56.180]   No way George W. Bush gets elected.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:57.180]   Impossible.
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:01:58.900]   Clinton would have blown his ass out.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:00.920]   And imagine the consequences of that.
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:01.920]   We would have no Iraq.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:04.760]   I mean, I'm not saying he was a great man.
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:08.140]   We probably still would have the financial crisis, and there's still a lot of bad stuff
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:09.140]   that would have happened.
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:10.140]   But he was a popular dude.
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:16.380]   And I wouldn't say he had the best judgment at times, presidentially, definitely not personally,
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:17.700]   but presidentially.
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:21.460]   But I'm pretty confident we would have not gone into the Iraq War.
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:23.500]   And so that's where it really cost us.
[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:26.780]   If you're left wing and you're talking about Obama, yeah, I think Obama probably would
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:28.660]   have won in 2016.
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:35.540]   Although it's counterfactual, because Obama was never challenged in the same way that
[02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:38.900]   MAGA was able to, to the liberal consensus.
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:43.900]   Like Romney really ran this awful campaign, honestly, about cutting spending.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:47.040]   It was very traditional, Republican, it was deeply unpopular.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:52.140]   The autopsy of that election was we actually need to be more pro-immigration.
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:54.300]   That literally was the autopsy.
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:57.020]   But Trump understood the assignment.
[02:02:57.020 --> 02:03:02.120]   There are two people who I so deeply respect for their political bets, Peter Thiel and
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:03.200]   Donald Trump.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.420]   So one of the books that I recommended called The Unwinding by George Packer, he actually
[02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:08.780]   talks about Peter Thiel there.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:10.740]   This is in 2013.
[02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:16.320]   And Thiel talks about, he was like, "You know, whoever runs for office next, they don't need
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.480]   to run on an optimistic message.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.260]   They need to run on a message that everything is fucked up and that we need to fix."
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:28.740]   And if you think about, that's why Thiel's endorsement of Trump with the American Carnage
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:33.300]   message is, I mean, it took, it was shocking, right, at the time.
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:36.940]   But he had that fundamental insight that that's what the American people wanted.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:42.700]   Trump too comes out of an election in 2012 where the literal GOP autopsy, the report
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:46.460]   produced by the party, says we need to be pro-mass immigration.
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:47.460]   What happens?
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:52.340]   Immediately after 2012, they start to go for mass immigration.
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:57.460]   Basically they go for like these amnesty plans, the so-called Gang of Eight plan, Marco Rubio,
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:03:58.860]   and all of this in 2013.
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:03:59.940]   It falls apart.
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:05.160]   But Republicans get punished by their base in 2014.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:09.700]   So Eric Cantor, who was the House majority leader, the number two Republican, spent more
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:13.700]   on stake in his campaign than his primary opponent who successfully defeated him, a
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:14.700]   guy named Dave Brat.
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:19.780]   Dave Brat kicked his ass on the issue of immigration and said that Eric Cantor is pro-amnesty.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.320]   All of the forces were there.
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:26.340]   And then in 2015, Trump comes down the escalator and he gives the message on immigration that
[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:30.700]   the GOP base has been roaring and wanting to hear now, but that nobody wanted to listen
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:31.700]   to them.
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:33.940]   And that was his fundamental insight.
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:40.620]   That bet was a colossal and a titanic political bet at a time when all political ideology
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:43.900]   and thought process would have said that you should come out on the other side, which is
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:49.320]   where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and all these other guys were effectively there in varying
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.320]   different ways.
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:56.460]   They were hawkish or whatever, but Trump had such a monopoly on that as an idea.
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:58.740]   That's why he wins the 2016 primary.
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:03.860]   And then paired with immigration, a hardline position on immigration, is this American
[02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:06.580]   carnage idea that actually everything is wrong.
[02:05:06.580 --> 02:05:09.820]   The American dream is gone.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:12.420]   We will stop this American carnage.
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:16.380]   And I think American carnage is one of the most important inaugural speeches ever given
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:17.740]   in American history.
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:21.060]   It's put it up against every single other speech.
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:25.580]   There's nothing else like it, but that was what the country wanted at the time.
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:29.860]   And that's what great politicians are able to do, is they're able to suss something out.
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:34.580]   That's also why Peter Thiel is who he is, because he saw that in 2000.
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:40.580]   Imagine what it takes to come out of the 2012 election and to be honestly totally contrarian
[02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:45.700]   to the entire national mood and this entire theory of Obama-esque star politics and say,
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:48.900]   "No, you need somebody who runs on the opposite of that to win."
[02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:50.340]   Well, we'll never know.
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:53.380]   And I love this kind of Mike Tyson versus Muhammad Ali.
[02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:56.740]   I still think I would have loved to see Obama versus Trump.
[02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:57.740]   Me too.
[02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:58.740]   I agree.
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:03.260]   And first of all, Obama versus Trump in 2008, Obama wins hands down.
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:04.940]   Well, yes, definitely.
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:07.700]   I love how this is a boxing talk.
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:14.300]   Now when 2016, Obama has a bunch of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:15.300]   He's vulnerable though.
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:16.300]   I'll tell you why.
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:17.300]   DACA.
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:18.820]   That's what nobody ever talks about in the Obama-Trump thing.
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:24.860]   Don't forget, Obama takes his 2012 victory, basically says, "Oh, the GOP even now agrees
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:30.020]   with me on immigration," and then he does DACA and he legalizes X million and a number
[02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:33.940]   of illegal immigrants who are brought here as children.
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:38.500]   That also fundamentally changed the immigration consensus on the Republican side because they
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:39.940]   were like, "Wait, holy shit.
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:41.300]   You can just do that?
[02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:43.220]   Because we don't agree with that at all."
[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:44.980]   And that really ignited the base as well.
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:46.620]   So I'm not sure.
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:51.740]   I mean, a moment I think about a lot with Trump and just like being able to unleash
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:56.740]   the rage of the Republican base is in the 2012 debate, Kandi Crowley was the moderator
[02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:59.700]   with Mitt Romney and she fact-checked him famously.
[02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:02.700]   This was when fact-checking was shocking in a presidential debate.
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:07.380]   And she said something about Benghazi and she was like, "No, he did say that."
[02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:10.100]   She corrected Romney on behalf of Obama.
[02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:13.620]   To this day, it's questionable whether she was even right.
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:15.300]   And Romney was just like, "Oh, he did?
[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:16.300]   Okay."
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:17.300]   Trump would have been like, "Excuse me?
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:18.300]   Excuse me?"
[02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:21.220]   Be like, "Look at this woman," he would have gone off.
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:27.020]   And I think about that moment because that's what the Republican base wanted to hear, but
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:31.700]   also it turns out America had a lot of festering feelings about the mainstream media that it
[02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:33.540]   needed unleashed.
[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:39.300]   And Trump was just this incredible vector to just blow up this system, which, I mean,
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:41.860]   if you asked me about optimism, that's the thing I'm most optimistic about.
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:46.100]   >>COREY: Yeah, but don't you think Obama had a good sense in how to turn it on, how to
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:47.460]   be anti-establishment correctly?
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:50.300]   >>STEVE: I will not deny that he's one of the most talented politicians literally to
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:51.900]   ever play the game.
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:55.260]   And he is, I mean, just unbelievable rhetorical talent.
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:58.380]   Look, as a counterfactual, would he have been more talented than Hillary?
[02:07:58.380 --> 02:07:59.380]   Yeah.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:00.380]   Okay.
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:01.380]   No question.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:03.700]   I think anybody would have been for that one.
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:08.980]   But at the same time, all the signs were there, all the signs for the Trump victory and for
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:14.980]   the backlash against Obamaism as a political project, it all existed.
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:19.940]   Like I just laid the tea leaves out there, from 2012 to 2015, in retrospect, it's the
[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:23.420]   most predictable thing in the world that Donald Trump will get elected, but it was crazy in
[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:24.420]   the moment.
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:26.540]   I got to live through that, which was really fun, professionally.
[02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:33.100]   >>COREY: I think it's unfortunate that he kind of let Kamala Harris borrow his reputation.
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:38.060]   >>STEVE: Oh, I mean, it's like, you know better, dude, you know.
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:42.700]   You defeated these people, this Clinton machine, you destroyed them.
[02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:44.300]   And it was awesome in '08.
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:45.300]   >>COREY: What is that?
[02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:50.620]   Why do you, why did he, like, he's so much bigger and better than the machine.
[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:51.620]   >>STEVE: I don't get it.
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:52.620]   >>COREY: It's interesting, right?
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:53.620]   >>STEVE: It's so weird though.
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:54.620]   I just think-
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:55.620]   >>COREY: I think this was a wake up call.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:56.620]   >>STEVE: Yeah.
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:08:57.620]   >>COREY: 2024 was a wake up call.
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:08:58.940]   The DNC machine doesn't work.
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:08:59.940]   >>STEVE: Absolutely.
[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:00.940]   I mean-
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:03.380]   >>COREY: There needs to be new blood, new Obama-like candidates.
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:06.340]   >>STEVE: Well, I'm glad you brought that up, because that's important too, in terms of
[02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:08.820]   the process and the way that things currently stand.
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:15.500]   The DNC actually rigged its entire primary system under Biden, way to the, not to the
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:16.980]   benefit of Obama.
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:20.260]   So for example, you know how they moved away from the Iowa caucuses?
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:25.080]   And they actually moved some other primaries and moved the calendar to reward traditional
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:28.580]   states that vote much more in line with the democratic establishment.
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:32.500]   So the story of Barack Obama is one that not many, actually probably a lot of young people
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:35.100]   today don't even remember how it happened.
[02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.620]   In 2008, Obama was the underdog, right?
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:39.620]   And actually, here's the critical thing.
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:41.740]   Obama was losing with black people.
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:42.740]   Why?
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:46.100]   Black Democrats simply did not believe that white people would vote for a black guy.
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:51.980]   So Barack Obama goes to where this white state, Iowa, all in on the Iowa caucuses and shocks
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:54.860]   the world by winning the Iowa caucuses.
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:59.440]   Overnight, there's a shift in public opinion amongst the black population in South Carolina
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:01.240]   that says, "Oh shit, he actually could win."
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:03.280]   And he comes out and he wins South Carolina.
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:06.440]   And that's basically was near the death knell for the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.960]   The problem is, by moving South Carolina up, and by making it first, along with other more
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:15.200]   pro-establishment friendly places, what do we do?
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:17.580]   We make it so that Barack Obama can never happen again.
[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:23.400]   We make it so that an older, you know, base of Democratic Party voters who listens to
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:28.040]   the elites can never have their assumptions challenged.
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:30.480]   And that's one of the worst things Joe Biden did.
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:32.120]   You know, I talked about his arrogance.
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:35.300]   He was so arrogant, he changed the freaking primary system.
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:37.480]   He was so arrogant, he refused to do a debate.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.100]   I mean, imagine history.
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:45.480]   How lucky are we, honestly, that Joe Biden agreed to do that debate with Donald Trump
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:46.480]   early?
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.880]   And again, that was his arrogance.
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:54.440]   I think we're so lucky for it because if we hadn't gotten, we got to understand as a country
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:59.280]   how cooked he was and how fake everything was behind the scenes, in front of all of
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.280]   our eyes.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.720]   And they tried for three straight years to make sure that that would never happen.
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:08.840]   So I mean, it's still such a crime, honestly, against the American people.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:13.320]   I've been thinking about who I want to talk to for three hours, and that's why I bring
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:21.520]   up Obama because he's probably the number one person on the left I would like to hear
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:26.560]   analyze what happened in this election and what happened to the United States of America
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:29.500]   over the past 20 plus years.
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:31.120]   I can't imagine anybody else.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.040]   Look, if anybody could do it, it'd be you.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:35.040]   But there are layers upon layers with that man.
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.700]   I would love to actually sit with a talk with him, for real.
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:44.140]   I think it's fair to say that we talked about the great man view of history.
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:50.140]   I think you have a psychopath view of history where all great leaders are for sure psychopaths.
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:51.140]   Not for sure.
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:52.140]   There are many who are good people.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:53.140]   Harry Truman.
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:54.140]   You're like some of my best friends.
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:55.140]   Yeah.
[02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:58.380]   Some, I assume, are good people.
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:03.420]   To be fair, though, most of the good ones are accidents like Harry Truman.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:04.420]   He never would've gotten himself elected.
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:05.420]   He was a great dude.
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:07.300]   How do you know he was a great dude?
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:08.300]   David McCullough book.
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:09.300]   I highly recommend it.
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.300]   Everybody should read it.
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:11.660]   Truman loved his wife.
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:12.660]   I think that's really awesome.
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:14.100]   I love when politicians love their wife.
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:15.340]   It's so rare.
[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:17.300]   He adored his wife.
[02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:20.140]   He adored his daughter, spent time with them.
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:22.100]   He made family life a priority.
[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:26.780]   He had really good small town judgment that he would apply to foreign affairs.
[02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:32.020]   He was just a very well-considered, very stand-up man.
[02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:34.620]   I so appreciate that about him.
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:35.620]   Another one is John Adams.
[02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:37.020]   I love and revere John Adams.
[02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:38.780]   He is my favorite founding father.
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:42.660]   Him and John Quincy, they don't get nearly enough of their due.
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:46.180]   They were some of the most intelligent, well-considered.
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:49.220]   They were family men.
[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:53.300]   The love, the relationship between John and Abigail Adams is literally legendary.
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:57.660]   I think it's amazing, especially in the context of the 1700s, the way that he would take her
[02:12:57.660 --> 02:13:02.900]   counsel and into conversations and her own ability.
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:06.580]   She would sit there and go toe-to-toe as much with Thomas Jefferson.
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:11.860]   There are some who are great, who are really, really good presidents, who have good judgment,
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:15.620]   and who are really good people and really think deeply about the world and have really
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.260]   cool personal lives.
[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:21.340]   But there's also the vast majority of them, especially in the ... I would say especially
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:27.260]   in the modern era and where the price of the presidency extracts everything that you have.
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:31.620]   You have to be willing to give everything.
[02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:34.100]   That's not a price that most people want to pay.
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:39.420]   Is it possible that some of the people who you think are sociopaths in politics are in
[02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:45.860]   fact really good people, and some of the people you think are good, like Truman and Adams,
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:46.860]   are actually sociopaths?
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:47.860]   Definitely.
[02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:49.660]   I mean, I could just be reading the wrong books, right?
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:50.860]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:55.820]   It sounds like you just read some really compelling biographies.
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:57.700]   To be fair, I don't base this on one book.
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:00.260]   I read a lot of them.
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:02.540]   For example, I've read books about LBJ.
[02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:05.820]   You wouldn't know any of his foibles, but then you find out that they're written by
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:08.820]   his friend or it was written by ... and then you read the truth.
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:16.260]   I really worry about this kind of general, especially now the sense of the anti-establishment
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:20.700]   sense that every politician must be a sociopath.
[02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:27.300]   Now, the reason I worry about that is it feels true.
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:35.500]   You can fall into this bubble of beliefs where every politician is a sociopath, and because
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.500]   of that-
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:37.500]   It can be a self-reinforcing mechanism.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:38.500]   Self-reinforcing mechanism.
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:39.500]   Yeah.
[02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:40.500]   I understand what you're saying.
[02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:41.500]   I agree, by the way.
[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:44.340]   We do need to dramatically change it, but the problem is that people vote with their
[02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:51.340]   eyeballs and with their interests, and people love to dissect people's personal lives.
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:55.020]   One of the reasons why you were probably more likely in the pre-modern era to get a quote
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:59.180]   unquote good people is they were not subject to the level of scrutiny and to the insanity
[02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:01.580]   of the process that you are currently.
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:05.620]   Like I just said about ... I mean, theoretically, you could run for president and you would
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:07.820]   just get your nomination at the convention.
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:09.980]   It's only two months to election day.
[02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:14.500]   That's not so bad, but you run for president today, you've got your ass on the road for
[02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:20.180]   two years, and then two years before that, and then you have to run the damn government.
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:23.020]   The price is so extraordinarily high.
[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:28.180]   I also think that, oh God, and just Washington as a system, it will burn you.
[02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:34.140]   It will extract absolutely everything that you can give it.
[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:38.820]   At the end of the day, I mean, everyone always talks about this, it's hilarious, how Trump
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:41.900]   is the only president not to age in office.
[02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:45.140]   I actually think it's crazy, like when you look at the photos of how he actually looks
[02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:48.260]   better today than he did whenever he went into the office.
[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:52.280]   That's amazing, and it actually says a lot about how his mind works.
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:54.100]   I think Trump is pure id.
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:58.820]   I think he's ... Having observed him a little bit, and both at the White House and having
[02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:03.980]   interviewed him, it's pure just ... It's calculating, but it's also pure id, which is very interesting.
[02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:08.180]   The ones who are the thinkers, guys like Obama and others who are really in their heads,
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:09.180]   it's a nightmare.
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:10.180]   It's a nightmare.
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:14.460]   They will ... I mean, apparently Obama would only sleep four hours a night.
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:18.460]   Yeah, add some empathy on top of that and it's going to destroy you.
[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:20.060]   It will kill you, man.
[02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:24.680]   All right, speaking about the dirty game of politics, several people, different people
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:31.600]   told me that of everyone they've ever met in politics, Nancy Pelosi is the best at attaining
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:33.080]   and wielding political power.
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:34.640]   Is there any truth to that?
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:35.640]   In the modern era?
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:36.640]   Yeah, I think that's fair.
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:37.640]   In the last 25 years?
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:38.640]   Definitely.
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:39.640]   Let's think about it.
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:40.640]   Number one is longevity.
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.440]   She's had the ability to control the caucus for a long period of time, so that's impressive
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:49.320]   because as I just laid out with Clinton, Obama, these figures come and they go, but over
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:55.540]   a 25 almost year period, you've been at the very top and the center of American politics.
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:17:00.160]   The other case I would be is that in this modern era has been defined by access to money.
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:03.200]   She's one of the greatest fundraisers in Democratic Party history.
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:08.200]   And again, consistently, Obama, Kamala, all those people come and go, but she's always
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:14.280]   had a very central understanding of the ability to fundraise, to cultivate good relationships
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:18.280]   with Democratic Party elites all across the country, use that money and dole it out to
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:19.400]   her caucus.
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:24.440]   She's also was really good at making sure that legislation that came to the floor actually
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:26.000]   had the votes to do so.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.480]   She ran an extremely well-ordered process in the House of Representatives, one in which
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.920]   you were able to reconcile problems within her office.
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:38.480]   It didn't usually go public and then it would make it to the floor and it would pass so
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:45.040]   that there will be no general media frenzy and Democrats in disarray or any of that.
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:49.240]   Put that on display with the Republicans and we've had multiple speakers all resign or
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:51.520]   get fired in a 16-year period.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:52.520]   That's pretty remarkable.
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:56.440]   Basically, ever since John Boehner decided to leave in, what was it, 2012?
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:57.640]   I forget the exact year.
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:02.560]   My point is that if you compare her record to the longevity on the Republican side, it
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:03.560]   is astounding.
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:08.840]   The other interesting thing is that she also has pulled off one of the real tests of political
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:12.480]   power is can you rule even when you don't have the title anymore?
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:17.240]   So she gave up the leader position to Hakeem Jeffries, but everybody knows she pulled Joe
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:18.760]   Biden out of the race.
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:20.200]   That's pretty interesting, right?
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:23.920]   So she's technically just a backbencher, nobody member of Congress.
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:25.680]   But we all know that's bullshit.
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:31.440]   So that's actually a very important case of political power is can you rule without the
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:32.440]   title?
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:34.580]   And if you can, then you truly are powerful.
[02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:37.560]   So I would make a good case for her.
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:39.600]   She's done a lot of remarkable stuff for her party.
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:42.240]   I will say they played Trump like a fiddle, man.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:43.960]   Last time around, they were able to.
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.080]   I mean, they really got him.
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:52.520]   One of the craziest elements that I covered was during the Trump basically threatened
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:55.400]   to shut down the government, and actually did shut down the government for a period
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.280]   of time over a dispute over border wall funding.
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:04.000]   And Pelosi and Schumer, despite genuine mass hysteria in the Democratic Party, with even
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:09.600]   some people who were willing to try and to strike a deal, never wavered and actually
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:13.360]   basically won and forced Trump to back down.
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.280]   Not a lot of MAGA people want to admit it, but that was honestly really embarrassing
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:19.920]   for the Trump administration at the time.
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:24.960]   And yeah, I mean, the amount of discipline that it took for her and Chuck to a lesser
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:29.480]   extent, but for the two of them to pull that off, it was honestly impressive that they
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:33.040]   were able to do that, even when the president has so much political power, and it literally
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.000]   shut down the government over it.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.240]   Speaking of fundraising, Kamala raised $1 billion.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:40.240]   Insane.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:44.600]   But I guess the conclusion is she spent it poorly.
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:47.080]   How would you spend it?
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.760]   I don't think money matters that much.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:53.160]   I think Donald Trump has proven to us twice that you can win an underdog campaign through
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:58.680]   earned media, and I don't think that paid advertisement moves the needle that much.
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:04.360]   Don't notice, I didn't say that it doesn't matter, but am I buying $425,000 a day spots
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:05.360]   in the Vegas sphere?
[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:06.360]   No, we're not doing that.
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:07.360]   Are we building...
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:08.360]   I can't...
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:13.760]   Okay, as people who do this for a living, how do you even spend $100,000 to build a
[02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:15.080]   set for one interview?
[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:16.320]   Is this the call her daddy?
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:17.320]   The call her daddy thing.
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:18.320]   Okay.
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:19.320]   How is that possible?
[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:21.200]   So, think about the dollar per hour cost.
[02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:24.120]   That's like running a jet airplane in terms of what they did with the Kamala Harris thing.
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:26.360]   You know what I want to note behind the scenes?
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:27.360]   Yeah.
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:29.480]   I even got, and I'm not good with this.
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:34.600]   I get really frustrated and I shouldn't, but dealing with PR and comms people can sometimes
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:35.680]   break my soul.
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:36.680]   It's maddening.
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:37.680]   Can we not talk about this?
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:42.200]   We need to pull them at 12 p.m. and you're like, "But that's only 30 minutes."
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:47.080]   It's like, yeah, that, but there's stuff like where to put the camera.
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:48.240]   It's not that I don't...
[02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:49.240]   It's not...
[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:54.360]   Actually, hypothetically, I don't even disagree with any of the suggestions, but it's like...
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:55.560]   The micromanagement.
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:21:02.400]   It's the micromanagement and the politeness, but the fake politeness, and it just makes
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:05.960]   me feel like, I think like, "What would Kubrick do?
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:08.360]   Would he murder all of them right now?"
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:13.240]   He would just ban them after he became Stanley Kubrick, but he dealt with it for a while.
[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:17.720]   I just went on a Kubrick binge, man, he was awesome.
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:22.720]   I watched that World War I movie of his, the one from the '50s, that is such an underrated
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:23.720]   film.
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:24.720]   I feel like people don't...
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:25.720]   We'll get past it.
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:26.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:27.720]   Was she...
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:29.320]   Yeah, I guess she paid for...
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:31.120]   A hundred grand, bro.
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:32.120]   A hundred...
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:34.120]   And the Oprah thing?
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:35.120]   She paid for the interviews.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:37.320]   So, you know, that's another one.
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:40.840]   I do this for a living, and as you can tell, I'm a very cynical person.
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:44.160]   I did not even know that celebrities got paid for their endorsements.
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:50.040]   I could never have imagined a universe where Oprah Winfrey has paid $1 million to endorse
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:51.040]   Kamala Harris.
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:53.680]   I'm like, "First of all, you're a billionaire.
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:55.720]   And I thought you'd do this 'cause you believe."
[02:21:55.720 --> 02:22:01.840]   No, I think, to be fair, I think the million just helps do the thing you would like to
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.840]   do.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:05.800]   It's a nudge, 'cause I don't think any celebrity would endorse...
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:10.360]   Yeah, they're not doing it because of the money, but you should just do it for free.
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:14.300]   I can't even believe that you're doing this for money.
[02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:16.200]   And the fact, what was it, Alanis Morissette?
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:17.200]   You know how they were able...
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.840]   They had to cut her because they didn't have the funds to pay her?
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:22.600]   I'm like, "First of all, if you believe, you should just play for free.
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:29.080]   But second, again, as a person who is deeply cynical, I still am genuinely shook that we
[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:30.960]   are paying celebrities for their endorsements."
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:31.960]   Yeah, it's really fucked up.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:32.960]   That's insane.
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:38.760]   Why do you think people on the left who are actually in the political arena are afraid
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:41.400]   of doing anything longer than an hour?
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:42.400]   That's a great question.
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:49.400]   So let me just say, probably most of the people I've talked to on this podcast are left-wing
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:50.600]   or have been for a long time.
[02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:54.400]   They just don't sort of out and say it.
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:23:01.040]   Most scientists are left-wing, most sort of vaguely political people are left-wing that
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:02.840]   I've talked to.
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:10.320]   But the closer you get to the actual political arena, and I've tried really hard, they just...
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:11.320]   Nope.
[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:15.880]   I had a bunch of people, the highest profile people, say 15 minutes, 20 minutes.
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:16.880]   I say, "Nope."
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:17.880]   I'm used to that.
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:18.880]   So welcome.
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:19.880]   Yeah.
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:22.680]   I just can't...
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:33.880]   I can't imagine a conversation with Kamala or with Joe Biden or AOC or Obama that's of
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:40.320]   any quality at all, that shows any kind of humanity of the person, the genius of the
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:45.120]   person, the interesting nuance of the person in 30 minutes.
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:46.120]   I just can't...
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:47.440]   I can't...
[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:52.040]   I don't know, maybe there's people that are extremely skilled that can do that.
[02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:53.040]   You just can't.
[02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:57.320]   You should be optimistic because a huge narrative out of this election is that the Democrats
[02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:00.600]   massively fucked up by not coming on this show or a Rogan show.
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:03.800]   So I actually, fundamentally, number one, that's going to change dramatically.
[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:05.920]   So be optimistic and keep pushing.
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:10.560]   But two is, this is a good segue actually, is I've been thinking a lot about...
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:13.920]   I know a lot of people listening to this show who are in tech and may have some influence
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:19.520]   on the admin, so this is something I want people to take really seriously, is I was
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:22.080]   a White House correspondent for The Daily Caller.
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:25.840]   It's a conservative outlet in Washington during the Trump years.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:32.280]   And the most important thing I learned from that was that under the White House Correspondents
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.880]   Association, the way that the media cartel has everything set up for access for press
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:44.520]   to the president is fundamentally broken, anti-American, and bad for actual democracy.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:48.560]   So let me lay this out at a very mechanical level because nobody knows this.
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:52.040]   And I was a former White House Correspondents Association member, so anybody who says I'm
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:53.720]   full of shit, I was there.
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:57.640]   For example, number one, all the seats in the briefing room, those seats are assigned
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:01.640]   by the White House Correspondents Association, not by the White House itself.
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:06.080]   The White House Correspondents Association requires you to apply for a seat, right?
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:10.960]   That adjudication process can take literally years for bylaws, elections, and all these
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:11.960]   things to do.
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:17.120]   This means that they can slow roll the entrance of new media, online outlets, who are allowed
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:18.120]   into the room.
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:21.280]   The reason it really matters not having a seat is if you don't have a seat, you have
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:25.320]   to get there early and stand in the wings, like I used to, and raise your hand like this,
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.640]   and just hope and pray that the press secretary can...
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:28.640]   It's extremely inconvenient.
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:33.000]   I'm talking, I have to get there hours early at a chance during a 15-minute briefing.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.360]   So one of the things is that Trump has is he owes a huge part of his election to coming
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:40.760]   on podcasts and to new media.
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:45.520]   Now, because of that, it's really important that the White House Correspondents Association,
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:51.440]   which is a literal guild cartel that keeps people out of the White House and credentials
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:57.920]   itself, and creates this opaque mechanism through which they control access to asking
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:00.740]   the press secretary questions, is destroyed.
[02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:05.060]   And there are a lot of different ways you can do this, because what nobody gets to is
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:07.980]   that all of these rules are unofficial.
[02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:10.060]   So for example, they're just traditions.
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:13.020]   The White House is like, "Yeah, it's our building, but you guys figure it out," right?
[02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:15.300]   Because that's a longstanding tradition.
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:19.100]   Let me give you another insane tradition that currently exists in the White House.
[02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:23.960]   The Associated Press, the press secretary or the Associated Press Correspondent gets
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:26.120]   to start the briefing, traditionally.
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:27.180]   They get the first question.
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:28.940]   They also get to end the briefing.
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:32.360]   When they think it's been enough time, they'll be like, "Okay, Corinne Jean-Pierre, thank
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.360]   you," right?
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:34.360]   And that calls the briefing over.
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:35.360]   What?
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:36.360]   Who?
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:37.820]   You're not even in the White House Correspondents Association.
[02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:40.660]   You literally just happen to work for the Associated Press.
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:41.660]   Why?
[02:26:41.660 --> 02:26:43.100]   Like, why do we allow that to happen?
[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:45.740]   So number one, stop doing that.
[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:49.140]   To their credit, the Trump people didn't really do that, but it's a longstanding tradition.
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:54.740]   The other thing is that what nobody gets either is that the first row is all television networks
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:58.300]   for logistical reasons, so that they can do their little stand-ups with their mic and
[02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:00.300]   say, "You know, I'm reporting live for the White House."
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:05.700]   Well, what people don't seem to know is that all the television networks are basically
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:08.440]   going to ask some version of the same question.
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:14.460]   The reason they do that is because they need a clip of their correspondent going after
[02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:18.180]   the White House press secretary all out Robert Mueller, like whenever I was there.
[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:23.840]   So you get the same goddamn version of the stupid political questions over and over again.
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:28.440]   The briefing room is designed for traditional media, and they have all the access in the
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.440]   world.
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:34.600]   So in an election where you owe your victory to, at least in part, to new media and recognizing
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:40.080]   the changing landscape, you need to change the conduit of information to the American
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:41.080]   people.
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:45.880]   And in an election, I don't know if you saw this, but election night coverage on cable
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:50.040]   news was down 25%, just in four years, 25%.
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:51.920]   That's astounding.
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:56.200]   Cable news had a monopoly on election night for my entire lifetime.
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:58.680]   And yet my show had record ratings that night.
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:01.000]   And look, I'm a small slice of the puzzle here.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:06.600]   We've got Candace Owens, Patrick Bette David, Tim Pool, David Pakman, TYT, all these other
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:07.600]   people.
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:11.160]   From what I understand, all of us blew it out that night because millions of Americans
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:12.980]   watched it on YouTube.
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:16.620]   We even partnered with some decision desk HQ, so we had live data.
[02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:20.440]   We could make state calls, and we're just a silly little YouTube show.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:24.560]   My point, though, is that in an election where the vast majority of Americans under the age
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:29.680]   of 55 are listening to podcasts, consuming new media, and are not watching cable news,
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:34.280]   where the median age of CNN, which is the youngest viewership, is 68.
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:35.880]   68 is the median.
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:38.560]   So statistically, what does that tell us?
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:45.640]   There's a decent number of people who are watching CNN who are in their 80s and in their
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:46.640]   90s.
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:51.300]   Yeah, I'm glad you brought up Alex because he deserves a tremendous shout out, Alex Brusewitz.
[02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:56.160]   He was the pioneer of the podcast strategy for the Donald J. Trump campaign.
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.340]   He got on your show.
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:29:00.680]   He was able to get on Andrew Schultz's show, Rogan.
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:04.020]   He was the internal force that pushed a lot of this.
[02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:08.480]   My personal hope is that somebody like Alex is elevated in the traditional White House
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:13.000]   bureaucracy, that the number of credentials that are issued to these mainstream media
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.320]   outlets is cut, and there is a new lottery process put in place where people with large
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:19.040]   audiences are invited.
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:23.560]   And I also want to make a case here for why I think it's really important for people like
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:28.880]   you and others who don't have as much traditional media experience to come in and practice some
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:34.440]   capital J journalism, because it will sharpen you, too, giving you access in that pressure
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:40.000]   cooker environment and having to really sit there and spar a little bit with a public
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.240]   official and not have as long necessarily as you're used to.
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:48.600]   It really hones your news media skills, your news gathering skills, and it will make you
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:50.500]   a better interviewer in the long run.
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:53.160]   Because a lot of the things that I have learned have just been through osmosis.
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:54.720]   I've just lived in DC.
[02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:55.720]   I've been so lucky.
[02:29:55.720 --> 02:30:00.480]   I've had a lot of cool jobs and I've just been able to experience a lot of this stuff.
[02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:05.840]   So I'm really hoping that people who are listening to this who may have some influence or even
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:09.520]   the viewership, if you want to, you know, reach out to them and all them.
[02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:11.960]   This is a very easily changeable problem.
[02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:14.960]   It's a cartel which has no official power.
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:18.200]   It's all power by tradition, and it needs to be blown up.
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.120]   It has it does not serve America's interests to have 50 48 seats, I think, in the White
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:26.080]   House press briefing room, which who people who have audiences of like five.
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:32.960]   It's just makes absolutely zero workspace seats, access credentials and also credentials
[02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:38.760]   that are issued to press and to other like new media journalists at major events should
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:43.680]   take precedence because it's not even about rewarding the creator.
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:45.840]   The American people are here.
[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:46.840]   You need to meet them.
[02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:48.240]   That's your job.
[02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:50.640]   And I'll just end with a historical thing.
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:56.120]   Barack Obama shocked the White House press corps in 2009 because he took a question from
[02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:58.780]   the Huffington Post, a brand new blog.
[02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:04.620]   But they were stunned because he knew he said, these blog people, they went all in for me
[02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:05.700]   and I got to reward them.
[02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:07.980]   So there's longstanding precedence of this.
[02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:08.980]   They'll bitch and they'll moan.
[02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:10.020]   They'll be upset.
[02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:13.840]   But it's their fault, you know, that they don't have as much credibility.
[02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:19.120]   And it's incumbent upon the White House, which serves the public, to actually meet them where
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:20.120]   they are.
[02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:23.260]   So I really hope that at least some of this is implemented inside of them.
[02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:24.260]   Yeah.
[02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:29.900]   Apart the cartel, I think you can actually enable greater journalism, frankly, with a
[02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:30.900]   capital J.
[02:31:30.900 --> 02:31:31.900]   Of course.
[02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:36.940]   Because actually in the long form is when you can do better journalism from even just
[02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:38.180]   the politician perspective.
[02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:39.180]   You can disagree.
[02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:41.460]   You can get criticized because you can defend yourself.
[02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:42.700]   I had an idea, actually.
[02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:43.700]   Tell me what you think.
[02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:47.640]   I think a really cool format would be, there's a room right near the press briefing room
[02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:50.860]   called the Roosevelt Room, beautiful room by the way, it's awesome.
[02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:54.820]   It has the Medal of Honor for Teddy Roosevelt, and it has a portrait of him and a portrait
[02:31:54.820 --> 02:31:55.820]   of FDR.
[02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:56.820]   It's one of my favorite rooms in the White House.
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:57.820]   Fuck yeah.
[02:31:57.820 --> 02:31:58.820]   It's so cool.
[02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:03.060]   And so my idea would be in the Roosevelt Room, which is traditionally used for press briefings
[02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:08.980]   and stuff, is like you as the press secretary sit there.
[02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:11.180]   I think there's like 12 seats, something like that.
[02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:14.640]   And you set it all up and you have, let's say, Shure microphones like this.
[02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:18.220]   And that person, that secretary, is going to commit to being there for like two hours.
[02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:20.780]   And new media people can sit around the room.
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:24.340]   All of this being streamed live, by the way, just like the White House press briefing room.
[02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:29.060]   But the expectation is that the type of questions have to be substantive.
[02:32:29.060 --> 02:32:30.220]   Obviously nothing is off limits.
[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:34.940]   You should never, ever accept, "I'm not going to ask about this," especially as a journalist,
[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:35.940]   you can't do that.
[02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:38.500]   Every time they're like, "Hey, please don't ask about this," it's like, "Actually, that's
[02:32:38.500 --> 02:32:40.560]   probably the one thing you should ask about."
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:44.700]   But my point being that the expectation is that there's no interference on the White
[02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:49.720]   House side, but that the format itself will lend exactly to what you're saying to allow
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:51.180]   people to explain.
[02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:57.100]   And again, in a media era where we need to trust the consumer, like my show is routinely
[02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:00.960]   over two hours long on cable television.
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:06.100]   On cable television, the Tucker Carlson program, whenever it was on Fox News, without commercial
[02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:09.780]   breaks was about 42, 43 minutes, something like that of runtime.
[02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:14.800]   So I'm speaking for almost triple what that is on a regular basis.
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:19.760]   The point is, is that millions are willing to sit and to listen, but you just have to
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:21.200]   meet them where they are.
[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:25.780]   So I would really hope that a format like that, like a streamer briefing or something
[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:30.240]   like that, I think it's, look, I know they would dunk on it endlessly, but I think it
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:31.240]   could work.
[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:32.240]   Yeah.
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:33.240]   I think the incentives are different.
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:39.440]   I think it works because you don't have to, like you Saga, don't have to signal to the
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:41.360]   other journalists that you're part of the clique.
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:44.200]   Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up because that was another lesson I learned.
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:47.360]   I go, oh, none of you are asking important questions for the people.
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:51.120]   You're asking questions because you all hang out with each other and you're like, oh wait.
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:57.800]   So this entire thing is a self-reinforcing guild to impress each other at cocktail parties
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:00.880]   and not to actually ask anything interesting.
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:07.320]   I remember people were so mad at me because this was 2018 or maybe 2017 and I said, do
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:12.840]   you think that Kim Jong-un is sincere in his willingness to meet with you?
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:14.460]   Something like that, to that effect.
[02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:18.840]   They were furious because I didn't ask about some bullshit political controversy that was
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:19.920]   happening at the time.
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:24.040]   So in the historical legacy, what was more important?
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:31.040]   The Mueller question or Donald Trump breaking 50 years or whatever of tradition with America's
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:35.000]   relationship with North Korea and meeting him in Singapore and basically resetting that
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.840]   relationship for all time?
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:38.040]   As you can tell, I read a lot of book.
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:39.800]   I like to take the long view.
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:45.960]   Every time I would ask a question, I go, okay, when the future Robert Caro is writing books
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:49.480]   and he sees, he's reading the transcript of the White House press briefing, he doesn't
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:50.480]   even know who this kid is.
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:52.680]   He goes, oh, that's a pretty good question right there.
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:54.720]   That's pretty relevant.
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:57.280]   You gotta think about all the bullshit that gets left on the cutting room floor.
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:00.040]   I love that view of journalism actually.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:04.680]   The goal is to end up as one line in a history book 50 years from now.
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:08.400]   I just want a quote of what the president said to something I asked in a book.
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:09.400]   I'd be happy.
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:10.400]   I would die happy with that.
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:15.540]   If you told me that when I'm like a 90 year old man, I'd be like, man, that means I succeeded.
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:20.000]   When the AI's write the history of human civilization.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.680]   One of the things I continuously learn from you when looking back through history is how
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:29.680]   crazy American politics has been throughout history.
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:31.560]   It makes me feel a lot better about the current day.
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:32.560]   It should.
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:33.560]   Corruption.
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:34.560]   Yes.
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:43.300]   Just the divisiveness also, just the insanity, stealing elections at all levels of government
[02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:47.840]   and direct stealing and indirect stealing all kinds of stuff.
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:56.600]   Is there stuff that jumps out to mind throughout history that's just like the craziest corruptions
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:59.320]   or stealing of elections that come to mind?
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:00.960]   I'll give you the micro and the macro.
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:05.720]   So my favorite example is Robert Caro, who I've probably talked about him a lot.
[02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:06.720]   God bless you, Robert.
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:10.600]   I hope you live to write your last book because we really need that from you.
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:13.840]   But Robert came to Texas.
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:18.200]   He only intended on writing three books about Lyndon Johnson.
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:21.380]   He's currently completed four and he's on his fifth and it's taken him over 40 years
[02:36:21.380 --> 02:36:22.440]   to write those.
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:25.840]   And one of the reasons is he just kept uncovering so much stuff.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:29.080]   And one of them is book two means of ascent.
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:30.800]   He never intended to write it.
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:37.000]   But as he began to investigate Lyndon Johnson's 1948 Senate election, he realizes in real
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.160]   time how rigged and stolen it was.
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:46.480]   And so I often tell people, what if I told you that we lived in the most secure election
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:48.720]   period in modern history?
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:49.840]   They wouldn't believe it.
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:55.800]   But if you read through that shit, I'm talking about bags of cash, millions of dollars, literal
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:57.920]   stuffed ballot boxes.
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:01.820]   It's great to be back here in Texas because I always think about that place like down
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:03.900]   in Zapata and Starr County.
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:11.180]   I'm talking like basically Mexico, where these dons were in power in the 1940s and they would
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:14.620]   literally stuff the ballot boxes with the rolls and they wouldn't even allow people
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:15.620]   to come and vote.
[02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:19.840]   They just checkmarked it all for you based upon the amount they paid.
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:26.140]   Means of ascent is the painstaking detail of exactly how Lyndon Johnson stole the 1948
[02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:27.140]   Senate election.
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:31.420]   And so nothing, nothing like that, as far as I know, is still happening.
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:37.620]   On a micro, we can talk about the 1876 election, Rutherford B. Hayes, one of the closest elections
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:38.980]   in modern history.
[02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:41.160]   It was one of those that got kicked with the House of Representatives.
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:43.620]   That was an insane, insane time.
[02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:48.440]   The corrupt bargain that was struck to basically end Reconstruction and federal occupation
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:49.440]   of the South.
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:54.720]   And of course, the amount of wheeling and dealing that happened inside of that was absolutely
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:56.080]   bonkers and nuts.
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:59.820]   That was what an actual stolen election looks like, just so people know.
[02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:04.040]   So on a micro and a macro, yeah, that's what it really looks like.
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:06.420]   And so, look, I understand where people are coming from.
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:08.620]   Also, let's do what, 1960?
[02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:09.620]   That was pretty wild.
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:15.400]   I mean, in 1960, there was all those allegations about Illinois going for Kennedy.
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:20.340]   If you look at the actual vote totals of Kennedy, Nixon, wow, I mean, it's such an insanely
[02:38:20.340 --> 02:38:23.100]   close presidential election.
[02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:26.760]   And even though the Electoral College victory looks a little bit differently, Nixon would
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:32.440]   openly talk about, he's like, "Oh, old Joe Kennedy rigged Illinois for his boy."
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:35.900]   And he'd be like, "And we didn't even have a chance in Texas with Lyndon pulling, you
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:40.640]   know, like Lyndon stuffing the ballot boxes down there."
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:43.760]   And this is open on the, like, they openly admit this stuff.
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:44.760]   They talk about it.
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:48.280]   So actually, there's a funny story.
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:54.400]   LBJ lost his, I think it's 1941 Senate primary.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:59.840]   And it's because his opponent, Pappy O'Daniel, actually outstole Lyndon.
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:01.100]   So they were both corrupt.
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:05.600]   But Pappy O'Daniel stuffed the ballot box in, like, the fifth day of the seven days
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:06.880]   to count the votes.
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:09.440]   And FDR loved LBJ.
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:15.280]   And it's interesting, right, that FDR recognized Johnson's, his talent.
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:20.760]   And he goes, "Lyndon, you, you know, in New York, we sit on the ballot boxes till we count
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:21.760]   them."
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:25.400]   And he's admitting that he, you know, you know, participated in a lot of this stuff.
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:32.280]   So this high level chicanery of stolen elections is actually an American pastime that we luckily
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:34.380]   have moved on from.
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:39.280]   And quite a lot of people do not know the exact intricate details of how wild it was
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:40.280]   back in the day.
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:44.260]   Yeah, it's actually one of the things, it's harder to pull off a bunch of bullshit with
[02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:46.360]   all these cameras everywhere now.
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:50.480]   Transparency too, lack of cash, banking regulations, there's a variety of reasons, but yeah.
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:53.800]   So that said, let's talk about the 2020 election.
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:55.520]   Seems like forever ago.
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:58.920]   Do you think it was rigged the way that Trump claimed?
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:00.160]   No.
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:03.160]   And was it rigged in other ways?
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:05.600]   This is the problem with language like "rigged."
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.800]   And by the way, when I interviewed Vivek Ramaswamy, he said the exact same thing.
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:13.160]   So for all the MAGA people who are going to get mad at me, Vivek agrees, all right?
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:20.080]   And if, okay, I have observed, and I'm going to put my analyst hat on.
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:22.940]   There are two theories of stop the steal.
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:27.160]   One I call low IQ stop the steal, and one I call high IQ stop the steal.
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:32.800]   Low IQ stop the steal is basically what Donald Trump has advocated where, you know, Dominion
[02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:39.040]   voting machines and bamboo ballots and Venezuela and Sidney Powell and all the people involved
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:40.800]   basically got indicted by the state of Georgia.
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:41.960]   I'm not saying that that was correct.
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:46.140]   I'm just like, that's what that actually looked like, Rudy Giuliani, et cetera.
[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:52.620]   High IQ stop the steal is basically, and actually, I mean, these are not illegitimate arguments.
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:58.640]   The school of thought is it was illegitimate for the state of Pennsylvania and other swing
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:05.020]   states to change mail-in balloting laws as a response to COVID, which enabled millions
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:10.100]   of people more to vote that wouldn't have, and that those change in regulations became
[02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:11.300]   enough to swing the election.
[02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:12.900]   I actually think that that is true.
[02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:15.620]   Now, would you say that that's rigged?
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:19.140]   That's a very important question because we're talking about a Republican state legislature,
[02:41:19.140 --> 02:41:21.140]   a Republican state Supreme court, right?
[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:23.180]   The two that actually ruled on this question.
[02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:26.660]   So could you say that it was rigged by the Democrats to do that?
[02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:31.500]   Another problem with that theory is that while you can say that that's unfair to change the
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.220]   rules last time around, you can also understand it to a certain extent, and I'm not justifying
[02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:37.220]   it.
[02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:38.220]   I'm just giving you an example.
[02:41:38.220 --> 02:41:44.020]   So for example, after the hurricane hit North Carolina, Republican officials were like,
[02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:48.060]   "Hey, we need to make sure that these people who had Western North Carolina who were affected
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:51.740]   by the hurricane could still be able to have access to the ballot box."
[02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:54.740]   And people were like, "Oh, so you're saying in an extraordinary circumstance that you
[02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:58.900]   should change voting, you know, access and regularity to make sure that people have access."
[02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:03.540]   So my point is you can see the logic through which this happened.
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:09.780]   And the high IQ version is basically the one that was adopted by Josh Hawley whenever he
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:11.260]   voted against certification.
[02:42:11.260 --> 02:42:17.620]   He said that Pennsylvania, particularly election law, and that those changes were unfair and
[02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:21.180]   led to the "rigging" of the election against Donald Trump.
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:25.000]   Now there's an even higher IQ, galaxy brain, stop the steal.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:29.820]   Galaxy brain, stop the steal, is one that you saw with great love and respect, my friend
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:33.260]   J.D. Vance, at his debate with Tim Walz.
[02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:36.420]   When Tim Walz asked him, what did he say?
[02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:38.500]   He said, "Did Donald Trump win the 2020 election?"
[02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:40.780]   He's like, "Tim, focus on the future."
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:45.740]   And then he started talking about censorship, the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:49.700]   If you take a look at the Joe Rogan interview, Rogan actually asked J.D. this.
[02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:51.340]   He's like, "What do you mean you in the election?"
[02:42:51.340 --> 02:42:52.700]   Some version of that.
[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:57.060]   And J.D. was like, "Well, what I get really frustrated by is people will bring up all
[02:42:57.060 --> 02:43:01.620]   these insane conspiracy theories, but they ignore that the media censored the Hunter
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:07.660]   Biden laptop story and that big tech had its finger on the thumb for the Democrats."
[02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:09.460]   Now that is empirically true, okay?
[02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:10.640]   That is true, right?
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:13.260]   Now, would you say that that's rigged?
[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:15.580]   I'm not gonna use that word, 'cause that's a very different word.
[02:43:15.580 --> 02:43:17.020]   Now, would you say that that's unfair?
[02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:19.340]   Yeah, I think it's unfair.
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:23.860]   So there's another, there's a lot of MAGA folks picked up on this one.
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:27.980]   There was a Time Magazine article in 2020 that's very famous in their crowd called,
[02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:30.860]   you know, it was like the fight to fortify the election.
[02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:36.140]   And it was about all of these institutions that put their fingers on the scale for Joe
[02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:37.940]   Biden against Donald Trump.
[02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:39.980]   So I will put it this way.
[02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:48.200]   Is Donald Trump up against the titanic forces of billionaires, tech censorship, and elite
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:53.400]   institutions who all did absolute damnedest to defeat him in 2020?
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:55.160]   Yes, that is true.
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:44:02.240]   And in a sense, the Galaxy Brain case is the only one of those, which I think is truly
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:03.240]   legitimate.
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:07.800]   And I'm not gonna put it off the table, but this is the problem.
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:09.160]   That's not what Trump means.
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.520]   You know, Trump, by the way, will never tell you what I just told you, right?
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:14.680]   J.D. will.
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:19.480]   If you go and you ask any of these Republican politicians when they're challenged on it
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:23.880]   and they don't wanna say that Trump, a loss of 2020 election, they'll give the Galaxy
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:25.600]   Brain case that I just gave.
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:30.160]   And again, I don't think it's wrong, but it's like, guys, that's not what he means when
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.320]   he says it.
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:33.600]   And that's the important parsing of the case, right?
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:38.120]   So first at a high level, Trump or otherwise, I don't like anyone who whines when they lose,
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:39.120]   period.
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:40.320]   Although he did tell you he lost.
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:41.320]   You noticed that?
[02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:43.680]   That's the only time he's ever said it, ever.
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:44.680]   You're famous.
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:45.680]   You're in history for that one.
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:46.680]   Lost by a whisker.
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:47.680]   Yeah.
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:48.680]   Lost by a whisker.
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:54.280]   I mean, there is a case to be made that he was joking, I don't know.
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:58.320]   But there is a kind of weaving that he does with humor, where sometimes it's sarcasm,
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:44:59.680]   sometimes not.
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.880]   Much easier to showcase in a three-hour interview, I'll say.
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:04.880]   Good call.
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:05.880]   Go ahead.
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:07.840]   I couldn't even play with that when you have 40 minutes.
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:08.840]   I know, bro.
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:13.920]   It's like, you know, I could do just 40 minutes on weaving alone.
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:15.680]   For your style, it doesn't work.
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:20.160]   And I can tell you how the way I interview politicians is I just do pure policy.
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:24.360]   So when I, the first time I interviewed Trump, I compiled a list of 15 subjects, me and my
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:27.420]   editor Vince Collonier, shout out to Vince.
[02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:32.000]   And the two of us sat in an office and then we had questions by priority in each category.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.920]   And if we felt like we were running short on time, we would move around those different
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:36.920]   ones.
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:37.920]   But that was purely, he's the president.
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:40.920]   You're not asking him for his opinions on an immigration bill or whatever.
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:42.920]   For what you do, it's impossible to do it for him.
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:49.760]   I just want to say that thank you for everybody involved for making my conversation with Donald
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:50.760]   Trump possible.
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:57.800]   But I've learned a lot from that, that I just, if I'm told that all I have is 40 minutes,
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:03.840]   I'm very politely sparing, in that case, Donald Trump, the 40 minutes and just walking away.
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:04.840]   Yeah.
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:05.840]   Because I don't think I can do a good job.
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:09.000]   I think that is the correct decision on your part.
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.400]   And I also would encourage you to have the confidence at this point, that you are in
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:18.720]   a position of something that we call in the business, the ability to compel the interview.
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:24.880]   And to compel means to be able to bring somebody else to you and not the other way around.
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:29.420]   And I think that you and Rogan and a few others are in that very unique position.
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:33.480]   And I would really encourage you guys to stick to your guns on things that make you feel
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:38.920]   comfortable because those of us in news, we will always negotiate, we're willing to do
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:40.800]   short form because we're asking about policy.
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:44.600]   But for the style that you help popularize, and I think that you're uniquely talented
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:47.280]   and good at, that's very important not to compromise on.
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:48.280]   So-
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:49.280]   Thank you for saying those words.
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.600]   And that's not just in the interest of journalism, in the interest of conversation, it's the
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:54.160]   interest of the guests as well.
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:55.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:56.160]   To bring out the best in them.
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:57.160]   Yeah.
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:00.400]   I mean, I would feel really at a disservice and I would feel like people would not get
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:05.520]   a unique understanding of my own thought process and my backstory if I was not able to sit
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:11.480]   here for literally hours and to explain in deep detail how I think about the world.
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:16.240]   Not that anyone cares that much, but it's just like, I hope, all I can do is I hope
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:17.240]   it's helpful.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:19.080]   I want to help people think.
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.280]   Because when I was growing up, I was growing up not far from here, 90 minutes from here
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:24.280]   in College Station.
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:27.680]   I felt very uniquely closed off from the world.
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:33.720]   And I found the world through books and books saved my life so many different times.
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:35.760]   And I hope to encourage that in other people.
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:40.280]   I really, no matter where you are, no matter who you are, no matter how busy you are, you
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:45.520]   have some time to either sit down with a book or put on an audio book and you can transport
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:47.600]   yourself into a different world.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:48.800]   It's so important.
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:51.600]   And that's something that your show really helps me with too.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:55.080]   I love listening to your show whenever, sometimes when I'm too into politics and I need to listen
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:57.360]   to something, I'll listen to that Mayan historian guy.
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:47:58.640]   I love stuff like that.
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:47:59.640]   Absolutely.
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:04.720]   I've been a deep dove on Genghis Khan, reading Genghis Khan and then making The Modern World.
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:05.720]   Yeah.
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:06.720]   Jack Weatherford.
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:07.720]   Yeah.
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:08.720]   He's coming on.
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:09.720]   Is he?
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:10.720]   Yeah.
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:11.720]   Amazing.
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:12.720]   And again, shout out to Dan Carlin.
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:13.720]   The GOAT.
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:14.720]   The OG.
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:15.720]   Dan, I've never met you before.
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:17.200]   I would love to correspond at some point.
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:18.200]   I love you so much.
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.200]   You changed my life, man.
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:26.160]   I met him once before and it felt, I was starstruck, very, very starstruck.
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:29.240]   And his, I mean, just so much painful attainment that I've listened to that many times.
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:34.000]   I think his best series, one of his best series, he gets no credit for, Ghosts of the Ostfront.
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:35.080]   Nobody gives him credit for that one.
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:36.080]   That's OG.
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:37.420]   This is a 2011 series.
[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:45.000]   But his Ghosts of the Ostfront on the Eastern front of the Nazi war against Russia fundamentally
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.420]   changed my view of warfare forever.
[02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:49.840]   And also at that time, I was very young.
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:52.160]   And to me, World War II was Saving Private Ryan.
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:54.720]   I wasn't as well read as I am now.
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:59.280]   And I was like, "Oh shit, this entire thing happened, which actually decided the Second
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:00.280]   World War."
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:02.380]   And I don't know anything about this.
[02:49:02.380 --> 02:49:03.640]   So shout out to Dan.
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:04.640]   God bless you, man.
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:10.560]   And his "short episodes," I think, on slavery in general throughout human history.
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:11.840]   That was an awesome episode.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:15.000]   I actually bought a bunch of Hugh Thomas books because of that episode.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.120]   I'd never really read about African slavery or the slave trade outside of the Civil War
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:21.120]   context.
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:22.120]   So again, shout out to him for that one.
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:23.120]   That was an amazing episode.
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:24.440]   His Japan series, too.
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:26.560]   I'm going to Japan in a few days.
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:31.000]   And I keep thinking of what he always talked about in his Supernova in the East, "The Japanese
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:34.080]   are like everyone else, but only more so."
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:36.080]   And God, I love that quote.
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:37.080]   Okay.
[02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:38.080]   He's great.
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:44.200]   And we, ironically, arrived at this tangent while talking about the 2020 election.
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:45.200]   Yeah.
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.040]   That's why podcasting is fun.
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:49.640]   Because he said, "Lost by a whisker."
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:55.560]   And now we're dragging us screaming back to the topic.
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:03.360]   One of the things I was bothered by is Trump claiming that there's widespread, as you're
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:06.760]   saying, low IQ theory, the widespread voter fraud.
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:11.800]   And I saw no evidence of that that he provided.
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:14.720]   And all right, well, let's put that on the table.
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:19.720]   And then the other thing I was troubled by, that maybe you can comfort me in the context
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:28.920]   of history, how easily the base ate that up, that they were able to believe the election
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:34.060]   was truly rigged based on no clear evidence that I saw.
[02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:36.120]   And they just love the story.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:41.860]   And there is something compelling to the story that, like this DNC type, like with Bernie,
[02:50:41.860 --> 02:50:48.380]   the establishment, just they're corrupt and they steal the will of the people.
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:56.800]   And the lack of desire from the base or from people to see any evidence of that, what's
[02:50:56.800 --> 02:50:57.800]   really troubled me.
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:50:58.800]   Yeah.
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:02.420]   I'm going to give you one of the most depressing quotes, which is deeply true.
[02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:06.880]   Roger Ailes, who is a genius, shout out to "The Loudest Voice in the Room" by Gabriel
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:07.880]   Sherman.
[02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:11.220]   That book changed my life too, because it really made me understand the media.
[02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:12.440]   People don't want to be informed.
[02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:14.400]   They want to feel informed.
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:17.860]   That is one of the most fundamental media insights of all time.
[02:51:17.860 --> 02:51:18.860]   What a line.
[02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:24.780]   Roger Ailes, a genius, a genius in his own right, who, you know, he changed the world.
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:25.780]   He certainly did.
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:31.220]   He, you know, he's the one who kind of gets credit for one of the greatest debate lines
[02:51:31.220 --> 02:51:34.600]   of all time, because he was an advisor to President Reagan.
[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:37.900]   Whenever he broke in, he was like, "Mr. President, people want to know if you're too damn old
[02:51:37.900 --> 02:51:39.140]   for this job or not."
[02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:44.480]   And he inspired that joke that Reagan made, where he was like, "I will not use age in
[02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:45.480]   this campaign.
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:48.920]   I will not hold my opponent's youth and inexperience against him."
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:50.020]   That was Ailes, man.
[02:51:50.020 --> 02:51:51.020]   You got it.
[02:51:51.020 --> 02:51:52.600]   He did the Nixon town halls.
[02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:53.600]   He did it all.
[02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:54.600]   He's a fucking genius.
[02:51:54.600 --> 02:52:00.420]   And I'm not advocating necessarily for the world he created for us, but he did it.
[02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:02.060]   And people should study him more.
[02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:05.360]   If you're interested in media in particular, that book is one of the most important books
[02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:06.360]   you'll ever read.
[02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:07.360]   Yeah.
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:12.320]   And that quote just really connected with me, because, you know, there's all this talk
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:18.720]   about truth, and I think what people want to, they want to feel like they're in possession
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:19.720]   of the truth.
[02:52:19.720 --> 02:52:20.720]   Correct.
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:22.680]   Not actually be in the possession of the truth.
[02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:23.680]   Yeah.
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:24.680]   I know.
[02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:25.680]   It's one of them.
[02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:26.680]   It hit me too.
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:30.540]   Actually, Russell Crowe does an amazing job of delivering that line in the Showtime miniseries.
[02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:33.040]   So if you have the chance, you should watch it.
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:34.960]   And look, this is the problem.
[02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:37.180]   People's will be like, yeah, see these idiot Republicans.
[02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:40.160]   I'm like, yeah, you guys have bought a lot of crazy, stupid shit too.
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:41.160]   OK.
[02:52:41.160 --> 02:52:45.240]   And if actually I would say liberal misinformation, quote unquote, is worse than Republican disinformation
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:50.680]   because it pervades the entire elite media like Russiagate or Cambridge Analytica or
[02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:55.280]   any of these other hoaxes that have been foisted on the American people.
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:53:00.800]   The people who listen to the Daily and from the New York Times are just as brainwashed,
[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:05.680]   lack of informed, want to feel informed as people who watch Fox News.
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:07.200]   So let me just say that out there.
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:10.240]   It's an equal opportunity cancer in the American.
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:16.720]   Actually, we started early on in the conversation talking about bubbles.
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:21.840]   What's your advice about how to figure out if you're in a bubble and how to get out of
[02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:22.840]   it?
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:24.320]   Oh, that's such a fantastic question.
[02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:28.600]   Unfortunately, I think it comes really naturally to someone like me because I'm the child of
[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:31.360]   immigrants and I was raised in College Station, Texas.
[02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:33.880]   So I was always on the outside.
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:36.760]   And when you're on the outside, this isn't a sob story.
[02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:41.360]   It's a deeply useful skill, because when you're on the outside, you're forced to kind of observe
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:42.720]   and you're like, oh.
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:49.160]   So like when I was raised was the Bible belt and people really, you know, people were hardcore
[02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:50.160]   evangelical Christians.
[02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:52.360]   And I could tell them, like, oh, they really believe this stuff.
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:56.520]   And, you know, they were always trying to proselytize and all of that.
[02:53:56.520 --> 02:54:00.200]   And then the other gift that my parents gave me is I got to travel the entire world.
[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:04.400]   I probably visited 25, 30 countries by the time I was 18.
[02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:10.040]   And one of the things that that gave me was the ability to just put yourself in the brain
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:11.440]   of another person.
[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:15.080]   So one of the reasons I'm really excited to go to Japan and I picked it as a spot for
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:21.400]   my honeymoon was because Japan is a first world developed country where the vast majority
[02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:23.120]   of them don't speak English.
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:28.480]   It's distinguishedly non-Western and they just do shit their own way.
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:31.100]   So they have a subway, but it's not the same as ours.
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:32.280]   They have restaurants.
[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:33.460]   Things don't work the same way.
[02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:36.000]   They have, you know, I could go to a laundry list.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:42.160]   Their entire philosophy of life of the daily rhythm, even though it merges with service
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:48.040]   based managerial capitalism and they're fucking good at it too, they do it their own way.
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:53.360]   So exposure to other countries in the world gave me, and also just being an outsider myself,
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:55.680]   gave me a more detached view of the world.
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:59.480]   So if you don't have that, what I would encourage you is to flex that muscle.
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:03.080]   So go somewhere that makes you uncomfortable.
[02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:07.720]   This will be a very boomer take, but I hate the fact that you have 5G everywhere you go
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:12.320]   in the world because some of the best experiences I've ever had in my life is walking around
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:17.860]   Warsaw, Poland, trying to find a bus station to get my ass to Lithuania with a printed
[02:55:17.860 --> 02:55:19.040]   out bus ticket.
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:20.760]   I have no idea where the street is.
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:23.500]   I have, I'm in a country where not that many people speak English.
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:25.800]   We're pointing and gesturing right.
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:27.680]   And I figured it out and it was really easy.
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:29.920]   I got to meet a lot of cool Polish people.
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:30.920]   Same in Thailand.
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:36.000]   I've been in rural, like bum fuck, Thailand, Columbia, places where people speak zero English
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:42.480]   and your ability to gesture and use pigeon really connects you and gives you like the
[02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:46.600]   ability to to get an exposure to others.
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:51.900]   And so I know this is a very like wanderlust, like travel thing, but unironically, if you're
[02:55:51.900 --> 02:55:56.400]   raised in a bubble, pierce it like that's the answer is seek something out that makes
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:57.560]   you uncomfortable.
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:56:01.000]   So if you're raised rich, you need to go spend some time with poor people and consider that
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.960]   they might actually understand the world better than you.
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:05.080]   Well, in some respects.
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:07.760]   So I think a lot of rich people have really screwed up personal lives.
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:11.700]   So if you're poor and you really value family, you say, oh, that's interesting.
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:15.620]   There seems to be a fundamental trade off between extraordinary wealth and something
[02:56:15.620 --> 02:56:16.780]   that I value.
[02:56:16.780 --> 02:56:19.240]   But what can I take away from that person?
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:21.880]   Oh, put my money in index funds.
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:26.920]   Make sure that I am conscientious about my budgeting and common sense shit.
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:33.560]   And vice versa, people who are very wealthy get so caught up in the rat race about their
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:36.580]   kids going to private school and all of this.
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:39.880]   And then, you know, they very rarely engage with there's that famous study where they
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:42.800]   ask people on their deathbed, like what they valued in life.
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:45.940]   And every single one of them was like, I wish I'd spend more time with my children.
[02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:50.540]   I think about that every time that I am thinking about pursuing a new work endeavor or something
[02:56:50.540 --> 02:56:54.340]   that's going to have me spend significant time away from my wife.
[02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:59.820]   And I'm almost always these days, now that I've achieved a certain level of success,
[02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:03.980]   the answer is I'm not doing it unless she can come with me.
[02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:08.180]   One of the bubbles I'm really concerned about San Francisco bubble I visit there recently
[02:57:08.180 --> 02:57:15.520]   because there's so many friends there that I respect deeply, so many brilliant people
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:23.000]   in San Francisco, the Silicon Valley, but there's just this, I don't even want to criticize
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.080]   it, but there's definitely a bubble of thought.
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:27.080]   I'm with you.
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:30.400]   I'm friends with some SP, Silicon Valley people as well.
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:34.880]   I'm similarly struck by that every time I go.
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:40.580]   And honestly, I do admire them because they, what I respect the most amongst entrepreneurs,
[02:57:40.580 --> 02:57:43.360]   business, and political thinkers is systems thinking.
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:47.180]   Nobody thinks systems better than people who are in tech because they deal with global
[02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:48.340]   shit, right?
[02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:49.340]   Not even just America.
[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:52.740]   They have to think about the whole world, about the human being and his relationship
[02:57:52.740 --> 02:57:57.620]   to technology and coding in some ways is an expression of the human mind and about how
[02:57:57.620 --> 02:57:59.620]   that person wants to achieve this thing.
[02:57:59.620 --> 02:58:04.300]   And hey, you mechanically can type that into a keyboard or even code something to code
[02:58:04.300 --> 02:58:06.500]   for you to be able to achieve that.
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:08.660]   That's a remarkable accomplishment.
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:14.740]   I do think those people and people like that too, who think very linearly through math
[02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:19.040]   and they're, the geniuses are the ones who can take their creativity and merge it with
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:20.360]   linear thinking.
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:26.460]   But I do think that that actually, those are the people who probably most need to get out
[02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:29.260]   of the bubble, check themselves a little bit.
[02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:30.740]   And look, it's really hard.
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:35.020]   You know, once you achieve a certain level of economic success and others, like what
[02:58:35.020 --> 02:58:36.380]   do most rich people do?
[02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:38.260]   They closed themselves off from the world, right?
[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:40.020]   That's the vast majority of the time.
[02:58:40.020 --> 02:58:41.140]   What do you do?
[02:58:41.140 --> 02:58:42.280]   Economy is annoying, flying.
[02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:43.280]   They fly first class.
[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:45.880]   Living in a small house is annoying.
[02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:47.780]   They buy a bigger house.
[02:58:47.780 --> 02:58:49.940]   Dealing with a lot of these inconveniences of life is annoying.
[02:58:49.940 --> 02:58:52.300]   You pay a little bit more to make sure you don't have to do that.
[02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:56.900]   There's a deep insidious thing within that, each one of those individual choices where
[02:58:56.900 --> 02:59:00.660]   the more and more removed that you get from that, the more in the bubble that you are.
[02:59:00.660 --> 02:59:07.180]   So you should actually seek out those experiences or create them in a concerted way.
[02:59:07.180 --> 02:59:12.020]   - Speaking of bubbles, Sam Harris.
[02:59:12.020 --> 02:59:17.980]   He has continued to criticize me directly and indirectly, I think unfairly, but I love
[02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:18.980]   Sam.
[02:59:18.980 --> 02:59:20.620]   I deeply respect him.
[02:59:20.620 --> 02:59:24.740]   Everybody should listen to the Making Sense podcast, it always makes me think.
[02:59:24.740 --> 02:59:27.500]   It's definitely in the rotation for me.
[02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:28.700]   - That's very admirable of you.
[02:59:28.700 --> 02:59:36.580]   - I mean, he's, I think, one of the sharpest minds of our generation, and for a long time
[02:59:36.580 --> 02:59:37.580]   I looked up to him.
[02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:41.900]   It was one of the weird moments for me to meet him, because you listen to somebody for
[02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:42.900]   such a long time.
[02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:44.900]   - I feel that way with you.
[02:59:44.900 --> 02:59:45.900]   I'm serious.
[02:59:45.900 --> 02:59:51.660]   - Yeah, it's a beautiful moment, I mean, same with Joe and stuff like this.
[02:59:51.660 --> 02:59:55.440]   - It is one of the most surreal moments of your life, to be able to meet somebody who
[02:59:55.440 --> 02:59:57.780]   you spend hours listening to.
[02:59:57.780 --> 03:00:01.180]   I actually think about that when people come up to me, 'cause I'm like, oh, they're feeling
[03:00:01.180 --> 03:00:02.180]   what I felt.
[03:00:02.180 --> 03:00:08.820]   - And you have to, you see it, you feel it, and you have to celebrate that, because there's
[03:00:08.820 --> 03:00:12.500]   an intimacy to it.
[03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:17.220]   I think it's real, that people really do form a real connection, a real friendship.
[03:00:17.220 --> 03:00:22.580]   It happens to be one way, but I think it actually can upgrade to a two-way pretty easily.
[03:00:22.580 --> 03:00:26.460]   It happens with me in a matter of five minutes when I meet somebody at an airport or something
[03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:27.460]   like that.
[03:00:27.460 --> 03:00:31.820]   But anyway, Sam took a pretty strong position on Trump.
[03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:33.460]   - And has for a long time.
[03:00:33.460 --> 03:00:38.620]   - Yeah, he has been consistent and unwavering.
[03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:46.700]   So he thinks that Trump is a truly dangerous person for our democracy, for maybe for the
[03:00:46.700 --> 03:00:47.700]   world.
[03:00:47.700 --> 03:00:49.780]   Can you steel man his position?
[03:00:49.780 --> 03:00:54.300]   - Well, see, I think a lot of this podcast has been steel manning it, because Sam is
[03:00:54.300 --> 03:00:56.780]   a big character matters guy.
[03:00:56.780 --> 03:00:58.940]   He focuses a lot on Trump's personality.
[03:00:58.940 --> 03:01:01.540]   By the way, I'm like you, I've listened to Sam Harris for years.
[03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:06.020]   I bought his meditation app, so nobody's going to accuse me of being some Sam Harris hater.
[03:01:06.020 --> 03:01:10.780]   I listened to him for way before, long before even Donald Trump was elected.
[03:01:10.780 --> 03:01:13.620]   That's how far back I go with the Sam Harris podcast.
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:18.220]   I have a lot of respect for the dude, I enjoy a lot of his older interviews.
[03:01:18.220 --> 03:01:23.420]   I do think after Trump, he did succumb a little bit, in my opinion, to the elite liberalism
[03:01:23.420 --> 03:01:29.820]   view, both of the impetus behind Donald Trump and why he was able to be successful.
[03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:34.660]   So in some ways, very denigrating to the Trump voter, but also a fundamental misunderstanding
[03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:36.340]   of the American presidency.
[03:01:36.340 --> 03:01:40.900]   Because like I said, he really is the one who believes that that narcissism, that character,
[03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:45.640]   and all of that that makes Trump tick itself will eventually override any potential benefit
[03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:47.300]   that he could have in office.
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:50.620]   And I just think that's a really wrong way of looking at it.
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:56.340]   And I mean, for example, I had this debate with Crystal, and this gets to the whole Trump,
[03:01:56.340 --> 03:02:01.300]   you know, talking about the enemy from within, and she was like, "He wants to prosecute his
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:02.300]   political opponents.
[03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:03.420]   Do you disagree with that?"
[03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:05.100]   And I was like, "No, I don't."
[03:02:05.100 --> 03:02:06.740]   And she was like, "So you're not worried about it?"
[03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:08.500]   And I go, "No, I'm not."
[03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:09.700]   And she's like, "Well, how do you square that?"
[03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:15.300]   And I was like, "Well, I actually unironically believe in the American system of institutional
[03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:19.740]   checks and balances," which kept him "in check" last time around.
[03:02:19.740 --> 03:02:25.540]   I also believe in democracy, where, you know, this is really interesting, but, you know,
[03:02:25.540 --> 03:02:30.020]   in 2022, a lot of the Republicans who were the most vociferous about Stop the Steal,
[03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:32.420]   they got their asses kicked at the ballot box.
[03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:38.060]   You know, Americans also then, in 2024, decided to forgive some of that from Donald Trump.
[03:02:38.060 --> 03:02:39.860]   It definitely didn't help, right?
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:43.040]   But they were able to oversee that for their own interests.
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:47.820]   As in, democratically, people are able to weigh, in terms of checks and balances, what
[03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:50.220]   they should and should not challenge a politician by.
[03:02:50.220 --> 03:02:55.740]   But also, we have the American legal system, and I also know the way that the institutions
[03:02:55.740 --> 03:03:01.820]   in Washington themselves work, that, you know, fundamentally, the way that certain processes
[03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:06.780]   and other things could play out will not play out to some Hitlerian fantasy.
[03:03:06.780 --> 03:03:11.340]   And this gets to the whole, like, Kamala and them calling him a fascist and Hitler.
[03:03:11.340 --> 03:03:16.900]   You know, you and I probably spent hours of our lives, maybe more, thinking and reading
[03:03:16.900 --> 03:03:22.300]   about Adolf Hitler or Weimar Germany, and I just find it so insulting, you know, because
[03:03:22.300 --> 03:03:25.620]   it becomes this moniker of, like, fascism.
[03:03:25.620 --> 03:03:30.700]   These terms have meaning beyond just the dictionary definition.
[03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:36.500]   The circumstances through which Hitler is able to rise to power are not the same as
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:37.580]   today.
[03:03:37.580 --> 03:03:42.580]   It's like, stop denigrating America to the point where you think, like, really, you should
[03:03:42.580 --> 03:03:43.580]   flip it around.
[03:03:43.580 --> 03:03:45.500]   Why do you think America's Weimar Germany?
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:47.180]   That's a ridiculous thing to say!
[03:03:47.180 --> 03:03:48.980]   Do you unironically believe that?
[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:49.980]   No!
[03:03:49.980 --> 03:03:50.980]   You don't believe that.
[03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:54.340]   So, that is personally what drives me a little bit crazy.
[03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:59.460]   And I think that Sam has found himself in a mental framework where he is not willing—he
[03:03:59.460 --> 03:04:04.740]   is not able to look past "the man" and his "danger."
[03:04:04.740 --> 03:04:10.340]   And at the end of the day, his worldview was rejected wholly by the American people.
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:14.700]   And that—because the character argument, the fascist argument, the Hitler argument,
[03:04:14.700 --> 03:04:20.380]   he is uniquely bad argument, has been run twice before, 2016 and in 2000—actually,
[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:21.380]   all three times.
[03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:22.940]   I guess it won in 2020.
[03:04:22.940 --> 03:04:26.980]   But two out of the three times, Donald Trump has won the presidency and in his latest one,
[03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:32.460]   where that argument has never been made before for a longer period of time and more in strength
[03:04:32.460 --> 03:04:35.380]   by a political candidate, was rejected completely.
[03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:39.580]   And I would ask him to reconcile himself to the America that he lives in.
[03:04:39.580 --> 03:04:45.660]   I think one thing, maybe to partially steel man his case, but also just to steel man the
[03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:54.440]   way the world works, is that there is some probability that Kamala Harris will institute
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:56.020]   a communist state.
[03:04:56.020 --> 03:05:03.860]   And there is some probability that Donald Trump will indeed—will fly a swastika with
[03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:07.660]   and deport, I don't know, everybody who's not Scott Irish.
[03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:09.320]   Like, I don't know.
[03:05:09.320 --> 03:05:10.460]   You and I are screwed then.
[03:05:10.460 --> 03:05:11.460]   Maybe.
[03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:12.460]   Is there a spirit test?
[03:05:12.460 --> 03:05:13.460]   Okay.
[03:05:13.460 --> 03:05:14.460]   But that probability is small.
[03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:21.580]   And you have to—if you allow yourself to focus on a particular trajectory with a small
[03:05:21.580 --> 03:05:25.660]   probability, it can become all-encompassing, because you could see it.
[03:05:25.660 --> 03:05:26.660]   You could see a path.
[03:05:26.660 --> 03:05:31.900]   There are certain character qualities to Trump where he wants to hold on to power.
[03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:34.860]   First of all, every politician wants to hold on to power.
[03:05:34.860 --> 03:05:41.980]   Joe Biden, maybe because he's part of the machine, can't even conceive of the notion
[03:05:41.980 --> 03:05:46.540]   of a third term, but he has the arrogance to want to hold on to power, do everything
[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:47.540]   he can.
[03:05:47.540 --> 03:05:48.540]   Absolutely.
[03:05:48.540 --> 03:05:53.340]   And like with Trump, I could see that if it was very popular for him to have a third term,
[03:05:53.340 --> 03:05:59.300]   I think he would not be the kind of person who doesn't advocate for a third term.
[03:05:59.300 --> 03:06:00.300]   So what?
[03:06:00.300 --> 03:06:05.740]   That would require the Senate and the House, or what is it, 75% of the states, to pass
[03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:08.040]   and change the Constitution.
[03:06:08.040 --> 03:06:09.040]   Do you think that's going to happen?
[03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:10.300]   No, I don't think it's going to happen.
[03:06:10.300 --> 03:06:11.620]   So I'm not that worried about it.
[03:06:11.620 --> 03:06:15.420]   Now, you can make a norms argument, and I actually think that's kind of fair, is that
[03:06:15.420 --> 03:06:17.080]   he's the norms buster.
[03:06:17.080 --> 03:06:22.740]   But with extraordinary candidates and people like Trump, you get the good and the bad.
[03:06:22.740 --> 03:06:24.820]   There is a true duality.
[03:06:24.820 --> 03:06:27.900]   The norms he busts around foreign policy, I love.
[03:06:27.900 --> 03:06:30.540]   The norms he busts around the economy, I love.
[03:06:30.540 --> 03:06:34.900]   The norms he busts around just so much of the American political system, saying it how
[03:06:34.900 --> 03:06:35.900]   it is, et cetera.
[03:06:35.900 --> 03:06:36.900]   I love that.
[03:06:36.900 --> 03:06:37.900]   You know what I hate?
[03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:39.620]   This 2020 election bullshit.
[03:06:39.620 --> 03:06:40.620]   You know what else I hate?
[03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:46.500]   You know, this, I don't know, just the lack of discipline that I would want to think that
[03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:49.940]   a great leader could have, like when he was president and tweeting about Mika Brzezinski's
[03:06:49.940 --> 03:06:50.940]   facelift.
[03:06:50.940 --> 03:06:52.420]   That was objectively ridiculous.
[03:06:52.420 --> 03:06:53.420]   Like it was crazy.
[03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:54.420]   Okay.
[03:06:54.420 --> 03:06:55.420]   Was it funny?
[03:06:55.420 --> 03:06:56.420]   Yeah.
[03:06:56.420 --> 03:06:57.420]   But it was crazy.
[03:06:57.420 --> 03:07:01.420]   That's not how I would conceive and have conceived of some of my favorite presidents.
[03:07:01.420 --> 03:07:05.380]   I wouldn't think that they would do that, but that's what you get.
[03:07:05.380 --> 03:07:08.140]   Everyone should be clear-eyed about who this man is.
[03:07:08.140 --> 03:07:09.220]   And that's another problem.
[03:07:09.220 --> 03:07:11.420]   The deification of politicians is sick.
[03:07:11.420 --> 03:07:12.420]   It's sickening.
[03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:17.700]   Like about Trump, around Obama, like these people are just people.
[03:07:17.700 --> 03:07:22.700]   Like the idea that they are God-like creatures with extraordinary judgment.
[03:07:22.700 --> 03:07:25.980]   One of the really cool things about you and I's job is we actually get to meet very important
[03:07:25.980 --> 03:07:26.980]   people.
[03:07:26.980 --> 03:07:29.220]   Like after you meet a few billionaires, you're like, yeah, there's definitely something there,
[03:07:29.220 --> 03:07:31.580]   but you know, some of them get lucky.
[03:07:31.580 --> 03:07:35.580]   And like after you meet a few politicians, you're like, oh, they're like, they're not
[03:07:35.580 --> 03:07:36.580]   that smart.
[03:07:36.580 --> 03:07:40.900]   That was a rude awakening for me, by the way, being here in Texas, reading about these people.
[03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:44.180]   And pretty soon I was on Capitol Hill, I was like 19 years old.
[03:07:44.180 --> 03:07:45.180]   I was an intern.
[03:07:45.180 --> 03:07:49.660]   I'm actually interacting and I see them behave in ridiculous manners and, you know, whatever,
[03:07:49.660 --> 03:07:52.060]   treat people badly or say something stupid.
[03:07:52.060 --> 03:07:54.500]   And I was like, oh, this is not the West Wing.
[03:07:54.500 --> 03:07:58.100]   I'm like, this is not like, these people are just, this is reality.
[03:07:58.100 --> 03:08:01.620]   And the weirdest part of my life is I've now been in Washington long enough.
[03:08:01.620 --> 03:08:06.980]   I know some of the people personally, the vice president of the United States, literally
[03:08:06.980 --> 03:08:12.460]   the vice president-elect, future cabinet secretaries, future, you know, these people I literally
[03:08:12.460 --> 03:08:15.740]   have met, had dinner with, had a drink with, whatever.
[03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:16.900]   That's a wild thing.
[03:08:16.900 --> 03:08:19.100]   And that's even more bringing you down to earth.
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:21.700]   You're like, oh shit, you're actually a lot of power.
[03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:24.120]   That's pretty, that's kind of scary, but you're just a person.
[03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:28.180]   And so even though you don't have to say, I have my same life experience, take it from
[03:08:28.180 --> 03:08:34.060]   me or anybody else who's ever met really famous people, rich, successful, powerful people,
[03:08:34.060 --> 03:08:35.060]   they're just people.
[03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:39.380]   There's nothing that, there's some things that are unique about them, but they have
[03:08:39.380 --> 03:08:43.180]   just as many human qualities as you or anybody else who's listening to this right now.
[03:08:43.180 --> 03:08:44.180]   Yeah.
[03:08:44.180 --> 03:08:47.980]   There's a, for each candidate, Trump is probably the extreme version of that.
[03:08:47.980 --> 03:08:52.200]   There's a, there's a distribution of the possible trajectories that administration
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:53.200]   might result in.
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:54.200]   Yes.
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:08:58.180]   And like the range of possible trajectories is just much wider with Trump.
[03:08:58.180 --> 03:08:59.180]   Yeah.
[03:08:59.180 --> 03:09:00.700]   You're describing like a Bayesian theory, right?
[03:09:00.700 --> 03:09:04.660]   Like an, I think that's actually a really useful framework for the world is that people
[03:09:04.660 --> 03:09:05.920]   are really too binary.
[03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:10.100]   So like you said, you know, there's a theoretical possibility, I guess, of a communist take
[03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:16.700]   over of government and of a fascist takeover of government under Kamala Harris or Donald
[03:09:16.700 --> 03:09:17.700]   Trump.
[03:09:17.700 --> 03:09:22.820]   You know, the realistic probability, I would give it 0.05% probably in both directions.
[03:09:22.820 --> 03:09:26.000]   But there are, you know, there are a lot of things that can happen that are bad that are
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:27.860]   not Hitlerian or fascist.
[03:09:27.860 --> 03:09:31.260]   There are a lot of things that would happen that are really good that are not FDR, New
[03:09:31.260 --> 03:09:32.260]   Deal style.
[03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:36.600]   Uh, one of the worst things politicians do is they describe themselves in false historical
[03:09:36.600 --> 03:09:37.600]   ways.
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:43.060]   So in Washington, one of the most overused phrases is made history.
[03:09:43.060 --> 03:09:48.300]   And I'm like, you know, if you actually read history, most of these things are just, they're
[03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:49.300]   not even footnotes.
[03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:53.980]   They're the stuff that the historians flip past and they're like, what a stupid fucking
[03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:54.980]   thing.
[03:09:54.980 --> 03:09:58.420]   I mean, and I'm talking about things that will that ruled American politics.
[03:09:58.420 --> 03:10:02.460]   Like what if I told you that the Panama Canal Treaty was one of the most important fights
[03:10:02.460 --> 03:10:05.020]   in modern American politics?
[03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:06.900]   Nobody thinks about that today.
[03:10:06.900 --> 03:10:09.180]   It ruled American politics at that time.
[03:10:09.180 --> 03:10:12.680]   You know, it genuinely is a footnote, but that's not how it felt at the time.
[03:10:12.680 --> 03:10:15.820]   So that's another thing I want people to take away.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:19.700]   You, uh, tragically missed the UFO hearings.
[03:10:19.700 --> 03:10:23.620]   Oh man, my brothers, I'm really sad.
[03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:26.580]   Let me tell you, I love them so much.
[03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:31.500]   The UFO community are some of the best people I've ever met in my life.
[03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:36.660]   Shout out to my brother, Jeremy Corbell, to George Knapp, the OG, to all of the people
[03:10:36.660 --> 03:10:39.520]   who fly from all around the world to come to these hearings.
[03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:40.580]   It was so fun.
[03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:42.780]   I got to meet so many of them last time.
[03:10:42.780 --> 03:10:48.420]   Just walk the rope line like as people were coming in, the excitement, the, uh, I, I,
[03:10:48.420 --> 03:10:51.500]   I love, I truly love the UFO community.
[03:10:51.500 --> 03:10:52.500]   Shout out to all of them.
[03:10:52.500 --> 03:10:53.500]   This is the second one, I guess.
[03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:54.500]   This is the second one.
[03:10:54.500 --> 03:10:55.980]   Do you hope they continue happening?
[03:10:55.980 --> 03:10:56.980]   It's going to be a slow burn.
[03:10:56.980 --> 03:11:03.300]   Uh, so one of the things I always tell the guys and everybody is consider how long it
[03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:08.640]   took to understand the sheer insanity of the CIA in the 1950s and 60s.
[03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:13.040]   So if we think back to the church committee, I don't, I forget the exact year of the church
[03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:14.040]   committee.
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:15.040]   I think it was in the seventies.
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:21.360]   Uh, the entire church committee and knowledge of why this, of how the CIA and the FBI were
[03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:25.520]   up to all of this insane shit throughout the fifties and sixties is because some people
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:30.980]   broke into a warehouse, discovered some documents, got the names of programs, which were able
[03:11:30.980 --> 03:11:32.220]   to be foiled.
[03:11:32.220 --> 03:11:33.940]   And we were able to break open that case.
[03:11:33.940 --> 03:11:38.120]   It would never have happened with real transparency, like in the official process.
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:42.040]   So we owe those people a great debt, I guess I could say now the statute of limitations
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:43.040]   has passed.
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:47.800]   Uh, my point about the UFOs is I don't know what is real or not.
[03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:52.200]   I have absolute confidence, an absolute ton is being hid from the American people.
[03:11:52.200 --> 03:11:54.800]   And that all of the official explanations are bullshit.
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:11:59.680]   I have had the opportunity to interface with some of the whistleblowers and other activists
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:04.760]   in the community, people who I trust, people who have great credentials, who have no reason
[03:12:04.760 --> 03:12:09.340]   to lie, who have assured us that there is a lot going on behind the scenes.
[03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:14.000]   There has been too much misinformation and effort by the deep state to cover up this
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:15.000]   topic.
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:20.840]   So I would ask people to keep the faith it's 2024 and we still don't have all the JFK files.
[03:12:20.840 --> 03:12:21.840]   Okay.
[03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:22.840]   Everyone involved is dead.
[03:12:22.840 --> 03:12:24.080]   There's no reason to let it go.
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:29.120]   And even though we basically know what happened, we don't know if you read that fantastic book,
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:31.600]   the Tom O'Neill book about the Manson murders.
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:35.600]   I mean, again, you know, it took him 20 years to write that book and he still didn't get
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:36.600]   the full story.
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:41.520]   So sometimes it takes an extraordinarily long, agonizing period of time.
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:44.080]   And I know how deeply frustrating that is.
[03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:49.560]   But when you think about a secret, a program and knowledge of this magnitude, it would
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:54.840]   only make sense that it would require a titanic effort to reveal a titanic secret.
[03:12:54.840 --> 03:13:00.920]   You think Trump might be able to push for like aggressively break through the secrecy?
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:02.880]   Let's say even on the JFK files.
[03:13:02.880 --> 03:13:03.880]   I hope so.
[03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:08.400]   I have moderate confidence, you know, RFK Jr has pushed him to do so.
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:10.280]   I would like to think so.
[03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:12.200]   At the same time, I saw him got rolled last time.
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:13.800]   So I'm, you know, I'll hold my breath.
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:14.800]   Why do you think that happens?
[03:13:14.800 --> 03:13:15.800]   Why do you think it gets...
[03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:17.600]   Remember that whole interagency thing I told you about?
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:18.680]   That's how it happens.
[03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:19.680]   That's another thing.
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:22.520]   You're presuming that the president has the power to declassify this stuff.
[03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:25.920]   I'm saying that I'm not even sure we're there, like in terms of...
[03:13:25.920 --> 03:13:26.920]   It was basic like stability.
[03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:32.800]   He basically says like, I would like to declassify JFK files and they say, yes, sir, we'll get
[03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:35.840]   that to you in three months and three months comes by.
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:38.040]   And then they're like, well, there's these hurdles.
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:42.080]   Well, the way you get around it is go, let's release some, but these in particular, there's
[03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:45.520]   national security secrets is a good case for not releasing them X, Y, and Z.
[03:13:45.520 --> 03:13:47.600]   You know, it's like you get around that, oh, okay.
[03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:48.600]   You know, that makes sense.
[03:13:48.600 --> 03:13:49.600]   You know?
[03:13:49.600 --> 03:13:50.600]   And again, he's a busy guy.
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:51.600]   He's the president.
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:52.600]   He got way bigger shit to worry about.
[03:13:52.600 --> 03:13:56.960]   But that's the problem is that unless you have that true urgency, I mean, look, people
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:13:58.800]   of immense power have tried.
[03:13:58.800 --> 03:13:59.800]   Everyone forgets this.
[03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:01.960]   John Podesta was the White House chief of staff.
[03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:04.600]   He is a UFO true believer in his heart.
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:05.600]   He tried.
[03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:06.600]   He's talked about it.
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:11.560]   He tried at the top level, the number two to the White House to get the Pentagon and
[03:14:11.560 --> 03:14:13.240]   others to tell him what was going on.
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:14.240]   And they stonewalled him.
[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:16.900]   So people need to understand what you're up against.
[03:14:16.900 --> 03:14:20.200]   And you know, I would, and people are like, how is that even possible?
[03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:26.520]   It's like, well, go read about the terror that LBJ and the Kennedys and others had in
[03:14:26.520 --> 03:14:28.400]   confronting J. Edgar Hoover.
[03:14:28.400 --> 03:14:34.480]   Go and read how terrified, you know, Eisenhower and some of them were of the Dulles brothers.
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:35.480]   They were scared.
[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:37.240]   Like they knew where the power lies.
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:43.840]   So, you know, the presidency, look, government, deep state, et cetera, they've been there
[03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:46.320]   a long time and they know what's happening.
[03:14:46.320 --> 03:14:49.360]   And presidents come and go, but they stay forever.
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:53.920]   And so that's, that's the paradigm that you're going to have to fight against.
[03:14:53.920 --> 03:14:54.920]   Yeah.
[03:14:54.920 --> 03:15:00.880]   I mean, it's, it's a, it's a bit of a meme, but I wonder how deep the deep state is.
[03:15:00.880 --> 03:15:02.960]   Much deeper than anyone can even imagine.
[03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:06.480]   And the worst part is, but the deep state is it's not even individuals.
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:09.760]   It's actually an ideology and ideology is the most power.
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:13.720]   You know, people often think that if we took money out of politics, that it would change
[03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:14.720]   everything.
[03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:17.440]   I'm not saying it wouldn't change everything, but it wouldn't change a lot.
[03:15:17.440 --> 03:15:21.240]   People are like, Oh, so-and-so is only against universal healthcare because they're getting
[03:15:21.240 --> 03:15:22.240]   paid.
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:23.240]   I'm like, no, no, no, no.
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:24.240]   That's not why they actually believe it.
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:28.160]   Or it's like, Oh, so-and-so is only, Oh, wants to advocate for war with Iran because they're
[03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:29.280]   on the payroll of AIPAC.
[03:15:29.280 --> 03:15:33.760]   And it's like, well, yeah, the AIPAC trips and the money helps, but they think that actually
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:39.560]   the system itself, this is a very Chomsky ass systemic critique is that any journalist
[03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:43.640]   worth their salt would never have the ability to get hired in a mainstream.
[03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:46.640]   So he's like, it's not that you're bad in the mainstream media.
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:52.040]   It's that anyone good is not allowed to be elevated to your position because they have
[03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:53.240]   an ideology.
[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:58.800]   And so, you know, that is the most self-reinforcing pernicious mechanism of them all.
[03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:01.840]   And that's really Washington in a nutshell.
[03:16:01.840 --> 03:16:05.880]   It's a, it's again, a bubble, but a bubble that has a lot of power.
[03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:06.880]   Yes.
[03:16:06.880 --> 03:16:10.200]   Who do you think is the future of the Republican party after Trump?
[03:16:10.200 --> 03:16:12.880]   What happens to Trumpism after Trump?
[03:16:12.880 --> 03:16:16.580]   Like you just said, Bayesian, let's take various theories, right?
[03:16:16.580 --> 03:16:23.280]   So let's say it's '04, it's Bush Cheney in 2004, the day after the election, I would
[03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:26.600]   have told you this, we live in a Bible belt, Jesus land America.
[03:16:26.600 --> 03:16:34.800]   This America wants to protect America, a war on terror against Iraq and the axis of evil
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:37.560]   and American people just voted for George W. Bush.
[03:16:37.560 --> 03:16:41.440]   And so I would have predicted that it would have been somebody in that vein.
[03:16:41.440 --> 03:16:42.440]   And they tried that.
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:45.000]   John McCain, he got blown the fuck out by Barack Obama.
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.520]   So I cannot sit here and confidently say.
[03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:49.040]   What year would you be able to predict Obama?
[03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:53.240]   It was just his first time he gave the speech, the 2004 speech at the DNC.
[03:16:53.240 --> 03:16:58.040]   That was his, we don't live in a black America, white America, the John Kerry DNC speech.
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:02.880]   You honestly could not have predicted it until '07 whenever he actually announced his campaign
[03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:05.280]   and activated a lot of anti-war energy.
[03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:10.600]   I mean, maybe '06 actually, I could have said in '06, if I was, you know, kind of the contrarian
[03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:13.000]   man, now I'm like, yeah, there's a lot of anti-war energy.
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:16.800]   I think the next president will be somebody who's able to vote, you know, the explosion
[03:17:16.800 --> 03:17:21.360]   of Keith Olbermann and MSNBC that it makes logical sense in hindsight.
[03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:24.760]   But you know, at the same time, you're going up against the Clinton machine who's never
[03:17:24.760 --> 03:17:25.760]   lost an election.
[03:17:25.760 --> 03:17:28.520]   So I would have been afraid.
[03:17:28.520 --> 03:17:29.680]   I cannot confidently say.
[03:17:29.680 --> 03:17:34.920]   So I will say if things go in different directions, if Trump is a net positive president, then
[03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:41.000]   I think it will be J.D. Vance, his vice president, who believes in a lot of the things that I've
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:45.360]   talked about here today, about foreign policy restraint, about the working class, about
[03:17:45.360 --> 03:17:49.600]   changing Republican attitudes to the economy.
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:53.840]   And he would be able to build upon that legacy in the way that George H.W. Bush was able
[03:17:53.840 --> 03:17:55.920]   to get elected off the back of Reagan.
[03:17:55.920 --> 03:17:58.160]   But H.W. Bush was fundamentally his own man.
[03:17:58.160 --> 03:18:02.400]   He's a very misunderstood figure, very different than Ronald Reagan, didn't end up working
[03:18:02.400 --> 03:18:05.240]   out for him, but, you know, he did get himself elected once.
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:06.360]   So that's one path.
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:08.760]   That's if you have a net positive Trump presidency.
[03:18:08.760 --> 03:18:12.840]   The other path is the O4 path that I just laid out.
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:17.800]   If George H.W. Bush, if Trump does what Bush does, misinterprets his mandate, screws things
[03:18:17.800 --> 03:18:24.240]   up, creates chaos and makes it just generally annoying to live in American society, then
[03:18:24.240 --> 03:18:27.360]   you will see somebody in the Republican Party.
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:31.520]   I mean, still, it could even be J.D. Vance because he could say J.D. is my natural and
[03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:35.880]   my chosen successor, but then he would lose an election and then he would no longer be
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:38.400]   the so-called leader of the Republican Party.
[03:18:38.400 --> 03:18:41.480]   So I could see it swing in the other direction.
[03:18:41.480 --> 03:18:46.520]   I could see, you know, Republicans or others, let's say if it's a total disaster and we
[03:18:46.520 --> 03:18:51.880]   get down to like 20 percent approval ratings and the economy is bad and stuff like that,
[03:18:51.880 --> 03:18:58.600]   Glenn Youngkin or somebody like that who's very diametrically opposed to Donald Trump,
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:03.040]   or at least aesthetically, is somebody like that who could rise from the ashes.
[03:19:03.040 --> 03:19:06.400]   And I'm just saying like in terms of his aesthetic, not him per se.
[03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:09.160]   So there's a variety of different directions.
[03:19:09.160 --> 03:19:11.080]   It's a big question about the Republican base.
[03:19:11.080 --> 03:19:15.440]   I mean, a shit ton of people voted Republican now for the first time ever.
[03:19:15.440 --> 03:19:17.200]   So are they going to vote in party primaries?
[03:19:17.200 --> 03:19:18.200]   I don't know.
[03:19:18.200 --> 03:19:24.120]   You know, the traditional party primary voter is like a white boomer who's like 58, 59.
[03:19:24.120 --> 03:19:28.640]   Is the Latino guy in California who turned out to vote for Trump with a MAGA hat and
[03:19:28.640 --> 03:19:32.160]   rolling around, you know, suburban Los Angeles?
[03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:34.080]   With that, is he going to vote in the Republican Party?
[03:19:34.080 --> 03:19:35.080]   That could change.
[03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:37.040]   So the type of candidate themselves could come.
[03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:41.480]   So this is way too early to say, you know, we have so many variety of paths that we go
[03:19:41.480 --> 03:19:42.480]   down.
[03:19:42.480 --> 03:19:43.480]   Yeah.
[03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:52.600]   I think Trump is a singular figure in terms of like if you support Trump, I just, there's
[03:19:52.600 --> 03:19:59.440]   a vibe, I know Kamala has a vibe, but there's definitely a vibe to Trump and MAGA.
[03:19:59.440 --> 03:20:04.880]   And I just, I think even with J.D., that's no longer going to be there.
[03:20:04.880 --> 03:20:10.560]   So if J.D. runs and wins, that would be on principles and it's a very different human
[03:20:10.560 --> 03:20:11.560]   being.
[03:20:11.560 --> 03:20:13.280]   He is so different than Trump, right?
[03:20:13.280 --> 03:20:15.080]   You can see his empathy, right?
[03:20:15.080 --> 03:20:18.400]   Remember in the VP debate when he was like, "Christ have mercy," when Tim Wallace was
[03:20:18.400 --> 03:20:19.400]   talking about his son.
[03:20:19.400 --> 03:20:20.400]   That's not something Donald Trump would say.
[03:20:20.400 --> 03:20:21.400]   Okay, it's just not.
[03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:27.000]   Like in terms of, I mean, you know, and this, by the way, this is my own bubble test.
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:30.680]   I have no idea how somebody listens to Trump and J.D. Vance is like Trump is the guy who
[03:20:30.680 --> 03:20:32.160]   should be the president over him.
[03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:33.760]   I honestly, I don't get it.
[03:20:33.760 --> 03:20:34.920]   That's my own cards on the table.
[03:20:34.920 --> 03:20:43.200]   I am in too much of a bubble where I'm, my bias is to, you know, being well-spoken and
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:47.500]   being empathetic, or at least being able to play empathetic and being extremely well-read
[03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:52.120]   about the world and thoughtful and somebody who's, you know, somebody like him who's engaged
[03:20:52.120 --> 03:20:56.080]   in the political process, but also has been able to retain his values and be extremely
[03:20:56.080 --> 03:20:57.840]   well-articulate his worldview.
[03:20:57.840 --> 03:20:58.840]   That's my bias.
[03:20:58.840 --> 03:21:01.180]   That's who I would want to be the president.
[03:21:01.180 --> 03:21:03.280]   But you know, it's a big country.
[03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:04.280]   People think differently.
[03:21:04.280 --> 03:21:05.280]   By the way, I share your bias.
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:06.280]   Yeah.
[03:21:06.280 --> 03:21:08.240]   And I sometimes try to take myself out of that bubble.
[03:21:08.240 --> 03:21:15.160]   Like maybe it's not important to have read a book or multiples of books on history.
[03:21:15.160 --> 03:21:17.840]   I'm not saying everybody should be like me, but that's my point.
[03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:22.460]   I'm checking myself by being like, because of who I am, that's how I see the world.
[03:21:22.460 --> 03:21:24.240]   And that's how I would choose a leader.
[03:21:24.240 --> 03:21:27.520]   But that is not how people vote, period.
[03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:29.440]   Nothing has taught me that more than this election.
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:30.440]   I wish they did.
[03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:32.760]   I mean, I don't know if that, I don't know if that's the lesson to take away.
[03:21:32.760 --> 03:21:33.760]   I think.
[03:21:33.760 --> 03:21:34.760]   Yeah.
[03:21:34.760 --> 03:21:35.760]   But who are we to say?
[03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:36.760]   People are allowed to do what they want.
[03:21:36.760 --> 03:21:37.760]   I'm not going to tell somebody how to vote.
[03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:43.360]   No, what I'm saying is you take everything Trump, everything Trump is doing, everything,
[03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:50.800]   the whole, the dance, all of it, and add occasional saga, like references to history books.
[03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:52.520]   I think that's just a better candidate.
[03:21:52.520 --> 03:21:53.520]   I agree with you.
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:55.760]   I mean, listen, you know, it's my bias.
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:21:56.760]   Yeah.
[03:21:56.760 --> 03:21:57.760]   I don't know.
[03:21:57.760 --> 03:21:58.760]   I don't think that's biased.
[03:21:58.760 --> 03:22:01.200]   I think, I think that's not a bubble thinking.
[03:22:01.200 --> 03:22:02.200]   It's amazing to me.
[03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:03.200]   Right.
[03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:05.120]   Like, listen to the JD interview with Rogan.
[03:22:05.120 --> 03:22:12.820]   I mean, JD, I mean, he'll drop obscure references to studies, to like papers that have come
[03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:22.340]   out, essays, books, like this is a very well-read, high IQ, well-thought-out individual who also,
[03:22:22.340 --> 03:22:27.800]   you know, has given his life to the political process and decided to like deal with all
[03:22:27.800 --> 03:22:33.040]   the bullshit that this entire system is going to throw at you whenever you start to engage.
[03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:35.440]   That's who I would want to be president, but you know, I'm biased.
[03:22:35.440 --> 03:22:36.440]   So what can I say?
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:39.960]   I like how you keep saying you're biased as if there's some percent of the population
[03:22:39.960 --> 03:22:42.800]   doesn't like people to read at all.
[03:22:42.800 --> 03:22:44.060]   Okay.
[03:22:44.060 --> 03:22:45.060]   What about the future?
[03:22:45.060 --> 03:22:47.400]   You kind of hinted at it, the future of the democratic party.
[03:22:47.400 --> 03:22:48.400]   Yeah.
[03:22:48.400 --> 03:22:50.480]   Do you see any talent out there that's promising?
[03:22:50.480 --> 03:22:53.320]   Is it going to be Obama-like figure that just rolls out of nowhere?
[03:22:53.320 --> 03:22:59.620]   Clinton is the better example because the democratic party was destroyed for 12 years from 1980,
[03:22:59.620 --> 03:23:03.920]   the 1980 election to 1992, they're 12 years out of power.
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:10.380]   In periods of that long of an era, it takes somebody literally brand new who is not tainted
[03:23:10.380 --> 03:23:14.020]   by the previous to convince the base that you can won and convince the country that
[03:23:14.020 --> 03:23:15.640]   you're going in a new direction.
[03:23:15.640 --> 03:23:22.700]   So I would not put my money on anybody tainted by the great awokening, by TDS, by the insanity
[03:23:22.700 --> 03:23:23.700]   of the Trump era.
[03:23:23.700 --> 03:23:28.880]   It has to be somebody post that and/or somebody who is able to reform themselves.
[03:23:28.880 --> 03:23:36.120]   And in my opinion, it will likely not be any establishment politician of today who will
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:38.120]   emerge for the future.
[03:23:38.120 --> 03:23:39.720]   Like I said, my dark horse is Dean.
[03:23:39.720 --> 03:23:44.580]   I think the democratic base is going to give Dean a shit ton of credit and they should
[03:23:44.580 --> 03:23:45.580]   for him being out.
[03:23:45.580 --> 03:23:46.580]   Interesting.
[03:23:46.580 --> 03:23:47.580]   And look, let's be honest.
[03:23:47.580 --> 03:23:49.920]   He's a no-name congressman from Minnesota.
[03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:51.440]   Nobody cared who Dean Phillips was.
[03:23:51.440 --> 03:23:56.020]   But just like Obama, he had courage and he came out and spoke early when it mattered.
[03:23:56.020 --> 03:24:00.140]   And by doing that, he showed good judgment and he showed that he's willing to take risks.
[03:24:00.140 --> 03:24:03.860]   So I would hope in America's political system that we award something like that.
[03:24:03.860 --> 03:24:07.940]   And I do think the Democrats will reward him, but I'm not saying it will be him per se,
[03:24:07.940 --> 03:24:13.660]   but it will be a figure like that, who is not nationally known, who has read the tea
[03:24:13.660 --> 03:24:18.260]   leaves correctly, who took guesses and did things differently than everybody else.
[03:24:18.260 --> 03:24:25.140]   And most of all, I'm hoping that heterodox attitudes, ideas, behaviors by definition
[03:24:25.140 --> 03:24:28.360]   after a blowout, those will likely be the ones that are rewarded.
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:31.500]   So I cannot give a name, but I can just describe the circumstances for what it will look like.
[03:24:31.500 --> 03:24:36.260]   Can you imagine an amorphous figure that's a progressive populist?
[03:24:36.260 --> 03:24:41.220]   It would be very difficult at this point, just because a huge portion of the multiracial
[03:24:41.220 --> 03:24:45.660]   working class has shifted to the right, but I could see it.
[03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:48.020]   I mean, look, people change their minds all the time.
[03:24:48.020 --> 03:24:52.260]   Like there are people out there who voted for Barack Obama, who've now voted for Donald
[03:24:52.260 --> 03:24:53.260]   Trump three times.
[03:24:53.260 --> 03:24:55.940]   So, you know, a lot can change in this country.
[03:24:55.940 --> 03:25:00.660]   If you make a credible case, you've got a track record, speak authentically, and you
[03:25:00.660 --> 03:25:07.220]   can try to divide the country along class lines and be authentic and real about it.
[03:25:07.220 --> 03:25:08.220]   Maybe I think you have a shot.
[03:25:08.220 --> 03:25:12.420]   I still think you're probably gonna get dinged on culture, just because I think this election
[03:25:12.420 --> 03:25:15.220]   has really showed us how important immigration and culture is.
[03:25:15.220 --> 03:25:20.540]   But you know, actually what the left populace should pray for, and they won't admit this,
[03:25:20.540 --> 03:25:24.860]   is that Trump actually solves immigration, like in terms of changing the status quo.
[03:25:24.860 --> 03:25:29.700]   You know how in the way that the Supreme Court just ended the conversation around gay marriage?
[03:25:29.700 --> 03:25:32.540]   So Republicans were like, "Yeah, whatever, we support gay marriage."
[03:25:32.540 --> 03:25:35.180]   Because they're like, "That's the law of the land, it is what it is."
[03:25:35.180 --> 03:25:40.660]   They should just hope that their unpopular issue is resolved by the president, and thus
[03:25:40.660 --> 03:25:42.620]   they just don't have to talk about it anymore.
[03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:45.060]   And now the battleground is actually favorable for them.
[03:25:45.060 --> 03:25:46.980]   They get to talk about the economy and abortion.
[03:25:46.980 --> 03:25:53.140]   So their least popular issue gets solved by the president, by consensus, from his mandate,
[03:25:53.140 --> 03:25:56.940]   and then they can run on a brand new platform for the new issues that are facing America.
[03:25:56.940 --> 03:25:59.700]   All right, let's put our historian hat back on.
[03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:00.700]   Okay.
[03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:02.980]   Will the American empire collapse one day?
[03:26:02.980 --> 03:26:07.300]   And if it does, when it does, what will be the reason?
[03:26:07.300 --> 03:26:08.300]   Statistically, likely.
[03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:09.300]   Statistically, yes.
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:16.940]   You know, it's the famous Fight Club quote, it's like on a long enough timeline.
[03:26:16.940 --> 03:26:20.100]   The survival rate for everything drops to zero.
[03:26:20.100 --> 03:26:21.940]   And you know-
[03:26:21.940 --> 03:26:24.940]   I like for all the books you've quoted, you went to Fight Club.
[03:26:24.940 --> 03:26:26.260]   I guess the movie, right?
[03:26:26.260 --> 03:26:27.260]   The book's good though.
[03:26:27.260 --> 03:26:28.820]   People should read that too.
[03:26:28.820 --> 03:26:33.620]   In terms of why, again, statistically, the answer's quite simple.
[03:26:33.620 --> 03:26:42.100]   It usually comes back to a series of unpopular wars, which are pursued because of the elite's
[03:26:42.100 --> 03:26:50.780]   interests, then it usually leads to a miscalculation and not a catastrophic defeat normally.
[03:26:50.780 --> 03:26:54.060]   It comes gradually.
[03:26:54.060 --> 03:26:59.040]   And most of the times when these things end, the crazy part is most people who are living
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:02.500]   through end of empire have no idea that they're living through the end of the empire.
[03:27:02.500 --> 03:27:05.940]   And I actually think about that a lot from, you know, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
[03:27:05.940 --> 03:27:07.380]   by Edward Gibbon.
[03:27:07.380 --> 03:27:09.620]   Actually, your episode on Rome was fantastic.
[03:27:09.620 --> 03:27:10.620]   People should go listen to that.
[03:27:10.620 --> 03:27:11.780]   So there you go.
[03:27:11.780 --> 03:27:13.060]   Another really good one.
[03:27:13.060 --> 03:27:18.020]   I like to think a lot about the British Empire and what eventually led to that collapse.
[03:27:18.020 --> 03:27:23.300]   And nobody in 1919 said the British Empire has just collapsed.
[03:27:23.300 --> 03:27:24.620]   Basically nobody thought that.
[03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:28.420]   They were like, "Yeah, the First World War is horrible, but actually we came out of this
[03:27:28.420 --> 03:27:29.420]   okay.
[03:27:29.420 --> 03:27:30.420]   We still have India.
[03:27:30.420 --> 03:27:33.540]   You know, we still have all these African colonies and all that, but, you know, long
[03:27:33.540 --> 03:27:39.380]   periods of servitude, of debt to the United States, of degradation, of social upheaval,
[03:27:39.380 --> 03:27:43.220]   of Bolshevism, of American industrial might.
[03:27:43.220 --> 03:27:48.220]   And next thing you know, you find yourself at Potsdam and Churchill's like, "Holy shit,
[03:27:48.220 --> 03:27:51.020]   I have barely any power in this room," right?
[03:27:51.020 --> 03:27:54.520]   So revolutions happen slowly and then all at once.
[03:27:54.520 --> 03:27:59.380]   And so could you really put a, you know, a real like pin in the end of the British Empire?
[03:27:59.380 --> 03:28:01.860]   It took almost 40 years for it to end.
[03:28:01.860 --> 03:28:08.540]   So America's empire will eventually end either from rising geopolitical competition, likely
[03:28:08.540 --> 03:28:11.180]   China, could be India, nobody knows.
[03:28:11.180 --> 03:28:18.180]   It will likely be because of being overstretched, of an elite capture is usually the reason
[03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:26.020]   why, and a misreading of what made your original society work, you know, in the first place.
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:30.500]   And that is one where, honestly, like all three of those things will happen all at once
[03:28:30.500 --> 03:28:33.580]   and it will happen over an extremely long period of time.
[03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:35.580]   And it's very difficult to predict.
[03:28:35.580 --> 03:28:37.140]   I would not bet against America right now.
[03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:40.420]   I think we have a lot of fundamental strengths, which is a unique and dynamic country.
[03:28:40.420 --> 03:28:42.300]   It really is fucking crazy.
[03:28:42.300 --> 03:28:46.380]   Every time I travel the world, as much as I love all these different places, I go, "Man,
[03:28:46.380 --> 03:28:49.260]   I love the United States so much."
[03:28:49.260 --> 03:28:50.500]   You will love it more when you leave.
[03:28:50.500 --> 03:28:51.860]   I really believe that, so.
[03:28:51.860 --> 03:28:52.860]   Yeah.
[03:28:52.860 --> 03:28:53.860]   Yeah.
[03:28:53.860 --> 03:28:58.620]   And it's nice to remember how quickly the public opinion shifts, like we're very dynamic
[03:28:58.620 --> 03:29:01.020]   and adaptable, which annoys me.
[03:29:01.020 --> 03:29:05.100]   I understand that's part of the political discourse saying like, "If Trump wins, it's
[03:29:05.100 --> 03:29:06.100]   the end of America.
[03:29:06.100 --> 03:29:07.940]   If Kamala wins, it's the end of America."
[03:29:07.940 --> 03:29:08.940]   So stupid.
[03:29:08.940 --> 03:29:09.940]   Yeah.
[03:29:09.940 --> 03:29:10.940]   So dumb.
[03:29:10.940 --> 03:29:14.940]   But I understand that the radical nature of that discourse is necessary to, like we mentioned-
[03:29:14.940 --> 03:29:15.940]   Yeah, to drive out votes.
[03:29:15.940 --> 03:29:17.380]   To drive up votes.
[03:29:17.380 --> 03:29:19.740]   I like to think about Americans in 1866.
[03:29:19.740 --> 03:29:23.220]   I cannot imagine going through a war where some X percent, I think it was like two or
[03:29:23.220 --> 03:29:26.500]   three percent or whatever, the entire population was just killed.
[03:29:26.500 --> 03:29:31.660]   Our president, who was this visionary genius who we're blessed to have, is assassinated
[03:29:31.660 --> 03:29:35.340]   at Forks Theater immediately after the surrender of Lee.
[03:29:35.340 --> 03:29:40.820]   Andrew Johnson, who's a bumbling fucktard, is the one who is in charge.
[03:29:40.820 --> 03:29:46.460]   We're having all these insane crises over internal management while we're also trying
[03:29:46.460 --> 03:29:52.820]   to decide this new order in the South and how to bring these people back into the union.
[03:29:52.820 --> 03:29:53.820]   I would have despaired.
[03:29:53.820 --> 03:29:56.380]   I'm like, "It's over.
[03:29:56.380 --> 03:29:57.380]   This is it."
[03:29:57.380 --> 03:30:01.780]   The war, I'm like, "Was it worth anything if Andrew Johnson is going to be doing this?"
[03:30:01.780 --> 03:30:02.780]   Or even in the South.
[03:30:02.780 --> 03:30:06.460]   I mean, I can't even imagine for what they were going through too.
[03:30:06.460 --> 03:30:09.320]   They have to go home and their entire cities are burned to the ground and they're trying
[03:30:09.320 --> 03:30:15.180]   to readjust and their entire economy and way of life is overthrown in five years.
[03:30:15.180 --> 03:30:17.300]   That's an insane time to be alive.
[03:30:17.300 --> 03:30:18.300]   And what do we know?
[03:30:18.300 --> 03:30:19.620]   It worked out.
[03:30:19.620 --> 03:30:26.780]   By 1890s or so, there were people shaking hands, union, and there's a cool video on
[03:30:26.780 --> 03:30:32.500]   YouTube actually of FDR who is addressing some of the last Gettysburg veterans.
[03:30:32.500 --> 03:30:35.100]   I think it was like the 75th anniversary or whatever.
[03:30:35.100 --> 03:30:39.780]   And you can literally see these old men who are shaking hands across the stone wall.
[03:30:39.780 --> 03:30:41.740]   It gives me hope, yeah.
[03:30:41.740 --> 03:30:43.540]   Let's linger on that hope.
[03:30:43.540 --> 03:30:51.580]   What is the source of optimism you have for the 21st century, for the century beyond that,
[03:30:51.580 --> 03:30:55.100]   for human civilization in general?
[03:30:55.100 --> 03:30:59.740]   It's easy to learn cynical lessons from history, right?
[03:30:59.740 --> 03:31:02.260]   That shit eventually goes wrong.
[03:31:02.260 --> 03:31:04.320]   But sometimes it doesn't.
[03:31:04.320 --> 03:31:06.220]   So what gives you hope?
[03:31:06.220 --> 03:31:14.060]   I think that the fundamentals of what makes humanity great and has for a long time are
[03:31:14.060 --> 03:31:17.380]   best expressed in the American character.
[03:31:17.380 --> 03:31:23.340]   And that despite all of our problems, that as a country with our ethos, a lot of stuff
[03:31:23.340 --> 03:31:28.220]   we've talked about today, individualism, the frontier mindset, the blessings of geography,
[03:31:28.220 --> 03:31:33.060]   the blessings of our economy, of the way that we're able to just incorporate different cultures
[03:31:33.060 --> 03:31:38.760]   and the best of each and put them all together, give us the best opportunity to succeed and
[03:31:38.760 --> 03:31:41.100]   to accomplish awesome things.
[03:31:41.100 --> 03:31:45.340]   We're the country that put a man on the moon, which is the epitome of human spirit.
[03:31:45.340 --> 03:31:48.260]   I hope to see more of that.
[03:31:48.260 --> 03:31:52.100]   And I think last time I was here, I shouted out, and I love Antarctic exploration.
[03:31:52.100 --> 03:31:55.900]   I've read basically every book that there is on the exploration of Antarctica.
[03:31:55.900 --> 03:32:00.900]   And one of the reasons I love to do so is because there is no reason to care about Antarctica.
[03:32:00.900 --> 03:32:01.900]   None.
[03:32:01.900 --> 03:32:02.900]   There's nothing down there.
[03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:03.900]   Zero.
[03:32:03.900 --> 03:32:07.280]   Going to the South Pole is a truly useless exercise.
[03:32:07.280 --> 03:32:09.820]   And yet we went.
[03:32:09.820 --> 03:32:10.860]   We went twice, actually.
[03:32:10.860 --> 03:32:15.020]   Two people went there within the span of five weeks, and they competed to do so.
[03:32:15.020 --> 03:32:21.300]   And the spirit that propelled Amundsen and Scott's expedition and people like Shackleton
[03:32:21.300 --> 03:32:26.260]   who was like, if you were to ask me, my hero of all heroes, it's Ernest Shackleton, is
[03:32:26.260 --> 03:32:30.260]   because his spirit, I think, lives on in the United States.
[03:32:30.260 --> 03:32:32.460]   It unfortunately died in Great Britain.
[03:32:32.460 --> 03:32:35.580]   And interestingly enough, the Brits even understand that.
[03:32:35.580 --> 03:32:39.100]   They're like, it's very interesting how popular Shackleton is in America.
[03:32:39.100 --> 03:32:44.820]   And even though he was Irish and he was a British subject, to me, he's a spiritual American.
[03:32:44.820 --> 03:32:50.380]   And I think that his spirit lives on within us and has always been here to a certain extent.
[03:32:50.380 --> 03:32:52.940]   And everywhere else, I think it's dying.
[03:32:52.940 --> 03:32:55.700]   But here, I love it here.
[03:32:55.700 --> 03:32:56.900]   There's so many cool things about America.
[03:32:56.900 --> 03:32:58.020]   People move around all the time.
[03:32:58.020 --> 03:32:59.020]   They buy new houses.
[03:32:59.020 --> 03:33:00.780]   They start families.
[03:33:00.780 --> 03:33:02.340]   There's no other place you can just reset your whole life.
[03:33:02.340 --> 03:33:04.540]   In the same country, it's wild.
[03:33:04.540 --> 03:33:05.820]   You can reinvent yourself.
[03:33:05.820 --> 03:33:06.820]   You can go broke.
[03:33:06.820 --> 03:33:07.820]   You can get rich.
[03:33:07.820 --> 03:33:10.160]   You can go back and forth multiple times.
[03:33:10.160 --> 03:33:15.060]   And there's nowhere else where you have enough freedom and opportunity to pursue that.
[03:33:15.060 --> 03:33:18.820]   And we definitely have a lot of problems, but I've traveled enough of the world now
[03:33:18.820 --> 03:33:21.340]   to know that it's a special place.
[03:33:21.340 --> 03:33:22.740]   And that gives me a lot of hope.
[03:33:22.740 --> 03:33:27.940]   I wish I could do a Bostonian accent of, we do these things, not because they're easy,
[03:33:27.940 --> 03:33:28.940]   but because they're hard.
[03:33:28.940 --> 03:33:29.940]   Yes, but because they're hard.
[03:33:29.940 --> 03:33:30.940]   Thank you.
[03:33:30.940 --> 03:33:31.940]   Yeah.
[03:33:31.940 --> 03:33:32.940]   Oh, that's so true.
[03:33:32.940 --> 03:33:35.300]   The Scott Irish got us.
[03:33:35.300 --> 03:33:36.300]   Yeah.
[03:33:36.300 --> 03:33:39.180]   Well, listen, I'm a huge fan of your saga.
[03:33:39.180 --> 03:33:43.580]   I hope to see you in the White House interviewing the president.
[03:33:43.580 --> 03:33:44.580]   Yeah, there you go.
[03:33:44.580 --> 03:33:45.580]   That's right.
[03:33:45.580 --> 03:33:49.500]   In that situation, you're going to see me in the White House.
[03:33:49.500 --> 03:33:54.220]   Front row and just talking free.
[03:33:54.220 --> 03:34:01.700]   I would love to live in a country and in a world where it's you who gets to talk to the
[03:34:01.700 --> 03:34:08.220]   press secretary, to the president, because I think you're one of the good ones, as far
[03:34:08.220 --> 03:34:09.980]   as journalists go, as far as human beings.
[03:34:09.980 --> 03:34:11.700]   So I hope to see you in there.
[03:34:11.700 --> 03:34:15.620]   And I hope you get to ask a question that-
[03:34:15.620 --> 03:34:16.620]   That ends up in a book.
[03:34:16.620 --> 03:34:18.380]   ... that ends up in a good history book.
[03:34:18.380 --> 03:34:19.380]   Absolutely.
[03:34:19.380 --> 03:34:21.380]   Well, likewise, I'm a huge fan of yours.
[03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:25.220]   For anybody out there who's interested, I compiled a list and I will go and retroactively
[03:34:25.220 --> 03:34:26.220]   edit it.
[03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:27.220]   Just go to sagaandjetty.io.
[03:34:27.220 --> 03:34:31.900]   I created a newsletter with a website that has all the links to all the books I'm going
[03:34:31.900 --> 03:34:32.900]   to talk about here.
[03:34:32.900 --> 03:34:33.900]   Beautiful.
[03:34:33.900 --> 03:34:34.900]   The hundreds of books that were mentioned here.
[03:34:34.900 --> 03:34:37.860]   All right, brother, thank you so much for talking to me.
[03:34:37.860 --> 03:34:38.860]   Thank you.
[03:34:38.860 --> 03:34:41.580]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sagar and Jetty.
[03:34:41.580 --> 03:34:45.420]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:34:45.420 --> 03:34:49.500]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Voltaire.
[03:34:49.500 --> 03:34:54.260]   History is the study of all the world's crime.
[03:34:54.260 --> 03:34:55.260]   Thank you for listening.
[03:34:55.260 --> 03:34:57.300]   I hope to see you next time.
[03:34:57.300 --> 03:34:58.300]   Bye-bye.
[03:34:58.300 --> 03:34:58.300]   Bye-bye.
[03:34:58.300 --> 03:34:59.300]   Bye-bye.
[03:34:59.300 --> 03:34:59.300]   Bye-bye.
[03:34:59.300 --> 03:35:04.300]   Bye-bye.
[03:35:04.300 --> 03:35:09.300]   Bye-bye.
