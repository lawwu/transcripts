[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   - So let's talk about linear algebra a little bit,
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.280]   'cause it is such a, it's both a powerful
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.780]   and a beautiful subfield of mathematics.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.780]   So what's your favorite specific topic in linear algebra,
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.280]   or even math in general, to give a lecture on,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.900]   to convey, to tell a story, to teach students?
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.140]   - Okay, well, on the teaching side,
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.480]   so it's not deep mathematics at all,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   but I'm kind of proud of the idea of the four subspaces,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.860]   the four fundamental subspaces,
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.320]   which are, of course, known before,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.360]   long before my name for them, but--
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   - Can you go through them?
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.200]   Can you go through the four subspaces?
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.680]   - Sure I can, yeah.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.320]   So the first one to understand is,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   so the matrix, maybe I should say the matrix--
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.440]   - What is a matrix?
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.520]   - What's a matrix?
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.160]   Well, so we have like a rectangle of numbers.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.920]   So it's got N columns, got a bunch of columns,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.200]   and also got an M rows, let's say,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.240]   and the relation between, so of course,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.280]   the columns and the rows, it's the same numbers.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.040]   So there's gotta be connections there,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.520]   but they're not simple.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.760]   The columns might be longer than the rows,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.400]   and they're all different, the numbers are mixed up.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.440]   First space to think about is, take the columns,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.560]   so those are vectors, those are points in N dimensions.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.400]   - What's a vector?
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.360]   - So a physicist would imagine a vector,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   or might imagine a vector as a arrow in space,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.520]   or the point it ends at in space.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.980]   For me, it's a column of numbers.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.640]   - You often think of, this is very interesting
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   in terms of linear algebra, in terms of a vector.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.360]   You think a little bit more abstract
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.240]   than how it's very commonly used, perhaps.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.400]   You think this arbitrary multidimensional space--
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.880]   - Right away, I'm in high dimensions.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.720]   - Dreamland.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.120]   - Yeah, that's right, in the lecture, I try to,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.440]   so if you think of two vectors in 10 dimensions,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.120]   I'll do this in class, and I'll readily admit
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.040]   that I have no good image in my mind
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.920]   of a vector, of a arrow in 10 dimensional space,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.900]   but whatever.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.440]   You can add one bunch of 10 numbers
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.000]   to another bunch of 10 numbers,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.720]   so you can add a vector to a vector,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.980]   and you can multiply a vector by three,
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.840]   and that's, if you know how to do those,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.760]   you've got linear algebra.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.400]   - You know, 10 dimensions.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.240]   - Yeah.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.560]   - You know, there's this beautiful thing about math,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.360]   if we look at string theory, and all these theories
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.120]   which are really fundamentally derived through math,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.160]   but are very difficult to visualize.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.540]   How do you think about the things,
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.800]   like a 10 dimensional vector,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.640]   that we can't really visualize?
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   - Yeah.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.000]   - Do you, and yet, math reveals some beauty--
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.480]   - Oh, great beauty. - Underlying our world
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   in that weird thing we can't visualize.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   How do you think about that difference?
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.600]   - Well, probably, I'm not a very geometric person,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.400]   so I'm probably thinking in three dimensions,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640]   and the beauty of linear algebra is that
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.880]   it goes on to 10 dimensions with no problem.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.920]   I mean, if you're just seeing what happens
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.280]   if you add two vectors in 3D,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.400]   yeah, then you can add them in 10D.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.560]   You're just adding the 10 components.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.520]   So I can't say that I have a picture,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   but yet I try to push the class
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.880]   to think of a flat surface in 10 dimensions.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.080]   So a plane in 10 dimensions,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.840]   and so that's one of the spaces.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.560]   Take all the columns of the matrix,
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.480]   take all their combinations,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.840]   so much of this column, so much of this one,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.480]   then if you put all those together,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.600]   you get some kind of a flat surface
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.360]   that I call a vector space, space of vectors,
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.920]   and my imagination is just seeing
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.920]   like a piece of paper in 3D.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.280]   But anyway, so that's one of the spaces,
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.120]   that's space number one, the column space of the matrix.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.720]   And then there's the row space,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.840]   which is, as I said, different,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.400]   but came from the same numbers.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.760]   So we got the column space,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.720]   all combinations of the columns,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.640]   and then we got the row space,
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.240]   all combinations of the rows.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.200]   So those words are easy for me to say,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.920]   and I can't really draw them on a blackboard,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.200]   but I try with my thick chalk.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.040]   Everybody likes that railroad chalk, and me too.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.920]   I wouldn't use anything else now.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.720]   And then the other two spaces are perpendicular to those.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.760]   So like if you have a plane in 3D,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.200]   just a plane is just a flat surface in 3D,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.760]   then perpendicular to that plane would be a line.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.920]   So that would be the null space.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.720]   So we've got two, we've got a column space, a row space,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.640]   and there are two perpendicular spaces.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.440]   So those four fit together
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.200]   in a beautiful picture of a matrix.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.080]   Yeah, yeah, it's sort of a fundamental,
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.440]   it's not a difficult idea.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.960]   It comes pretty early in 1806, and it's basic.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
