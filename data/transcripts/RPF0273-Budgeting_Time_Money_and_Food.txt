[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.320]   Today on Radical Personal Finance we're going to talk about budgeting.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.520]   Oh you know what they say about budgeting?
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.720]   The dreaded B word.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.360]   Man I hate that joke.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.440]   I despise that joke.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   Do me a favor please.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.360]   There are very few jokes that you can say around me that make me really angry, but that
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.520]   one does.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.600]   I cannot stand the negative attitude that so many people seem to have about budgeting
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.520]   and it's perpetuated with stupid jokes like that one.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.440]   Because here's my contention, and I say this without reservation period.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.080]   Budgeting has the opportunity to change every single aspect of your life.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.240]   If you understand what budgeting is, how it works, the progressions of budgeting, and
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:43.320]   the areas to which you should apply the concept.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.360]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.400]   I'm excited about today's show because some of the concepts that I have to share with
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.840]   you I believe will bring some real clarity to the conversation around budgeting.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.360]   Today I'm going to give you a framework for budgeting, how you can apply it to your life,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.960]   and yes I really do believe that this show has the opportunity, the potential to change
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.640]   your life.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.280]   People argue about, well they, oh okay.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.160]   People argue about everything.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.760]   People who care about finance argue about everything finance related and budgeting is
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.280]   one of the sources of arguments that people love to argue about.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.440]   Talk about different ways and different approaches and things like that.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.640]   Yes, hey, we can argue about stuff.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.680]   I like a good argument sometimes.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.480]   Budgeting is one of those things that you can't really get around and even the people
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   who think they're getting around it, "I don't budget.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.560]   I don't need to budget."
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.400]   They're getting around it without actually getting around it.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.200]   I hope that that becomes very clear to you in today's show that even the people who say
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.520]   they don't budget, they really are when we understand and expand our definition of budgeting.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.920]   My intent in today's show is to share some ideas and some thoughts with you that I think
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.880]   will maybe help to bring people together on the subject of budgeting because I've been
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.960]   there, done that, tried different things, seen different things.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.400]   Today, I'm going to share with you a continuum of budgeting approaches that I think will
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.320]   be helpful for you.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.760]   You would never run a business without having a budget of some kind and having some sort
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.240]   of controls on your finances or at least you wouldn't run such a business and expect it
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.340]   to stay in business.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.360]   In fact, if you trace the problems of business bankruptcy, many times you're going to find
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.480]   that often the budgeting system and the control system and the feedback mechanisms weren't
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.920]   responding fast enough to be able to help the business owner and the entrepreneur to
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.320]   be able to make good decisions.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   Now, they may – the fault is not always the budgeting system, but the budgeting system
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.960]   is going to be in there somewhere.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.080]   So why would you run your life any differently?
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.960]   Well, you would say because money is not everything.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.960]   You're right.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.000]   And that's why today I want to talk about budgeting in an expansive concept beyond just
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   money.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.320]   See, there are very few times I make absolute statements because there are very few things
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.340]   in finance that are absolute.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.400]   But here's an absolute statement for you.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.080]   I can't come up with a single valid argument not to have a system of financial tracking,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.200]   budgeting and control if you are interested in building wealth.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.920]   And furthermore, the better your system of financial tracking, budgeting and control,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.600]   the more efficient your wealth plan will be.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.400]   Now the cool thing is that principle is applicable to money and money is a great thing to talk
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.480]   about because it's easily measured.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   It's easily denominated.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.640]   It's a great scorecard.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.380]   But obviously money is not the central focus of life.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.840]   Money is simply a tool to fund the central themes of life.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:20.600]   And so that statement can and should and we will today be applied to other areas including
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.660]   time and food because the budgeting principles apply to each area of life and the process
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.660]   is the same.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.240]   So there are probably other areas we could apply it to.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.640]   But I want to talk today about the three major budgets that we need to have in our life.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.320]   And those three budgets are a budget for our time, a budget for our food intake and a budget
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   for our money.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.640]   Now you could again expand this feel free.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.880]   You could have a budget for our physical activity or have a budget for our emotional energy.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.000]   Run with this as far as you want.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.040]   But today I just want to talk about three budgets.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.280]   Hat tip to Gary North who was the first person years ago when I was reading his site and
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.920]   he talked about the three major budgets and it's like time, food and money.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.880]   I said, "Wow, that's exactly right."
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   Hat tip to him for originally years ago giving me the idea of three budgets.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.080]   But today I've expanded the idea and we're going to go beyond that.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.280]   I want to share with you the importance of these three major budgets and how they are
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   going to impact your life.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.960]   I want to share with you the three major stages of budgeting through which people go.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.200]   And the key thing here is this is where all the arguments come from.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   This is where people argue, "Well, your budgeting system is stink because you use credit cards
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.800]   and you run it through Mint.com and I use cash envelopes."
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   This is all a matter of understanding what stage you're at.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.120]   I want to share with you the major ideas that are applicable to every type of budgeting
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.120]   and some truths.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.080]   I'm going to talk about some tools, basically the types of tools that you need for different
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.560]   types of budgeting and then some tools that will give you options.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.080]   And hopefully at the end of today's show, if I've done my job, I will have number one
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.080]   sold you on the concept of budgeting.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.060]   I will also, number two, have given you a way to assess your own personal budgeting
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.040]   system and perhaps discussed some tools that could be helpful to you as you move on to
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.720]   the next stage.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.780]   And so that's the major content of today's show.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.720]   Before I start walking through that content, I want to share with you the sponsors of today's
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   show.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.400]   Sponsor of the day, number one today is Jay Fleischman and the Student Loan Show.

[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.120]   That's basically the deal.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.400]   So if you have student loans, may I make a recommendation?
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   As I record this show, it's December 2015.

[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.440]   If you have student loans, especially if you have big student loans and especially if you
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.720]   have student loans that are in some stage of controversy, you're falling behind, you're

[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.960]   I should do the radio voice.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.080]   Sponsor of the day number two today is Patrick Snow.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.200]   Patrick is actually my personal publishing coach and we're making good progress on the
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.440]   manuscript of Radical Personal Finance book.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.120]   In fact, today's show, some of the content, this is the type of thing that's in the book,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   the outline of the subject.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.800]   This comes from part of my manuscript of my ideas on budgeting.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.560]   But Patrick has been instrumental to me in helping me navigate the process of publishing
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.040]   but in addition to that, the business of coaching, speaking, basically being an expert in the
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.220]   expert economy.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.440]   He is excellent at that but he has a special skill set in the area of publishing.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.080]   If you don't have a book, why not?
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.720]   Have you ever thought of one?
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.440]   Well, if so, get started.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.200]   Talk to Patrick and check him out at thepublishingdoctor.com, thepublishingdoctor.com.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   All right.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   Let's talk budgeting.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.640]   Today, first, I want to sell you on the impact that budgeting can make and why it can affect
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.040]   your results and then we'll go into the stages of budgeting.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.960]   I want to start not with money, not even with time but actually with food.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:00.200]   I want to use food as a good concept or a good metaphor to illustrate the concepts.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.720]   Think of the people in the world whose bodies are instrumental in their success.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.680]   So here I'm thinking of athletes and ask yourself this question.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:20.720]   Do you think that a highly skilled, highly advanced athlete would have a plan with regard
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.320]   to their food intake?
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.480]   It's almost inconceivable that they wouldn't, right?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.720]   Think about somebody like a bodybuilder preparing for a bodybuilding competition.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.880]   A bodybuilder, they've got everything mapped out.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.200]   They know exactly what they're going to eat.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.160]   They know exactly the time that they're going to eat it and depending on the type of competition,
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.120]   maybe they've got four containers of chicken breast and green beans planned out and everything
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.280]   divided up.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.200]   Maybe they're waking up in the middle of the night to slam down their ice cream smoothie
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.960]   with extra calories so that they can gain the weight they're trying to gain.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.740]   They've got their supplements lined up.
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.080]   Somebody who's preparing for a marathon, they've got their supplements.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.400]   They've got their schedule figured out.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.680]   They've got their carbohydrate and protein intake carefully mapped out.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.460]   An Olympic athlete, everything is planned on a careful program and the higher the level
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:20.000]   of performance that you need to go, the more important that plan is.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Are there exceptions to that rule?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.640]   I would say yes, there are.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.760]   In fact, the exceptions generally in this case prove the rule.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.420]   The only exception that comes to mind right now is I remember when Michael Phelps was
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.480]   competing at the Olympics, Michael Phelps was the Olympic swimmer.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.680]   I read an article about how he just eats like a maniac and eats all kinds of different things
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.280]   because he's in the pool so much.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   He's swimming constantly.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.600]   He's got to scarf down all the information.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.800]   He's eating all the food that he can possibly stuff in.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.160]   It's thousands and thousands and thousands of calories per day.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.760]   Sometimes the sources were clean and sometimes the sources were not.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.360]   The reason that he was able to do that though was because of all of the activity on the
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.440]   other side, which is why when we talk about wealth planning and you see somebody who is
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.760]   earning millions of dollars a year and is only comparing it to the fact that him swimming
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.560]   hours and hours and hours a day and then just scarfing and then him scarfing down calories,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.640]   well, if you're not swimming hours and hours a day, you can't just scarf down the 6,000
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   calories a day.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.700]   In the same way that if you're not earning millions of dollars a year, you can't waste
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.880]   hundreds of thousands of dollars per year like you might see some celebrity or star
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   doing.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.800]   It catches up to you.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   Now, do elite athletes reach their level of eliteness and then start budgeting or do they
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.960]   budget along the way?
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.840]   Now here for the sake of my illustration, let's focus on something that's very physical
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.520]   related to the body, something like bodybuilding.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.060]   Ignore for a moment basic athletic skill.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.720]   Just talk about bodybuilding.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.140]   Does an elite bodybuilder budget only after they become elite or did the fact that they
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.340]   budgeted allow them to become elite?
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.420]   I would argue that generally it's the latter.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.100]   Usually those little disciplines that started when they were a scrawny high school student
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.620]   and wanted to start building their muscles, those little disciplines, learning how to
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.140]   eat, learning how the process, learning how their body responded to different things,
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.100]   learning what was right for them, that's what allows them to go to the elite levels.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.900]   Then they hone and refine their skill over time.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:32.660]   That's a really good example because what it shows is that – it shows that the skills
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.700]   build the platform for somebody to go on and do later.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:43.280]   Now there are people who have natural talent or who have a natural genetic ability over
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   somebody else.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.180]   Well, the same thing happens in money.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.060]   There are people who get lucky.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.680]   There are people who hit it rich unexpectedly.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.700]   But somebody with good genetics and a bad food budget is not going to win a competition.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:03.300]   Somebody with bad genetics, so-called, and a great food budget might win a competition.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.340]   Think about it and how that applies to money.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:12.020]   One more point on the food and we'll be off of it is recognize literally how big of
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.140]   a difference food makes, going away from athletes, in the lives of the common everyday man and
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.100]   woman.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.620]   Our level of performance is going to be driven by the quality and kinds of foods that we
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.780]   eat.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.220]   Our level of – the amount of work that we can put out, the amount of focus, the amount
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:36.460]   of clarity, the quality and length of our life is going to be driven by the amount of
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.840]   food that we eat.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.640]   So I was using the athlete metaphor to talk about growth into elite levels, which will
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.180]   be especially important when we talk about when we switch to money and time.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.460]   But just simply recognize that I'm literally talking about having a plan for food.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:59.580]   I just – night before last was helping somebody move and this person was moving into a home
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.580]   of a relative.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:06.020]   I walked into the home of the relative and this was an older, sick person's house.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.940]   I had never met the person before.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:15.380]   But the wife was lying in a chair, obviously very sick and she was overweight.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.840]   She had – I don't know if she had medical equipment around her.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.640]   She was obviously not very mobile, lying in a chair, very sick.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.060]   The whole house had that sick smell to it.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:36.140]   Then the husband was moving around, hobbling around with a walker and he was very obese
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.580]   and just looked very unhealthy.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.620]   The whole house kind of had that sick old person smell.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.140]   Now I don't know the circumstances of the health condition.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.100]   I didn't ask and obviously I don't know the details.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.700]   So this is a little bit of premature judging.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.500]   But as I walked through the kitchen, I was just struck by the food that was sitting on
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.500]   the counter.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.000]   There were crumb cakes and donuts and just – it was bread.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.260]   It was sugary bread of about ten different varieties all partially consumed.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.900]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.560]   There was nothing green.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.620]   There was nothing with nutrients.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:19.200]   It was all sugary breads in some state of consumption, way more than even a family of
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.980]   many people should eat one of them and yet there were only two people in the house and
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.180]   they were all partially eaten.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.180]   I said, "Hmm."
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.660]   My heart went out to them and I didn't have opportunity to ask any questions nor was it
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   my place.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.180]   But I just thought, "Are they sick because of this or are they eating this way because
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.180]   they're sick?
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.180]   Who knows?"
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.580]   But the same thing happens in money and in time.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.020]   That's why budgeting is so important.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.180]   The person wastes money.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.980]   Are they poor because they waste money or are they wasting money because they're poor?
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.460]   The person isn't productive with their life.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:57.220]   Are they unproductive because they're wasting time or you get the point?
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.260]   So we've got to pay attention to each of these budgets.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.860]   The major budget I think that will make the biggest difference in how our life turns out
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:09.460]   is how we budget our time because the things that we budget our time to do, that's the
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.460]   stuff of life.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.980]   Time is the stuff of life.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.460]   Number two is probably food and number three is probably money if I had to put a priority
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.280]   on them.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.140]   So what do we actually do?
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.300]   Let's talk about the stages of budgeting that I think are important.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.260]   I think there are three major stages of budgeting.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:34.300]   If you are getting the results that you're happy with, you may not need to change anything.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.580]   Life is not always about constantly changing everything again and again and again and again.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.900]   This question is are you happy with the results?
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.080]   And if you're happy with them, just go with what you're doing.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.700]   But if you're not completely satisfied with your results in some area, I think there are
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.420]   some stages that you can apply.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.540]   Stage number one is awareness.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:18:02.140]   Start with awareness of what's actually happening.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.140]   In food, if you were working with a diet consultant, the first thing they would do is provide and
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.580]   ask you to have some mechanism of tracking your food, whether that's keeping a diet log
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.460]   and writing down the things that you eat, whether that's taking a picture with your
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:22.060]   phone of everything that you eat, some mechanism of recording so that you can become aware
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.820]   of what's going through your body.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.500]   If you were working with a productivity coach, the first thing that productivity coach would
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.860]   ask you to do is become aware of what you're spending your time doing.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.260]   Where are you actually – where is it going?
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.260]   What are you actually doing?
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.260]   Again, an app on your phone, an app on your computer, tracking the time on your computer
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.780]   and on your phone to figure out what you're actually spending your time on, a written
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:53.620]   journal of some kind, anything to gain some level of awareness.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.260]   And then finally with budgeting, same thing.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.580]   If you were talking with me, the first thing I'm going to find out is where is your money
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.580]   going?
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.220]   We have to have a system of tracking and being aware of where your money is going.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.540]   That's stage one.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.500]   Stage one, awareness.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.780]   Stage two of making major change is proactive planning or proactive allocation.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.180]   There's a caveat.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:22.820]   It has to be proactive planning, proactive allocation with an appropriate level of detail.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.620]   That little caveat with an appropriate level of detail is very subjective and it's very
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.980]   subjective based upon what you're trying to do.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.660]   If you're trying to win a bodybuilding competition, you're going to track every one of your macros
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.940]   and you're going to have them every single day recorded.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.000]   If on the other hand, you're just trying to live a normal life, you don't need such an
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.220]   obsessive level of detail.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.180]   Same thing with regard to finance.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:53.900]   There are times at which very, very specific and careful detail is important.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:59.020]   There are times where just big picture allocation and proactive planning is all you need.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.860]   The concept is the same.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.260]   Nutrition coach says, "Hey, let's adjust your food.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.100]   Here are the foods I want you to eat more of.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.300]   Here are the foods I want you to eat less of."
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.100]   Or "Hey, you've got terminal cancer.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.420]   Okay, this is what you're allowed to eat."
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:19.700]   There's a food place near my house, world famous, called Hippocrates Health Institute.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.380]   People come in from all over the world who are in end stage cancer and just very difficult
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.380]   situations.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.980]   Some people that just want to live a healthy life and they come in for intensive nutritional
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.980]   treatments.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.980]   Man, their level of the stuff, I've gone there for lunch.
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.980]   Everything's raw.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.980]   Everything's green.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.700]   It's crazy when you really look at it.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.340]   But the level of specificity of the things you must eat, the things you must not eat
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.300]   is hardcore.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.820]   But they're working with people who are looking for hardcore extreme results.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.500]   So proactive planning with appropriate detail.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.780]   Same applies to time.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.540]   Same applies to money.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:05.820]   The third stage is we need a system of ongoing controls with an appropriate level of relaxation.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:10.820]   Whatever the category of life, whatever the system, we must have some kind of ongoing
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.160]   feedback loop.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.460]   That feedback loop can be very simple or it can be very complex.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.280]   But it's got to be a livable level of feedback loop.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.060]   So three major stages of budgeting.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.060]   Number one, awareness.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.340]   Number two, proactive planning with appropriate level of detail.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:33.260]   And number three, ongoing controls with an appropriate level of relaxation.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:40.380]   Let me sketch out the framework for you and I'll give some very specific monetary examples.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.260]   Before I do that though, I believe there are some major ideas that are consistent across
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.780]   all these different types of budgeting, all these different kinds of allocation.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:55.300]   First, great results come from having clear goals.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.420]   Nutrition coach, what are you trying to do?
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.580]   I just want to lose five or 10 pounds and feel better.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.540]   Or I want to win Mr. Olympia.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.540]   Very different process.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.060]   But we've got to start with clear goals and the goals inform everything.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.420]   Yeah, Joshua, I'd just like to get out of debt, live a normal lifestyle, save a little
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.660]   bit of money and focus on just hanging out with my friends and doing things I love.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.060]   Joshua, I want to retire in five years.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.620]   Okay.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.100]   Or Joshua, I want to be a mega billionaire.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.260]   Okay.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.260]   Different plan.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.060]   The plan is driven by the goals.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:39.980]   And if you have a goal of being a mega billionaire, that's going to require a very different allocation
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:45.940]   of your time and a very different allocation of your money than if your goal is I just
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:51.380]   want to live a debt-free life, save a little bit of money and spend a lot of time outside.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.380]   Very different plan.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.860]   Is one right or is one wrong?
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.860]   You be the judge.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:02.420]   I'm just pointing out there's a very different plan.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:10.700]   Next major idea is in all of these circumstances, you've got to start with the big rocks first.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.260]   Here I'm referring back to the classic illustration of time management.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.780]   Stephen Covey is the one who popularized it.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:23.940]   Professor stands at the front of the room, fills up a jar with big rocks, presents it
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.100]   to the class and says, "Is the jar full?"
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.940]   They all agree that yes, it is.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:35.020]   Professor puts the jar down, puts some gravel, which filters around the big rocks, looks
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.380]   up to the class and says, "Is the jar full?"
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.060]   Class says, "Yeah, we think it is," but they're starting to wise up.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:46.680]   Professor pours sand down in among the rocks and holds it up and says, "Is the jar full?"
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.140]   One student bravely says, "I think so," but they're not very sure of it.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.220]   Professor takes a pitcher of water, pours the pitcher of water in, fills the jar up.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.220]   Now is the jar full?
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.100]   Yes, finally the jar is full.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.140]   The point of the illustration is that if you start with filling the jar with water and
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.020]   then you put sand and then you put gravel, you're never going to get everything into
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.100]   the jar because you put all the little things in first and you can't ever get the big things
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.420]   in on top.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.140]   The point is life only works if you start with the big rocks, if you start with the
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.260]   important things and do those first and then fit everything else in around those.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.340]   That theme is consistent with regard to money, time, and food.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.900]   We've got to start with the big rocks.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:32.580]   Start with the things that are going to make the biggest impact on your situation, the
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.980]   big habits, the big expenditures.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:40.820]   Sometimes the major roadblock in a budget is the fact that there's a car payment.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.060]   If we just get rid of the car payment, it loosens everything else up.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.700]   It makes no sense to focus on the little things.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.140]   You're spending, you're buying a $4 latte or you have a bad habit of giving a dollar
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.140]   to the kid on the street.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:25:00.820]   It makes no sense to start with those things when there's a big giant problem.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.540]   Start with the big rocks first.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.540]   That concept could be expanded.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.540]   It's just a mental concept.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.900]   It could be expanded to say why are we focusing on the budget when you're making $11,000
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.900]   a year.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.700]   No matter your level of budgeting prowess, it's very difficult to live on $11,000 a year.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:22.140]   Let's start with the big thing, which leads me to my next major idea, which in some ways
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.300]   is complementary to the idea of big rocks first, but it's also a little bit different
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.920]   that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can work.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.160]   This is where you can help somebody by starting with the big stuff or you can help them by
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.520]   starting with the little stuff because we're not necessarily talking about the specific
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   detail.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:47.480]   We're talking about a person and that person is going to need life change.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.280]   Best example on this topic is years ago, I read David Allen's book called Getting Things
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:26:00.360]   Done and his emphasis in that book was on the very tangible tactical level of task completion.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.080]   What's the next action that I can take that will result in the project being moved forward?
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.720]   He didn't spend much time talking in that book about the big giant goals that we can
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.240]   talk about and how your vision for your life can be planned out.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.960]   This is why it's so utterly overwhelming when somebody who's just trying to figure out,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.840]   "Well, how do I have enough money to buy food this month?"
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.640]   Talk about, "Let's plan out a major plan for your life."
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.880]   It doesn't work.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.800]   But if you help somebody with little things, it can do it.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.200]   On the flip side, it might work.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.520]   That's where sometimes you can do the top down.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.320]   The bottom up is the little things first, focusing on the little things, the little
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.200]   habits, eating the – for food, it would be eating the candy on the co-worker's desk.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.640]   For time, it would be how many times to check Facebook.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.840]   But you can start with the big ones and say, "Let's just make one big major change.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.480]   Let's start with your most important project and spend two hours working on that every
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   morning.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.320]   Let's start with fixing breakfast and have a really great breakfast."
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.520]   Top down and bottom up are both important.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   It's ultimately going to be OK to focus on either of them.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.440]   We've got to handle the big stuff.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.680]   We've got to handle the big car payment.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.280]   But we might need to get there with a bottom up approach or with a quick top down approach
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.480]   and that's going to be very subject to the person's personality.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.240]   Next, we need tools that are appropriate for the job that are based on the goal.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.460]   Not everybody needs some fancy dancy budgeting software.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.960]   Not everybody needs YNAB, the sponsor of the show.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.680]   Not everybody needs YNAB.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.280]   When I was in college, I kept my budget on a legal pad and there were six categories.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.720]   Every month, I write down the amount of money that I'd had, write to get my rent, take
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.600]   out my savings, take out my giving, take out my rent, take out my car insurance, and then
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.000]   I would take cash out of the bank for food and that included any groceries or dining
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.440]   out and then I'd take cash out of the bank for little expenditures if I wanted to buy
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.440]   something small.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.680]   That was basically it.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.320]   It wasn't much more – I guess a cell phone bill.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.720]   I missed a cell phone bill.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.440]   But it took about five minutes and it was a once a month deal and the constraint, the
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.720]   level of appropriate control, the appropriate tool in that situation was cash and it worked
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.480]   great.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.360]   But of course now, when I'm running a household with many more budget categories and multiple
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.920]   people, it's different and I expect it to be much different in the future as my financial
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.360]   life becomes more complicated.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   I could not run my budget today based on cash.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.180]   It doesn't work in our modern world.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.940]   So they're just tools and you've got to find a tool that's appropriate for the job
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.640]   based upon the specific goal.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:50.520]   Next major idea is we need appropriate levels of control and here I'm specifically talking
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.160]   about the curbing effects of a budget.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.520]   So this is – when I'm using the term budget, it should be evident to you by now that I'm
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.760]   thinking about budgeting perhaps in a way of thinking about allocation, choosing the
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.800]   allocation of resources.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.000]   But when many people are thinking about budgets, they're thinking about the curbing effect
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.240]   of a budget.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.360]   The idea that I only have $100 to spend on clothing.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.400]   How am I going to – I want to spend $120.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.880]   Oh, I can't do it because the budget says I can't.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.320]   That can be very, very valuable but that needs to be appropriate based upon the phase of
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.840]   life, phase of business and the goals involved.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.360]   Think about this in terms of a business startup, a business venture.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.560]   I am running a business startup.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:41.160]   In the beginning of the business startup, I put a very tight level of control on every
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.480]   single dollar.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.040]   When you're facing a high degree of uncertainty, you've got to keep resources back.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.760]   Example, you're walking on a hike.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.800]   You see the end of the hike up above.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   You're feeling thirsty.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.880]   You're just down the whole bottle of water.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.960]   No big deal.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.240]   You can get water up ahead.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.280]   You don't need to exercise a tight level of rationing and control in the bottle of
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   water.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.960]   There's a high degree of certainty.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.360]   You're out in the middle of the desert and all of a sudden you realize you're totally
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.360]   lost.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.240]   You have no idea where you are and you have a half a bottle of water left.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.320]   Do you just start chugging water?
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.360]   You're probably going to start to think about caring for things and rationing a little
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.520]   bit more.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.000]   So the amount of certainty that you have about the situation is what dictates your ability
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   to consume.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.440]   So in the initial stages of starting a business, cash controls have to be very, very, very
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.720]   tight.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.480]   Business starts to grow.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.360]   Is it appropriate that a highly functioning business that where everything is doing well,
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.200]   there's substantial profit margins, that every single dollar has to be tracked?
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   I don't think so.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.840]   I'm not going to say tracked, but I mean controlled.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.020]   I don't think so because you reach a point in time where it's more frustrating than
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.800]   it is empowering.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:59.120]   If you are running a large business, the $1.99 purchase doesn't really make nearly a big
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.560]   difference when you're dealing with $100,000 purchases.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.080]   So in business, this should be evident.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.880]   Well, let's take it over to personal lives.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.360]   Let's say that you are this type of person or you're working with somebody.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.960]   Somebody is deeply in debt.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.600]   They are behind on their bills and they're really struggling and there's uncertainty
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.840]   at work.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.840]   Guess what?
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.760]   You need an absolute tight system of control.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.880]   Remember, I'm not talking about necessarily how much money he spends.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.840]   I'm talking about system of control.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.120]   So in that situation, when I'm counseling somebody, we take every single automatic payment
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.240]   out of the bank account.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.000]   We stop every single automatic transaction.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.800]   We take the whole – it's like a full stop on everything and we take back radical control
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:51.040]   of the budget, every single dollar, every one.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.000]   We move to a system of controls that is absolutely foolproof, something like cash because you
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.680]   can't afford if someone is deeply in debt, you can't afford to have a $35 bounce check
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   fee.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.720]   That's destructive when somebody is in that situation.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.900]   So cash is tight.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:12.320]   Put everything on cash, envelope system, budgeting all the way, very, very tight, daily analysis,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.960]   daily tracking, what's the balance today, just everything tight.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.720]   Now fast forward a little bit.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.380]   Out of debt, good margin between savings and income.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.560]   Do you really expect somebody to live on that type of tight control forever?
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   I don't.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.440]   I think it's absurd to think about somebody needs to have that level of control and they
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.880]   have to look in their wallet before going to Costco and recognize I've got $82 in here
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.760]   so I can only spend $82.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   That's silly.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   Somebody is doing well.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   You go to Costco.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   You see one of their fancy doodads they bring in.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.880]   Oh, hey, here's a $200 item I'd really like to have and I never knew I wanted to
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.240]   have it until I went to Costco.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.120]   But no, go ahead.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.660]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.580]   And does somebody who's a multimillionaire need a system of controls where every single
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.220]   day they're checking things?
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.220]   No.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:06.300]   They just need some basic big picture intention and have a check on it maybe once a month,
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.500]   maybe once a quarter, maybe even once a year would be totally fine.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.460]   So there needs to be an appropriate level of control based upon the situation that someone
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.980]   is in.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:28.100]   So the process of budgeting is the same in every type of budgeting, time, money and food
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.700]   and it goes through these different phases.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.540]   We always start with awareness.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.380]   We build a simple tracking system that's appropriate.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.140]   We want to move on to intentional planning and here the key is the bigger the results
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.300]   that you want, the more intentional you'll need to be.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   I've shared on the show how a breakthrough banner year for me was when I was in college
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.700]   and my senior year of college.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.740]   That was the year that me personally, I was determined to get out of debt.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.500]   I was doing the Dave Ramsey plan, work like crazy, get out of debt.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.420]   I worked a 40-hour full-time job.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.280]   I took 19 hours of classes and I did well in school.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:08.660]   But in order to get there, I had to establish a very, very, very tight budget of my time.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.060]   Every single hour was planned out.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.620]   I'd mapped out all my classes.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:17.060]   The classes were all very efficiently laid out so that I could work on a certain schedule.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.660]   Every single thing was accounted for at the time when I'm going to do homework.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:25.540]   The only free time I had was I'd scheduled in a couple of hours of fun on Friday night,
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.220]   Saturday night, something like that.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.420]   It said free time.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.820]   That was it.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:35.700]   But I got great results and the level of control was very, very tight because I was shooting
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.300]   for very high results.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.460]   In food, the people who are going to get the best results, their level of control is going
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.620]   to be very tight.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:49.740]   In money, if that person with $2 million in the bank is determined that they're going
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:56.260]   to become the next billionaire, they've still got to have a very tight level of control.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.980]   If they're content with a few million bucks, then they don't need such a tight level of
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.620]   control.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.460]   The bigger the results you want, the more intentional you need to be.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:11.340]   So the cool thing about this process of budgeting, we start with awareness, move on to intentional,
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:20.260]   proactive planning of allocation, tight controls, and then we transition to habits.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:25.460]   Somebody who's developed good habits doesn't need such a tight system.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:31.860]   We just need to transition to good habits with some kind of appropriate ongoing checking.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:36.040]   People who maintain their weight, they weigh themselves every day and if they fluctuate
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.260]   by more than a certain amount, or they weigh themselves once a month, or they go in for
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.380]   their annual checkup, we need some sort of system of checking up.
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.620]   With money, we need to check our account statements and see, "Okay, the last quarter, how did
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.620]   we do?
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.660]   How's our net worth increased?"
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:56.780]   Those controls and ongoing checking will give you the data that you need to be able to say,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.660]   "Are we happy and satisfied or do we need to make a change?"
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:04.260]   The better the results, we'll have to tighten up, so we make the budget a little bit tighter
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.980]   because the biggest results always come from that careful, diligent planning.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:13.700]   But if we're okay with the results we have, then enjoy the looseness a little bit.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.740]   Next let's talk about tools.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:20.140]   I think the tools that we use vary based upon where we are.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:25.580]   So here I'm going to talk about money primarily and give you money tools, but I will weave
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:32.040]   in food and time because I believe that these concepts are applicable in each category.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.740]   First we need a dashboard.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.220]   Some kind of overview system.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.180]   Some way to have a quick check of where we are.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.940]   That's what a dashboard on a car does or a dashboard on a boat or whatever.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.860]   It just tells you, "Hey, here are the RPMs, here's the speed.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.860]   Any problems?"
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.620]   We need some kind of dashboard system.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.980]   It needs to have good data and it's good if it has some reports.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.620]   So those reports are useful if it's money and we can look and say, "Okay, the last three
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.540]   months we've spent about this much.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.100]   Our spending is averaging up.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.260]   Our spending is averaging down."
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.740]   That's useful.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.180]   Or if it's time, "Okay, we're spending about this number of hours on productive things
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.180]   versus unproductive things."
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.480]   If it's food, "All right, our weight is adjusting in this certain way."
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.300]   So we need some tools for the dashboard overview.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.000]   But we also need tools for big picture planning and intention.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.980]   So we need some kind of forward-looking tool that, extending the metaphor of the car, the
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.380]   dashboard doesn't tell you where you're going.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.580]   It just tells you basically how things are going.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.580]   So we need to look forward and say, "Are we headed to the East Coast or West?"
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.580]   Same thing with money.
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.700]   "Are we headed for this goal or that?"
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:44.860]   So we need some kind of forward intention in a proactive forward-looking tool.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:49.900]   Then we also need some intentional boundaries, that system of controls that's going to keep
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.860]   us on track.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:59.820]   So the best results come when we have tools that address all of these.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.940]   And they might be the same tool or they might not be.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.940]   And again, it's got to be appropriate to the level of complexity in your life.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.980]   Tools should serve you.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.600]   You shouldn't serve them.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.260]   So some simple financial tools to actually implement these concepts.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.620]   Simple dashboards that are available.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.380]   Mint.com is the most popular one.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.380]   They do a great job.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.380]   It's a free system.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.900]   You put all your data in there.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.900]   They mine your data.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.420]   They present to you some simple reports.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.420]   You can pull it up.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.140]   You can see how all your accounts are at any time.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.420]   You can just pull it up and see.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.700]   You can run some quick reports.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.700]   It works great.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.300]   It's a dashboard.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.260]   My favorite is Personal Capital as far as they're much prettier and they have more useful
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.260]   investment functions.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.660]   I'm actually launching them as a sponsor on the show very soon.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.780]   Links are already on the website.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.500]   If you've never used Personal Capital, go to YNAB.com/PersonalCapital.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.940]   It's like Mint but better and they have much prettier dashboards and it just does a good
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.940]   job.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   Personal Capital is awesome.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:56.940]   Same thing.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.940]   You load all your accounts in there.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.180]   It loads your investment accounts.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.180]   It gives tracking.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.700]   You load all the information in there.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.500]   What both of those companies do, Mint and Personal Capital, is they're taking a look
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.700]   at your data and then they're trying to offer you something better, a way to save money,
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:14.420]   trying to offer you a way to enhance your situation in some way.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.380]   We had on the show Peter Polson from Tiller.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.380]   Tiller is great.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.380]   It's cool.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.380]   It's a tracking system.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.300]   It's a great way to track your data and you can use it to have great spreadsheets.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.500]   That can fill the job.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:30.380]   Your dashboard could be something as simple as checking your account statements, your
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.140]   checkbook register.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.460]   Is money going up or is money going down?
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.300]   These are just simply concepts of – these are tools for looking at a dashboard.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.420]   YNAB is a great dashboard.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   You can pull it up.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.960]   You can see all your account balances, see how things are going.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.300]   They have some good simple reports for tracking.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.480]   Just hey, here's where the money is spent.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.200]   These different things perform that dashboard function very well.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.500]   With regard to tracking of expenses, I jumped the gun there and talked about YNAB with tracking.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.460]   YNAB will work for dashboards because it can show you some account information.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.580]   But the downside with YNAB is it's got to be account information that you enter currently.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:14.120]   It's not the type of dashboard that will illustrate for you your investment balances.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.740]   It doesn't auto-import that kind of stuff.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.900]   Tracking software, your bank has some kind of tracking software.
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.100]   So you're figuring out where is the money going.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.380]   Most banks now, if you categorize the stuff, you can pull up those reports.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.260]   So you can figure out where is the money going.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:32.080]   Quicken, Microsoft Money, all of those systems do a great job of – if you're importing
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.740]   the data, tracking where it's going.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:34.740]   Mint does it.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.180]   Personal Capital does it.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.640]   Here is where YNAB does it.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.800]   If you're entering the data and it's tracking, it's tracking the data going back.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.780]   So you can have different tools for a dashboard system, different tools for a tracking system.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.880]   I don't track any categories for me.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.780]   I don't track any categories in Personal Capital.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.380]   All I use it is as an easy way for me to aggregate all of my accounts.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.060]   I'm testing Tiller.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:02.940]   Tiller does tracking and does kind of big picture view dashboard stuff.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:08.540]   Then you move to the concept of proactive planning and that's where your options become
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.580]   far fewer.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:17.940]   You can do proactive planning with a yellow pad if your situation is simple enough.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.540]   If you're working with a yellow pad, probably you will need to just do a cash envelope system.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:27.180]   If your situation is simple or let's say you're teaching your kids or you are a young
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:33.300]   person with a simple life or maybe an old person with a simple life, some of us who
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:38.180]   are at more complicated stages probably a little envious of you, cash in an envelope
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.940]   and then you're putting some constraints on there because when the cash is gone, I
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.940]   can't spend it.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.100]   But you're proactively allocating, "Hey, here's $2,000 and $100 bills.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.300]   It's being divided up in this way," and then there's a constraint on there.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:51.980]   There's a control.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:58.980]   A great piece of software that I've used in the past is a software called Envelopes.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.820]   As in Mike, Envelopes.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.020]   They do a good job as far as that's their whole concept is taking the cash envelope
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.620]   system and putting it to a proactive forward-looking system.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:14.060]   I didn't like the price tag on Envelopes which is why I never continued through buying
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.940]   their service, but they do a good job.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.340]   That was why when I switched to YNAB, it was a better value.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.860]   Once I tried YNAB again, those of you who have listened to the show and that's when
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.580]   I brought them on the show as a sponsor, when I tried YNAB, I realized, "Wait a second.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.100]   This does everything Envelopes does and it's a much better price point, much better deal."
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:36.100]   If you'd like to try YNAB, radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab is the link for them, the sponsor link for
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.420]   them.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.820]   But those tools are not necessary for everybody.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.380]   You don't need to necessarily track week to week, month to month.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.380]   I do.
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.660]   I'm at the stage where I need to.
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:53.020]   I don't anticipate doing that forever, although I might because maybe it becomes such a good
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:57.980]   habit and I see the value of it, but if I had 10 million bucks in the bank, I don't
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   think I'd do that.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.100]   If I had 10 million bucks in the bank, I'd create some kind of just annualized pro forma
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.820]   big picture idea based upon my income sources.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:12.140]   I'd have a bookkeeper track that stuff and have the bookkeeper be the one providing controls
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.060]   and just give them some guidelines to say, "I'm going to look at this stuff quarterly
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:22.020]   and then let me know if I'm making a wide variation in my spending."
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.540]   It's going to change based upon where you are.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:28.020]   That's what – speaking specifically on the money question, this is what's so frustrating
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:36.260]   to people is the system that you need at 18 is not the system that you need at 68.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:47.060]   So people often have experience with their system and they don't know how to think
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.540]   about somebody at a different place.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.460]   Let me give you an example just to illustrate this with an email exchange.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.980]   A listener of the show named Brian emailed me.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.260]   He says, "Joshua, I wanted to get your opinion on something as it relates to one of your
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.260]   sponsor's products.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.540]   I'm trying to figure out if I'll get anything out of using YNAB.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.420]   I'll give some background on my current financial status and goals.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:10.540]   I've been using Mint to track my finances since 2009, so I have a historical data going
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.540]   back to then.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:15.300]   I have a budget set up on there that I use to track all of my monthly spending.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.380]   I meticulously itemize and categorize every transaction that Mint pulls in and I check
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.380]   it every day.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.380]   I think it's fun.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.540]   I pay off my credit card balance every month and the only loan that I have is the remainder
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:29.140]   of my student loan, currently $1,300 at a 1.62% interest rate.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.340]   So I'm not paying it off in full until it's just making the payments.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:38.940]   I max out my 401(k), my HSA, my Roth IRA, and I put any excess money into taxable investments
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.300]   after making sure my three and six-month safety nets are fully funded.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.680]   I live a simple life focusing on minimizing my expenses and environmental footprint.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.780]   My current savings rate is between 60 and 65% and I'm aiming for financial independence
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.780]   at 45.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.220]   Currently, I'm 34.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:57.040]   Once I get there, I'm going to be volunteering my time and I'll probably still be earning
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.620]   some money with some more fulfilling part-time work.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.540]   This is where I start to question my current methods.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.140]   I know already exactly where every single cent of my money is going but I'm wondering
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.620]   if switching to YNAB to track everything would be beneficial for an active budgeting once
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.900]   I'm not relying on an external paycheck.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.340]   Were all my money current spending and savings habits strong enough that I wouldn't need
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.340]   it?
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.940]   Most of the YNAB users I read about, they're focused on getting out of debt and getting
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.180]   their finances in order.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.900]   They usually start using it at a place of complete financial ignorance but I know I'm
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.980]   already in a good place and there's room for improvement.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.940]   So he says, "So starting where I am right now, do you think it would be a good investment
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.180]   of time and money to switch my finance tracking to YNAB in preparation for the future?"
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.300]   I don't know if a 30-day trial period will answer him.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   Here was my response.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.420]   I said, "Brian, it's probably not going to make a big, huge difference for you how much
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.300]   money you're able to save.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.840]   You're already disciplined and you already have a system," I would insert here, "a system
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.020]   of controls that works well for you.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.340]   You have a steady income and as long as you're earning a steady paycheck, you don't need
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:58.260]   the extra budgeting figures because you just don't need it.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.860]   I think it would be helpful when you leave your job and start living.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.220]   Just try it for 30 days and see it.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.220]   Do you need it?
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.220]   No.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.220]   You're doing fine without it.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   Is it better than mint?
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.220]   Yes."
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.540]   The point was this person already had a good system of tracking and there was plenty of
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.340]   margin in what they were doing.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:17.060]   They didn't need to track every single dollar.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.900]   If somebody is saving 60% to 65% of their income on an ongoing basis and they're already
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:25.300]   tracking carefully their money and they decide they want to spend something, they want to
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:29.800]   buy some $200 item, do they have to all of a sudden rework their whole budget to figure
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.380]   out the $200?
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.380]   No.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:38.360]   That's very different than if you're month to month, day to day and you got to figure
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.940]   out where do I get the $200 from to buy this item.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.360]   Very, very different.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.360]   The appropriate level of control has to be there at different stages.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.200]   I want to briefly cover how these different types of tools are available for tracking
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.960]   time and for tracking food as well and then wrap up with some budgeting questions from
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.800]   the Patreon page.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.600]   But first, quick dashboard.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.440]   So let's talk about time.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.620]   Dashboard overview is where is my time going?
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.620]   That might be your calendar.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:11.720]   I like to have a list of here's the number of hours that I'm spending.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.000]   So here, dashboards and tracking.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.640]   I've used a few tools in the past that I've mentioned on the show.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.120]   Presently, I am using something called Toggle.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.840]   It's T-O-G-G-L.com, Toggle.com.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.600]   What Toggle does, it's a free time tracking.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.400]   They have a smartphone app.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.080]   They have a web app and they have an actual program for your computer.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.840]   The great thing about Toggle is it allows me just to put in what I'm working on and
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   how much time and I have some different projects put in.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.560]   So what I track is what am I doing and then I track it.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.640]   Is this income producing or is this not income producing?
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.140]   Because as an entrepreneur, it can be very, very challenging to stay focused on the things
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:57.480]   that make you money instead of on the things that cost you money because the things that
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.760]   cost you money always seem to be yelling louder than the things that make you money.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.080]   So I use that as a simple time tracking thing.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:09.220]   That's been helpful for me as I've just tried to get a handle on now that my life is settling
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:14.080]   down a little bit and I'm able to rebuild the structure.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.800]   It's helpful and I would encourage you every single year, at least take a month or take
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:23.080]   a week, two weeks or something and just kind of get a grasp on where is the time going.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.200]   Track your time and get a quick overview.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.680]   When it comes to proactive planning, you have to choose, OK, how am I going to proactively
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.800]   plan my time?
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.920]   So here in the next year, my wife and I, we've sat down.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.540]   We've completely reworked our household schedule.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.720]   We've got my schedule changed.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.800]   We've got her and the kids are on a schedule.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.840]   So we know exactly at a certain time at 1 o'clock every day and it helps so much with
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.400]   a toddler and a baby.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.480]   The baby is a little bit schedulized.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.240]   We're not hardcore on having her totally scheduled.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.720]   But also it's not totally free.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.820]   But with my toddler, then we have a plan for him.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.840]   So we know at 11 o'clock, here's what the plan is because otherwise what happens is
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.480]   you go from one thing to the next and you wander instead of, OK, at 11 o'clock, we're
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   going to do art.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.120]   At 12 o'clock, it's nap time.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.320]   At 2 o'clock, it's going to be time to go for a walk.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.160]   Then it's going to be free time at the park.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.080]   Here are the days we're going to go to the park and here are the days we're going to
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.480]   do laundry.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.960]   The concept is the same whether you're running a multimillion-dollar business or running
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.240]   a household.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:30.200]   So we have – we've built out schedules and those schedules are up on the refrigerator
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.800]   and on my desk of here are the hours that I'm working.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   Same thing when you come in with proactive planning, you have to have an approach for
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   your workday.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.960]   What are the most important things that I'm going to get done first?
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.080]   If you're not doing that, everything falls apart.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.920]   I'll be doing I think the next show after this which will be the final show of the year.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.360]   I'm intending to do a kind of a state of the show, just a little bit of a personal
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   story.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360]   Here's where the show has been.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.160]   Here's where it's going in the next year, some of the changes I'm anticipating for
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.360]   2016.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.360]   But one aspect of that is when you're not on a schedule, you can't get much done.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   The challenge in my house, the big challenge has been because of the needs of my little
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.200]   baby girl, that completely upset the apple cart with regard to the show.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:16.960]   My average monthly show production dropped from 18-ish, 18 to 20 shows a month to – there
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.120]   were two months I think that had 12, eight?
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.240]   No, two months that had eight, 12, just dramatically dropped.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.280]   Well, why?
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.780]   Because everything else upset the schedule.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.400]   So no problem.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.520]   You got to deal with the emergencies when they happen.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.120]   But that's – it all comes back to budgeting.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.600]   You got to have tools with regard to food as well.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.360]   So you can have simple overview tools.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.360]   Hey, I've got a scale.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.800]   OK, that's a dashboard.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.520]   Here's my weight or body fat percentage or whatever.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.740]   How you look in the mirror, I don't know.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.760]   This is where I struggle the most.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.320]   So I'm slow to give advice on this.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.140]   But if you look at things like tracking, something is simple.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.440]   Have a system of tracking.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.480]   For me, taking pictures of the food as I eat it.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.600]   So at least if I could take a picture of it, I can be aware of it and I can go back through
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.040]   and look for patterns and trends.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.040]   Am I really overeating or am I not?
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.680]   Am I really eating too many carbohydrates or am I not?
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.760]   Just simple habit of taking a picture.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:14.480]   Then the proactive planning is how do I make sure that the choices are there?
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   Where are the problems?
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.640]   How do I budget my time so that I can cook the good food?
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:23.880]   How do I make sure the good food is available when I'm in a bind instead of the wrong choices?
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.640]   You'll have to figure out what works for you.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.520]   So I want to answer some questions here from the Patreon page and then we'll be done for
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.520]   today.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.800]   I put this out, the show topic out on Patreon in advance and a few people asked questions.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.080]   So I want to answer some of those questions.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:43.960]   Scott asked me the question, he said, "What are the pros and cons of micromanaging discretionary
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:48.720]   expenses versus having a monthly lump sum not to exceed limit?
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.680]   Example, food, clothing, home, pet, baby versus Costco."
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.040]   Scott, I think it very much depends on the phase that you're in.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.440]   If you're trying to make a change.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.640]   So with budgeting, if you're just trying to make sure you don't overspend your income,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.160]   it doesn't matter much whether Costco is broken out into each of those different things or
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.160]   if it's just Costco.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.600]   You're just trying not to overspend.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:16.200]   But if you're trying to make changes at that, you need to know what those transactions are.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.600]   So if you're looking down and you're saying, "Man, we're spending $800 a month, $800 a
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.840]   month on food," and you hear someone else say, "Well, we spend $400 a month," you say,
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.640]   "Well, that sounds a little extreme."
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:32.740]   But if Costco is at $800 a month, you're probably not just buying food.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.160]   You're buying food and you're buying a generator and you're buying clothing, like you said
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.600]   here, and you're buying dog food.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.960]   Well, you're spending $800 a month on all that stuff, not just on food.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.780]   And so if you're trying to make a change or if you're concerned, you got to drill down
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.640]   just to see what's actually going on.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:54.480]   Not on a month – do you need to every single month sit down and carefully itemize your
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.040]   Costco receipt only if you're tracking it for a purpose?
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.680]   Otherwise, it's probably not the best use of time or at least it's not the best use
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.680]   of time as long as you have plenty of other money and you're just kind of doing it for
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.000]   interest.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.920]   If you've got money, the money is flowing, there's excess, you're saving towards the
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:15.840]   big goals, I don't think you need that crazy level of detail unless you're really going
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.600]   for dramatic results.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.280]   Food is a good example.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.480]   Does every single person out there, every business executive, does every business executive
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.520]   need to track every single one of their micro and macro nutrients?
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.440]   No, only if you're trying to pursue elite athletic ability.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.560]   But if you're trying to dig in and say, "Why am I gaining weight?"
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.440]   It might be good to track them for a month and find out what's going on.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   You can draw a lot and extrapolate a lot from a month.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.640]   So that would be my answer.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.140]   Joe asked, "What's a good budgeting strategy for a two-income household where one income
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:51.640]   is steady and predictable and the other is unpredictable in timing and amount?
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   Cheers."
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:58.680]   Joe, I would say budget for the bills, the ongoing expenses off of the steady income
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:07.080]   and then budget the unpredictably timed, unpredictably amounted money for the more discretionary
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   expenses.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   And so this would be...
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:13.860]   YNAB is getting lots of plugs today, but this would be why I love YNAB.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:17.800]   Because with YNAB, what you're doing is you're budgeting the actual money that you have in
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.920]   the account.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:24.040]   And so in that situation, I struggled with this for years because I've been on unpredictable
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.460]   income forever.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.600]   And YNAB has made such a big difference even just to...
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.120]   My system was just more of a tracking system because I couldn't figure out the easy proactive
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.120]   system.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.120]   So I would do it on the fly.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.800]   I struggled for years.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.620]   It's so much better now.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:42.160]   So I would try to...
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.160]   If the steady income lines up, and I've just got to figure out how much is it versus what
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.160]   the goals are.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:52.480]   If the steady income lines up with the bills and hopefully the savings as well, then use
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.560]   the other one for discretionary stuff.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.560]   And you just, with YNAB, you budget the money that's in the account.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.800]   So when the money comes in, you sit down and say, "What should we spend it on?"
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.220]   And you prioritize.
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:07.480]   We want to fund the vacation fund or we want to go get our teeth fixed.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.840]   Okay, which one is more important?
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.240]   And just budget on that.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:14.480]   But the nice thing is most of us live in a monthly society.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.040]   We pay monthly bills and that steady predictable floor can make a big difference.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.440]   That's the best I got for you.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.080]   Sam says, "Do you have any particular advice about how to budget for gift giving without
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.180]   becoming overly stingy about it?"
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:33.000]   My advice is to have a percentage of your income that you are going to give away.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.440]   Set that aside in a separate account and always have it available so that it's there for the
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.520]   gifts.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.520]   That's what I do.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.120]   Take a percentage of your income, set it aside and use it for gifts.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.280]   Now, you can decide what the meaning of that category is.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:51.160]   So is that gift, do those gifts include birthday gifts and Christmas gifts and graduation gifts
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.280]   or do those gifts include people on the street?
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.560]   You've got to decide for that.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.240]   But just figure out how much of my money, in my percentage of my income do I want to
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.520]   give away and then just try to give it away.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:05.120]   That's one of the best things you can do.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:11.800]   I have strong feelings about budgeting to be able to give and save before you do anything
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.800]   else.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:18.600]   Once you have a giving account, it totally changes the way that you view life.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:21.080]   It helps you to feel less stingy.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.520]   It helps you feel richer.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:30.920]   What's remarkable is if you start building up some funds in your giving account, let's
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:37.800]   say that you allocate 10% of your income, household income $50,000, you're going to
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.480]   give away 10% of your income.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.820]   That's $5,000.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:45.160]   That is amazing when you start to even just on that, a median income, think about giving
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:50.800]   away $5,000 every single year and you allocate the money in advance and then you have an
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.880]   account that always has money in it.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.840]   So when you come across a need and you say, "Hey, here's a need that I can help," you
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:00.960]   start packing it up and you can make some really nice gifts just by simply allocating
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.300]   that money steadily over time.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:08.160]   That makes a huge difference in your outlook on life and it is so empowering and it's the
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.400]   most fun.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.400]   It's so empowering.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.680]   So that would be how I would handle it is decide what percentage of your money you're
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.720]   going to give away and get rid of it and give it away.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.440]   Look for the opportunities but give it away.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.940]   Someday I should do shows on giving but for today, I'll just say it's more blessed to
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:26.080]   give than to receive.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.560]   So Chris asks, "What's the best method of budgeting calories and food?
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.120]   I've spent over two years tuning in my usage of YNAB, which is the best product out there
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.420]   for money budgeting, but have not yet found a good way to track my eating.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.840]   Many of my approaches were just not convenient as I would have liked and ended up only getting
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.240]   a few weeks of actual usage."
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.480]   Maybe you can give some ideas.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.280]   So Chris, on this one, I don't have a perfect system.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.400]   This is my biggest weakness personally.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   I'm good at time.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.440]   I'm good at money.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.320]   I'm not so good at food.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:00.000]   So part of me doing the show today is to encourage myself and to push out the ideas that can
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.360]   be useful.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.280]   I've tried some of the different apps as far as where you enter in every meal and everything.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.080]   I found them so constrictive because I don't eat from a package.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:15.560]   Interestingly, I saw on J.D. Roth's Facebook page that he was actually telling his girlfriend
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:19.440]   – he was going to design – his girlfriend wanted to lose weight evidently and his diet
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:25.920]   for her was that he was going to put her on a packaged food diet.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.560]   The point was that by being on a packaged food diet, you could use a tracking app like
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.560]   MyFitnessPal or whatever, something like that.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.960]   You could use a tracking app, scan the barcode and have all the nutritional data automatically
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   installed.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:46.760]   His point was calories are more important than anything else and so by tracking that
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.200]   with a barcode, we'll be able to make more options.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.240]   I thought, "Interesting idea," because I can see the value.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.160]   Now we don't eat – in my family, we don't eat a lot of packaged foods and so it's
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.120]   really frustrating when I'm sitting there making something with food and, "Okay,
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.480]   am I going to weigh this and I'm making a big bowl for the family?
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.600]   Am I going to sit there and put these things on a scale to be able to track this?"
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.260]   I haven't been able to come up with that.
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:12.320]   So what I'm convinced has the biggest difference is personally for me, overweight guy talking,
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.280]   take this with a grain of salt, do your own research.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:20.840]   I'm convinced calories are not a major factor in weight.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.160]   I'm convinced they're also not a major factor in health.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.440]   Now there are lots of people who disagree with me but I've read as extensively as
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.000]   I can and I can't find the data that demonstrates that calories are the key.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.800]   So what I've been working on is adjusting the major choices.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:41.960]   So many people seem well agreed on the fact that calories are not the contributor of weight
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.400]   gain, it's carbohydrates.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:51.600]   And so each of us will have a varying level at which our bodies come out based upon the
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.960]   amount of carbohydrates.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.760]   So that to me is easier to track.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:59.660]   It's not necessarily to track in an app, it's easier to track with the choices.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:04.440]   So that's what I choose to do and so for me, I try to just take pictures and say, "Remind
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.520]   myself, what am I eating?"
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.720]   And so that way I know if I chose to eat something that had more carbohydrates, "Oh, I've got
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.360]   the record there."
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.160]   So it's not a surprise.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.040]   But you're going to have to go to someone else because I'm not an expert, anything beyond
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   that.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:23.840]   I would say if the most compelling book that I read on the subject was Why We Get Fat by
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   Gary Taubes.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.800]   Another compelling book was Wheat Belly.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.400]   I read those books a few months ago and they both were really, really compelling.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.800]   And I knew the basic premise of them but finally I read the books and they helped me to be
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.560]   confident and more confident in my perspective.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.840]   But there's too much of a battle out there.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   I don't want to get into that one anymore.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.480]   Lee asks, "I'd love to get to Jesse Mecham's live on last month's income but other than
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.760]   cut back on spending, do you have any practical tips?
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.760]   P.S. close to 20% of net income is put straight to savings so it's not like we're spending
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760]   everything."
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.880]   Lee, I would say you're using YNAB and so one of the major premises of YNAB is live
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.360]   on last month's income.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.400]   I didn't get that until I walked through their training and all of a sudden I realized what
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.920]   that little function of budgeting the income for December or January was.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.140]   And so it's very simple.
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:13.320]   If you are saving that much money, you're saving 20% of your income.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.240]   As long as you've done that for five months, you have one month's income in savings.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.720]   What I would do is just simply move the money into my checking account and then I would
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.160]   allocate – I would start putting this month's money and allocating it for next month and
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.320]   then I would go ahead and just replenish the savings and just adjust it very simply.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.040]   If you're saving that percentage of your income, you're in good shape.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.080]   If you don't have that much money in savings, then follow the plan that they have in their
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.720]   budget where you set up a buffer account.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:48.120]   What you do is in your YNAB budgeting system, you establish a buffer account and you fund
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.920]   that buffer account until it's equal to one month's expenses.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:58.160]   So the money will gradually grow in your checking account and then once it's grown to be an
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:04.000]   amount equal to one month's expenses, then you just pull it out of the buffer account,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.200]   budget it and from then on, you put all the money into the month ahead.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.400]   So that's the way that they do it and it really works great.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.600]   Last question comes from Victoria.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.280]   She says, "How do you fit budgeting for big expenses like a kitchen remodel into your
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   budget?
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.360]   I tend to stop my long-term savings for X number of months to save for big purchases
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.640]   but wonder if there's a better way."
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.440]   So Victoria, I don't know if there's a better way.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.440]   No.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:31.900]   I would just say for me, the key question here would be getting clear on your priorities.
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:37.040]   So I don't have a lot of experience as being a homeowner for decades to where, "OK, I'm
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040]   going to remodel the kitchen."
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.620]   I will tell you where I'm at now at my age is I wouldn't remodel the kitchen because
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:47.160]   right now, it would cost me too much money as compared to my long-term goals of financial
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.540]   independence.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:55.120]   But if I started to realize that remodeling the kitchen was a priority, then I would assess
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.300]   it and I would say, "Would I rather have the kitchen remodeled?"
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   Maybe that would bring my wife a greater deal of happiness and that would be worth it.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.980]   Maybe it would bring me – if I would, I'd rather have the kitchen remodeled and delay
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:13.680]   financial independence by X number of months or years or not.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.560]   I would run that calculation so that I knew.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.720]   Then if I knew that I'd rather have the kitchen remodeled, I would do exactly what
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   you said.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   I would just say, "OK.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.360]   Right now, we're going to remodel the kitchen and this is going to be the major priority."
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.480]   I don't know of anything more intelligent to do than that.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.640]   Maybe some of you guys have a better system and you can help Victoria out with that.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.320]   I hope these ideas have been useful to you.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.640]   I know some of these things are a little bit conceptual but I think they're powerful.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.320]   Just to reiterate, three major budgets, time, food, and money.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.680]   There are three major stages that we go through.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.960]   First stage is getting an awareness.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960]   Got to start with getting awareness.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.160]   If you don't have awareness about one of those aspects of your life, start with just
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]   getting awareness.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.160]   Don't try to plan.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.360]   Just get aware.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.760]   Then try to do some proactive planning.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.200]   If you need or want big results, do very tight proactive planning.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.080]   If you just need OK results, then do looser proactive planning.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.520]   Do proactive planning with appropriate detail.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.560]   Number three, set up a system of ongoing controls with an appropriate level of relaxation.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.280]   If you're getting great results, you don't need to do that tight planning forever.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.080]   If you are – there was somebody I was corresponding with in the Facebook group.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.120]   He said, "Hey, I'm doing great.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.120]   I've done fine.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.120]   I've used Quicken for years.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.760]   Do I really need YNAB?"
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.500]   My answer was no, you don't because you don't need to do that month-to-month planning.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.560]   You just need to have a vague idea of, "OK, in 2016, here's how much money I'm going
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560]   to make.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560]   We're going to spend about this much.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.680]   We're going to save about this much.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.360]   So I know this much about is available."
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.160]   It's my opinion.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:49.240]   You go through phases and you got to get clear on the goals, put in the big rocks, get the
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.380]   tools that are appropriate and make sure that you're having a level of control that's appropriate
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.040]   for what you're trying to do.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.920]   The better the results you want, the tighter you need to make those results because mega
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:04.800]   results come from the most careful, diligent planning but that may not be where you're
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   at.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   So I hope this is useful to you.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.960]   I hope it can inspire you.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.960]   Listen, December is a great time to be doing budgeting because you can start with a fresh
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.200]   years of data, a fresh month.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.200]   It's just great.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.880]   So this show is going on December 17th.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.440]   If you're not using a system, start with something.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.440]   Sign up for Tiller.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.240]   I think they still have the free code there.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.560]   Maybe they still have the two-month code working.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]   Go to tillerhq.com/radical.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560]   Tillerhq.com/radical.

[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   You're getting the idea.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   But try something and start working on it and don't be scared if it doesn't work.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   I'm not going to say it's a bad idea.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   I'm just saying that it's a good idea.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   I'm not saying that it's a bad idea.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:56.960]   I'm just saying that it's a good idea.
