[00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.740]   Man, as y'all know, Denver was such a big part of my life.
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.000]   You know, that's where I grew up, pretty much straight from high school.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.460]   I didn't spend a lot of time in college, pretty much went straight to Denver.
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.140]   So that's where I grew up, you know, the fans accepted me.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.420]   And I got a lot of love for Denver.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.780]   When I left to go to Brooklyn, they gave me all these jerseys, all my leftover unis.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.680]   And it was tough to look at, you know, through the years, all these different unis that I got to play in.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.460]   And do my thing, and you know what I mean?
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.200]   But I'm no longer a Denver Nugget.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.300]   So what we're going to do is a little giveaway.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.140]   I got all types of different unis right here.
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.340]   And I'm going to be doing a giveaway for Denver fans that still rock with me, you know.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.660]   Even though I'm no longer a Denver Nugget, y'all will always be in my heart.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.640]   And so I'm doing a little giveaway, because I know some Denver fans that would love to rock.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.420]   You know, one of these unis.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.060]   A lot of them got the championship logo on there, as you can see.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.620]   So these are some special jerseys.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.620]   I'm probably going to give away about 10 to 15 unis, man.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.500]   I got a lot in here.
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.100]   These are all my unis from over the years.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.400]   I got a bunch of them.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.400]   So we're going to do a little giveaway, and I'm going to pick some of you guys to give some unis to.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:39.460]   We're still coming up with the requirements to enter the chance to get one of these unis, but so far what I'm thinking is you're going to have to follow me on all platforms.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.480]   TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and then from there, we're going to have some other requirements that I'm still thinking on.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.900]   So I appreciate you Denver fans.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.420]   I appreciate you guys so much.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.400]   You guys mean the world to me, and I'm looking forward to doing this giveaway.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.440]   Bye.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.480]   Bye.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   Bye.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   Bye.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   Bye.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.480]   Bye.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.540]   you
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.320]   I'll see you next time.
