[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.360]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.760]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.040]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.360]   You're probably already familiar
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.140]   with our guest today, Robyn Arzon.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.260]   She's the head instructor
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.000]   and leads fitness programming at Peloton.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.640]   She's also an ultra marathoner,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.600]   two-time New York Times bestselling author,
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.800]   who's made it her life's mission to redefine
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800]   and rethink possibility through movement.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.620]   Today, we're gonna talk about everything related
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.680]   to fitness, exercise, and training,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.520]   but we're also gonna dive into motivation,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.480]   mental strength, designing an ideal life,
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.660]   and so much more.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.440]   I've taken hundreds of classes with Robyn,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.320]   and I'm really excited for this episode.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.420]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.760]   Yesterday was Giving Tuesday,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.200]   and while I truly believe that any gift you give
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.480]   to charity is amazing, it's unfortunate
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.240]   that I see so many people giving cash instead of stock,
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.700]   which is just a lost opportunity to be more optimized.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.840]   For example, if you give a charity $1,000 cash,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.800]   they get $1,000, and you get $1,000 deduction on your taxes.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.520]   However, if you give $1,000 of a stock you bought
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.800]   for $100 years ago, well,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.720]   that stock might only be worth $700 to you
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.160]   after you factor in the taxes you owe on capital gains.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.420]   But charities don't pay those capital gains,
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.320]   so they get the full $1,000,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.920]   and you get to deduct the full $1,000 on your taxes.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.120]   And when you factor in the tax savings and the deduction,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.960]   it means that a $1,000 donation
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.400]   could only cost you a few hundred dollars,
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.360]   which I hope encourages you to be even more generous.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.480]   Not every charity makes this easy or even possible.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.660]   So if you wanna do what I did,
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.700]   you can just open up an account with our sponsor, Daffy.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.200]   They make it so easy to set up
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.560]   a special tax-advantaged account called a donor-advised fund
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.360]   and make stock contributions to that account.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.000]   Then you can use those contributions
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.440]   to give to any charities you want on your own timeline.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.200]   They even have an awesome calculator
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.600]   I'll link to in the show notes
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.360]   to see the difference between donating cash and stock.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.680]   And if you sign up at allthehacks.com/daffy,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.660]   you'll not only be supporting the show,
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.880]   but you'll also get a free $25
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.920]   to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.160]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy,
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.000]   D-A-F-F-Y, for a better way to give.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.160]   - Robin, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.320]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.280]   - You went from a lawyer who didn't really run
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.880]   to 27 marathons, a career in fitness.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   What has been the biggest lesson you've learned
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   during that transformation that might be helpful
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.800]   for someone who feels a bit more like your former self?
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   - Ooh, my former self.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.240]   The first thing that came to mind
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.400]   is the fact that slowing down is actually a strength.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.720]   I don't actually know if my former self needed that advice.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.040]   It's more my current supercharged self.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.420]   So maybe that will resonate to some aspects
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.260]   of your audience.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.100]   I have a feeling it will.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.500]   But the reason I say that is because
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.240]   I think there's more nuance to my hustle now.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.520]   And I realize that I can zoom out enough
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.440]   and have the confidence to pull back at points.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.680]   And then that kind of supercharges me
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.420]   once I'm back into full throttle.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.220]   One example being the postpartum period,
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.600]   I slowed down my workouts quite a bit.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.440]   And I was like, wow, slowing down is actually a strength.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.200]   It actually takes a level of confidence.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.720]   But my former self, as I was getting into it,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.280]   when I was still a corporate litigator
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.320]   and getting into marathons and ultra marathons,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.120]   was to trust the struggle.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.280]   That discomfort that we feel,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.080]   whether it's a physical workout
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.640]   or whether we're stretching ourselves
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.360]   mentally, emotionally, in business or otherwise,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.640]   to protect ourselves, right?
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.440]   That gut instinct of, oh wait, this is new, this is scary,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.700]   this is uncomfortable, can paralyze us.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.500]   And what ritualizing discomfort does,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.520]   either in the form of a Peloton workout with me
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.160]   or whatever it is, however we ritualize discomfort,
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.760]   it actually primes our system to say like,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   oh, I've been here before.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.400]   Even if the stimuli changes, that is exciting to me.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.920]   So I think I would tell my former self
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.840]   or anyone who feels like they're in a plateau,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.440]   ritualize the discomfort.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.160]   And I mean, literally, schedule it, keep showing up,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.000]   keep getting uncomfortable every day.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.400]   - I did an interview with someone who said
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.160]   she doesn't know that the medical science
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.200]   says anything about cold therapy,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.680]   but she turns the shower on cold every single time
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.080]   and jumps in just 'cause she wants
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.680]   to feel uncomfortable every day to know that she can.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.920]   - Great example of an accessible way to achieve that.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.200]   So I know fitness was a big part of that transformation
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.040]   and you've gone on to talk a lot
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.220]   about designing a life beyond just fitness.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.320]   So I wanna start at the fitness area
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.040]   because as an optimizer, and I think a lot of people are,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.560]   when I think about that, I've heard you talk
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.980]   about movement being so important.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.000]   I feel like I get so lost in this world
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.480]   of like everything I could do,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.000]   wanting to make sure it's all perfect
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.440]   and that getting in the way of actually just going.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.960]   And I'm sure your advice to me would be like,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.200]   shut up, just go and get the thing done.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   But maybe we could do like a quick 101, 201 on fitness
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.280]   to try to set aside some of that confusion
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.080]   so people can jump in stronger.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.920]   - Yeah.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.140]   - The biggest question that I feel almost ridiculous asking
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.980]   is there's these two modes.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.840]   You're doing cardio, you're doing strength.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.220]   Sometimes I personally get lost in this world
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.440]   of you've got two or three days, four days a week.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.160]   How do you even think about what to prioritize?
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.520]   - Oh gosh, the answer, like a lot of these hypotheticals,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.360]   it depends.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.140]   There are a lot of factors that would inform
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.440]   how somebody should be training, should be moving,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.080]   where they're starting from, where they want to end up,
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.960]   what their goal is.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   But I would say kind of a general effective dose is both.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.840]   I personally prioritize as the ground floor strength training
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.440]   and I mean going heavy with deadlift, squat, bench press.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.000]   So that's at least three strength workouts a week forever.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.080]   Strength takes years to build.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.160]   And the cool thing is that your body really remembers
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.580]   from a muscular perspective that training.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.780]   So your conditioning, you get back faster
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.100]   and you also lose faster.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.340]   Really, really important, obviously,
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.420]   for cardiovascular health.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.020]   And I love HIIT and Tabata and that kind of interval work.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.260]   So unless I'm marathon training
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.100]   or have a distance race in the future,
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.220]   a typical week for me,
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.420]   and I recognize that I'm not necessarily the average person
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.660]   'cause I'm literally paid to train myself,
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.460]   but I have at least four days a week of strength training
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.460]   and that includes Peloton classes also with dumbbells
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.380]   and more traditional accessory work.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.580]   That includes barbell work,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.980]   heavy lifting work, as I mentioned.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.380]   So that's at least four days a week.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.620]   And then I have at least four sessions a week
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.620]   of interval training on the bike,
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.960]   hill climbing on the bike,
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.420]   so that I'm getting kind of power and speed there.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.060]   And then for my own running training,
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.260]   I always have at least one or two speed sessions a week
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.100]   and usually one distance run.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.300]   And distance for me will be anything from 60 minutes
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.780]   to two hours when I'm not marathon training.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.020]   And then obviously marathon training, it's three hours plus.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.060]   And the volume of running takes over
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.860]   a little bit of the bike when I'm not teaching.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.180]   But that's at least eight sessions.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.780]   And of course, some days I'm doing two days
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.980]   and I try to carve out at least one day for recovery.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.440]   Recovery for me is active.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.180]   I'm still getting 10 to 12,000 steps a day,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.300]   but I know my body well enough to know
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.500]   what's gonna fatigue it
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.860]   and what is gonna keep it at that baseline.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.420]   Because the more you can push your limit
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.820]   but still recover within 24 to 36 hours,
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.260]   the more training you're gonna be able to get
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.780]   in a seven day micro cycle.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.380]   The very short answer to your question
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.260]   is I would say minimum three days a week of strength
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260]   and two to three, ideally, sessions of cardio.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.780]   But the strength can be a little bit more
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.260]   in terms of numbers per week
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.860]   than the cycling or the running,
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.140]   especially if you're doing it in a 20 minute HIIT session,
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.100]   20 minute Tabata.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.820]   Like that is really gonna build
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.500]   your cardiovascular abilities.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.940]   And then there's that zone two cardio
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.820]   that is also really important for heart health.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.660]   But I think in terms of like training technique,
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.220]   the more technical approaches to training,
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.340]   it's strength and HIIT Tabata at least twice a week.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.420]   - It's funny 'cause I had these roommates in college
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.580]   and they would always go to the gym nonstop.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.340]   And they're like, we wanna be huge, we wanna be ripped.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.660]   And I think in my mind, ever since then,
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.100]   I've been like, well, I don't care about
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.900]   looking like these dudes look like.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.460]   And it's been like, strength doesn't matter
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.740]   'cause I don't wanna be like them.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.620]   And I feel like I've ignored it
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.420]   to a level that's probably not healthy.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.740]   - Strength does matter.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.460]   In the infinite movement game, I think strength,
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.940]   this is assuming you are already walking,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.140]   you already do that basic element
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.660]   of you know how to get your heart rate up.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.820]   You know, like I think your audience already gets it.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.940]   If they know what Peloton is,
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.260]   like you probably have some minimum dose
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.740]   of a movement practice.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.180]   What I find is that people often go too hard on easy days
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.420]   and too easy on hard days.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.460]   So that's another variable that we need to consider
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.300]   that first of all, yes, strength does matter.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.060]   And it's one of the most effective ways
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.940]   to armor ourselves for the infinite game.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.500]   You know, it's like range of motion,
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.020]   being able to get up off the floor.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.780]   Like there are really basic tests that we can do.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.820]   And Kelly Starrett in his latest book
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.980]   has great examples of that and really practical ways.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.460]   It's literally like, can you take off your shoe
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.620]   and pick it up off the floor?
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.620]   Like single leg work, you'll find, you know,
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.940]   in the blue zones, like one of the ways that, you know,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.580]   we can take from those learnings
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.380]   is literally just spending more time on the floor.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.700]   Like I spend time on the floor with my kid.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.260]   Like I don't bring her up on the couch.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.380]   I get down to her level for a lot of reasons.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.820]   I'm a huge proponent of strength
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.700]   and going heavy enough in the strength work
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.980]   once you get the form down,
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.820]   unless you're in a rehabilitation setting
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.820]   or you're doing a very specific movement
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.020]   that requires lightweight.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.900]   I'm a huge proponent of going to living in that 70 to 85%
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   of your working max for most sets.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.140]   - If someone doesn't have a good sense
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.860]   of what they should be doing for strength,
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.500]   they're like, okay, you've convinced me.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.140]   Is it home, gym?
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.980]   Can you do it?
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.820]   Class, no class?
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.780]   Do you need an instructor to get the form down?
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.900]   What's the best way for someone
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.980]   to just get started with strength training?
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.820]   - We have beginner programs at Peloton
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.780]   that are prescriptive and progressively overload
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.620]   from week to week.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.060]   Indie Spear has a great program.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.540]   Olivia Amato and Maddie Nijakama
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.260]   created a beginner program specifically.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.180]   I do think a trainer having somebody
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.020]   to model the movement is important
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.620]   as you're learning the basic squat, chest press, deadlift.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.780]   But generally speaking, when you're getting into,
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.020]   for example, let's say you're working for 30 seconds
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.740]   or you're doing 10 reps of something.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.580]   By the last 10 or 20% of whatever it is you're doing,
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.400]   either for time or for reps, should feel tough.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.140]   Not so tough that you unravel
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.860]   and you can barely pick up the weight.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.220]   I mean, there are places for that in lifting,
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.180]   but not for most general population folks
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.900]   needing to go there, especially not in the beginning,
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.060]   but it should feel tough.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.660]   If you've been throwing around
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.380]   the same 10 pound weight for six months,
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.160]   put the volume up a little louder.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.980]   It's not it, you're not doing it.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.080]   You might get sweaty.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.780]   You might feel like you achieved something,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.220]   but you are not creating the right stimulus.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.420]   - Now that I have kids, I wanna be more focused at work
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.180]   so I can spend more time with them
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.320]   and I wanna have a stronger immune system
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.580]   for all the crap they bring home from school,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.280]   which is why if you're a longtime listener,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.520]   you might know I've been drinking AG1 for about two years.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.200]   When I started drinking AG1 daily,
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.800]   it was to help with daily nutrition,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.520]   but I also felt a real difference
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.280]   in the energy I had every day,
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.440]   so it's been in my routine ever since.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.760]   And that's because AG1
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.680]   is a foundational nutrition supplement
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.760]   that supports your body's universal needs
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.320]   like gut optimization, stress management, and immune support.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.940]   Since 2010, AG1 has led the future
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.460]   of foundational nutrition,
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.460]   continuously refining their formula
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.220]   to create a smarter, better way
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.420]   to elevate your baseline health.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.620]   Most of all, I love that AG1 takes all the guesswork
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.940]   out of trying to combine the right supplements
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.160]   and provide multiple products in one easy scoop.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.740]   Not to mention it tastes great, especially shaken with ice,
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.940]   which is why I trust it to provide my body
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.620]   the support it needs daily,
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.140]   and also why I'm excited
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.440]   that they've been a partner of the show for so long.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.160]   If you wanna take ownership of your health,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.920]   it starts with AG1.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.720]   Try AG1 and get a free one-year supply
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.000]   of vitamin D3K2 and five free AG1 travel packs
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.400]   with your first purchase.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.000]   Go to allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.440]   That's allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   Check it out.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.880]   Give yourself the gift of insane savings this holiday season
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.700]   with Mint Mobile's best wireless deal of the year.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.460]   Right now, when you switch to Mint Mobile
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.460]   and buy any three-month plan,
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.340]   you get another three months for free.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.940]   That's six months of premium wireless service
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.540]   for half the cost.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.380]   For us and the line we're getting for our new au pair,
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.300]   we'll be saving hundreds of dollars over six months
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.340]   with Mint Mobile,
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.260]   compared to what we would have been stuck paying
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.900]   if we had stayed on our old Verizon plan,
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.820]   which is why I'm so excited to be partnering
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.660]   with them today.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.800]   All Mint Mobile plans come with unlimited talk, text,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.200]   and high-speed data delivered
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.760]   on the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.920]   Best of all, Mint Mobile lets you order
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.240]   and activate new lines from home
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.000]   on your existing phone using eSIMS,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.940]   and because they're online only,
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.360]   they eliminate the traditional cost of retail
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.800]   and can pass that savings on to you.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.780]   Seriously, I can't think of a better gift
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.880]   than turning an overpriced wireless bill
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.040]   into just $15 a month with Mint Mobile.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.580]   Switch to Mint Mobile and get premium wireless service
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.500]   starting at just 15 bucks a month,
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.860]   and for a limited time,
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.020]   buy any three-month Mint Mobile plan
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   and get three more months free
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.400]   by going to allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.540]   That's allthehacks.com/M-I-N-T-Mobile.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.900]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.380]   at allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.980]   Okay, so we can dial things up to keep pushing ourselves.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.580]   How important is variety?
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.500]   Like if I come up with a strength plan
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.660]   or maybe I even find a Peloton strength class I like,
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.280]   can I just do that three days a week
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.020]   or is it really important to be doing different things,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.600]   obviously hitting all muscle groups,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.180]   but can I just do the same one or two routines each week
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.580]   and not worry about having to change it up more than that?
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.780]   - The body loves repetition,
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.780]   and what you're changing in very small variables
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.340]   are the number of reps, the amount of weight, right?
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.300]   So there are a lot of ways
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.220]   to create that progressive overload effect.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.300]   So the answer is yes, you can absolutely repeat workouts.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.000]   I actually think that is the best way,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.620]   and that's why the programs that we've built
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.060]   incorporate that principle.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.780]   You can take any strength class with Peloton
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.420]   and it's gonna be a solid class,
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.860]   full body, upper body, lower body,
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.980]   but the key is if you find a class that you really like,
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.940]   take that same class once or twice a week,
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.940]   depending on whatever the class is,
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.140]   for four weeks, for six weeks, and then change it up.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.180]   I think most folks respond pretty well
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.140]   to a four to six week cycle.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.900]   You refresh and you adapt something, some element,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.940]   whether it's the amount of reps you're doing
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.120]   in a given period, whether it's the amount of weight,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.660]   you certainly could change the movements,
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.440]   but your body takes a few weeks
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.860]   and a consistent repetition for it to start to respond
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.300]   and grow and strengthen.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.180]   - And on the cardio side, you mentioned HIIT and Tabata.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.340]   How do you think about the I'm gonna go on a run
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.480]   for 30 minutes at a pace I can handle
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.820]   versus layering in some of those kind of accelerations,
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.740]   whether it's on a bike or running, I guess?
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.340]   - That is a really important place to start
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.980]   of 30 minutes of sustained effort
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.980]   using a conversational pace, right?
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.580]   So I do love the higher intensity efforts,
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.260]   but most folks aren't gonna start there and they shouldn't.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.660]   When I started running, it was actually a walk-run method
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.500]   and I would literally jog two blocks, walk a block,
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.740]   and it was like, okay, I'm just gonna go to the next light.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.700]   And I didn't know I was doing intervals at the time,
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.520]   but it was, there were a form of intervals,
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.100]   but I wasn't trying to demolish myself in the jog.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.500]   It was literally just slightly faster than a block.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.820]   That's a great place to start.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.460]   30 minutes three times a week
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.260]   is a really, really good goal.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.500]   That sustained effort approach is important.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.140]   That's more of the zone two cardio
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.780]   that we do all need for heart health,
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.860]   but you don't wanna live there indefinitely.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.460]   And one way to start to amp it up in a run, for example,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.620]   is to do striders.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.740]   It's 15, 20 seconds of an eight out of 10 effort.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.300]   You're definitely pushing it,
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.300]   but you could give more if you had to.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.860]   And you tack that on to the end of the run.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.020]   So let's say in your last five minutes
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.740]   of a 30-minute run where for the most of the workout,
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.860]   you could talk, you could sing along to Beyonce
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.540]   or whoever it is you're listening to in your ears.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.860]   For me, it's Beyonce or Taylor or M.O.P.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.940]   if you're a '90s hip hop man.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.360]   But then at the end, in those last five minutes,
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.780]   you set a watch or for the chorus,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.200]   you're cooking and then you get back to that jog.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.020]   And those striders remind your body
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.980]   and they activate different types of muscle fibers
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.940]   to remind your body, this is what it feels like to run fast.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.060]   And you will be uncomfortable
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.340]   and you have to get acquainted with that discomfort.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.420]   And then there's a period of time usually for folks
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.620]   where you're like, oh, wow, I like that.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.060]   And then they go maybe a little bit too far into that realm
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.900]   where every run becomes crushing intervals
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.580]   and you don't want the pendulum to swing that far either.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.260]   So I would say at least once a week,
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.220]   you wanna choose a run or a ride where you're like,
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.620]   I'm going hard in the paint today.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.120]   I'm working eight out of 10 when it's work time,
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.180]   when it's effort time.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.060]   That is really important because we want that tempo pace,
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.620]   we want that uncomfortable pace.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.700]   It doesn't have to be all out, but there are huge,
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.060]   huge benefits to that.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.660]   - One of the most motivating things for me
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.540]   when it comes to biking or running
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.060]   is like competing with my own records or friends
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.260]   or things like that, which is why Peloton's been great
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.420]   for me on the bike.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.900]   I'm curious, like, am I crazy to every time
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.460]   be like out there saying, can I beat the distance I ran
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.780]   in 30 minutes last time?
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.260]   Is it good to infuse some days where it's like,
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.700]   don't focus on that?
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.220]   - Yes, you should.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.020]   If you think about the best athletes in the world,
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.780]   they're actually very rarely competing.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.420]   They're very rarely going to that level.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.180]   When you're starting out, the PRs happen more readily
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.660]   'cause when you're consistently working out,
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.500]   you've never consistently worked out before,
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.660]   your body's making those adaptations.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.060]   Once you've been training for a while,
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   and you start to hit that upper echelon
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.500]   of your quote unquote perceived ceiling
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.700]   or actual physical ceiling, it doesn't really exist,
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.860]   but we can always nudge it up.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.780]   But that nudging that ceiling up
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.620]   starts to become a little tougher.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.820]   And the PRs are hard won,
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.660]   but not every single workout should be that.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.260]   Use the leaderboard, whatever motivates you.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.460]   If that's what's getting you on the bike,
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.820]   and you're like, I'm hard charging for so-and-so today,
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.420]   I mean, do it, but I would rather somebody choose
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.940]   consistency and layer on intensity
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.320]   rather than go for intensity and burnout.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.320]   So for me, I can throttle at 85% for a long, long time,
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.260]   but I know my body, but I still choose workouts
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.340]   where I'm like, this is it.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.540]   If I'm laid out on the floor, I'm okay with that.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.980]   But most of my workouts aren't like that.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.300]   Most of my workouts, I'm hovering at that eight,
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.420]   maybe nine out of 10.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.660]   It's very rarely I'm going to a true max.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.260]   - And you talked about rest and recovery.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.820]   How do you think about what to do
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.580]   to make sure your body recovers
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.420]   other than just kind of take a day off?
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.760]   - This is where you have to be in tune
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.500]   with how your body is feeling.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.020]   What does your body respond to?
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.180]   What foods are you eating?
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.140]   Fueling intentionally, getting sleep,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.060]   and drinking water are the basics.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.380]   Is it dope if somebody has a hyperbaric chamber?
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.120]   I mean, go you, that's awesome.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.220]   You are oxygenated as hell, but just go to sleep.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.380]   Get off your freaking phone and go to bed.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.180]   You know, it's not fancy.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.020]   It's just what you do consistently.
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.900]   - You said fuel.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.220]   How important is nutrition
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.700]   and what you're eating to all of this?
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.540]   - Hugely.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.860]   Fueling intentionally, noticing how your body reacts
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.780]   to certain foods is massive.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.700]   It is not normal at 3 p.m. every day
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.000]   to feel like you just can't get through the next hour
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.280]   without a Herculean dose of caffeine.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.380]   Those adaptations are, I think in some cases,
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.940]   tougher because food is so deeply personal.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.620]   I mean, the act of eating, it's an intimate thing to do.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.740]   So I get it.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.220]   Those changes can be really tough,
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.300]   but that is what we call a keystone habit.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.660]   How you fuel, how you move,
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.820]   impacts almost every other area of your life.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.640]   - And what do you think some of the most common ways
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.340]   people are not doing that well when it comes to food
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.780]   and what they're fueling their body with?
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.420]   - I'll speak from my own perspective
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.020]   'cause there's obviously nutritionists, dieticians,
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.380]   all that could inform from a more medical perspective,
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.580]   but the key for me is eating most of the time
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.100]   whole and unprocessed foods.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.580]   And like most of what we have access to is processed.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.740]   Like if it comes in a box,
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.620]   it's been processed in some way, shape, or form.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.900]   I'm not saying, I mean, I get stuff from Whole Foods
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.780]   and I pull it off the shelf.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.580]   I open boxes to eat my food, right?
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.620]   Not everything is like a sprig of parsley and broccoli,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.020]   but most of my foods I do try to prepare
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.900]   and cook in the kitchen.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.580]   And I find that getting into a habit of preparing foods,
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.640]   even bulk preparing a handful of things
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.260]   and then supplementing with what you have
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.500]   to ease throughout your day goes a long way.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.900]   For me, I'm a plant-based athlete.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.220]   I don't consume any meat or dairy
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.820]   and making sure that I'm getting protein is important.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.180]   So plants have protein.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.900]   A lot of folks are surprised to hear that,
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.020]   but it's making sure that I'm getting plant-based protein.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.140]   For me, it's at least one gram per pound of body weight
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.540]   and if not more, and I'm able to do that with smoothies,
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.100]   with plants, legumes, nuts, beans,
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.740]   and then I'll make my own seitan.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.220]   I batch prepare that, so I always have it in the fridge.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.260]   Tempeh, soy, my family is not gluten sensitive,
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.700]   so that's how we rock.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.460]   - And the only other thing we didn't talk about was timing.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.100]   How do you think about when to fit all these workouts in?
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.180]   Is it personal or is it do it first thing in the morning?
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.500]   - You schedule it when you can,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.020]   but you schedule it like an appointment.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.840]   And I mean, you schedule it like an appointment,
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.460]   like your boss would fire you,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.320]   like your business partner would be out,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.500]   like your partner is shutting it down.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.540]   I schedule my workouts, and I mean my own personal workouts,
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.340]   not when I'm literally paid to be there,
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.060]   like it's the most important meeting I have.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.020]   And you have to be nimble, life happens,
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.700]   kids happen, stuff happens, but then you shift it
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.140]   and you have to be adaptable.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.540]   Maybe that 45 minute workout turns into 20 minutes.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.620]   I've had, literally before Zoom calls,
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.640]   been like, oh my gosh, the window that I had,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.180]   I've done burpees and then got onto a podcast like this
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.380]   and just been like, okay, I did it.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.100]   I did four minutes of burpees, here we are.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.320]   And there are always little games
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.540]   that we can kind of play with ourselves
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.140]   to keep ourselves in it.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.300]   Important will always be put to the side versus urgent.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.860]   Urgent will gobble important.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.560]   Your movement practice is important,
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.220]   but there are probably urgent things
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.340]   that are gonna come up if you don't plan accordingly.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.900]   So that framework that you're putting in
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.580]   the most important things of your life,
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.300]   it better be clear on your calendar
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.440]   'cause you can talk all the talk,
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.340]   you can listen to this podcast a million times in a row.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.820]   If you're not doing it, you're not doing it.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.340]   - I imagine that there are a lot of people listening
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.280]   who are like, yeah, I can put it on my calendar,
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.700]   but it's like, I need that commitment to myself.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.300]   Any advice for people who are like,
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.580]   I really wanna do this,
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.800]   but it just doesn't seem to pick up traction
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.780]   or they go in spurts of, gosh, I was so active in September
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.700]   and then things came along and now all of a sudden,
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.700]   I'm maybe lucky if I run once a week.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.820]   - We have to analyze the roadblocks, right?
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.300]   Is it you've never woken up before 7 a.m.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.420]   and now you're scheduling 5 a.m. workouts?
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.460]   Like, that's probably gonna be a lot of work.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.020]   You wanna make it tougher to make the bad choice.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.900]   You also wanna surround yourself with folks
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.340]   whose default behavior is your desired outcome.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.180]   You wanna run more, hang out with runners.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.960]   You're listening to the running podcast.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.300]   You're reading the running book.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.340]   You're taking the running class with me at Peloton.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.580]   You're following those folks on social media.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.580]   Your ecosystem, your entertainment media diet
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.740]   also is gonna inform how you are feeling like you can act
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.020]   because community is such a linchpin in all of this.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.780]   So is it literally finding your buddy down the road
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.180]   and saying, hey, we're gonna get up in the morning
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.220]   and do this, great.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.980]   Is it finding somebody virtually?
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.780]   I see folks in the Peloton community all the time.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.300]   There are 4 a.m. workout tags.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.740]   There are 5 a.m. workout tags.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.220]   There's the 10 p.m. workout tags.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.360]   There are night shift workers that have found each other.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.660]   I mean, there are ways.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.380]   When you start believing your own BS, be wary.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.100]   When you start telling yourself the story,
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.500]   I don't have time, replace that with it doesn't matter.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.380]   And we have to release ourselves sometimes.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.700]   We have to give ourselves some freedom
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.500]   to release ourselves from the expectation.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.900]   Especially most recently, postpartum, I had this idea,
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.660]   oh my gosh, I wanna do this 60-minute workout,
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.540]   and I had my schedule, and then my toddler and my infant
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.060]   were like, LOL, what are you talking about?
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.140]   And then I would be like, okay, I've got a pocket.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:12.980]   I've got 10 minutes.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.100]   I don't know how long he's gonna sleep,
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.580]   but I'm just gonna do something.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.240]   90% of my workouts were completely interrupted,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.380]   but consistently showing up to that,
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.780]   it moved the needle until I could get back into my routine.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.180]   - It sounds like being flexible is the most important thing.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.940]   I'm thinking vacations are coming up,
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.620]   people are traveling for the holidays.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.660]   If you have set in your mind that your workout
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.220]   is a very specific thing,
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.460]   and if you can't do that specific thing, it's off.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.300]   If you're not staying at one of the hotels
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.180]   that has a Peloton, and you can't work out,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.480]   it sounds like the biggest theme
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.900]   is you've gotta throw that out of the window,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.300]   and say, your goal is to move.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.140]   And like, that's it. - Yes.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.620]   - And if it can't be the perfect movement,
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.620]   it can't be the perfect exercise, who cares?
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.800]   Do something and just check it off the list.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.120]   - 100%, that is.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.440]   It's being nimble.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.960]   You're showing up consistently,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.920]   but you're nimble in the form or the execution.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.000]   That all or nothing approach, that super binary approach,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.960]   and ambitious folks have trouble doing this, right?
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.120]   It's like, but I put it on my calendar,
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.240]   and this is the training plan,
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.840]   and this says I must do this today, right?
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.320]   It's a little bit like of a departure
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.680]   from what we were just talking about.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.960]   They're just shades of gray, right?
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.800]   So it's a departure only in the sense
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.680]   that it's for a temporary period of time.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.440]   Think about the goal, the objective.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.840]   It's your mental health, it's your physical health.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.880]   Maybe for that week or two that you're traveling
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.040]   and you're out of your routine,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.260]   it's not, you know, I'm trying to PR,
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.240]   I'm so focused on my Boston Marathon training
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.520]   or whatever the case is, right?
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.320]   Like, you gotta give yourself a little bit of freedom
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.720]   and zooming out, but there is something that happens,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.440]   particularly over the holidays, that I call the avalanche.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.820]   And it's, you miss one workout,
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.120]   you start eating things you maybe wouldn't eat.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.960]   Listen, I'm all in favor of celebration,
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.240]   but then you create links in the chain
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.440]   where it's like two days becomes five days,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.160]   becomes two weeks, and you're like, oh, whatever, who cares?
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.240]   Get the reins back.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.840]   Talk to yourself like you would a friend.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.680]   That apathy is what becomes our rabbit hole.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.640]   Care enough to break the chain.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.760]   For me, it's no more than two days of stuff
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.880]   that is totally out of my normal wheelhouse.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.560]   And then I'm getting back to something
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.840]   that makes me feel like myself,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.580]   and that's always intentional movement,
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.400]   even if that movement looks very, very different
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.840]   than my normal training schedule.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.720]   - You've posted about this challenge in December
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.760]   to get everyone moving.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.800]   I think it's run three miles or move for 30 minutes.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.200]   - Yes, every day from December 1st to December 31st,
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.920]   three for 31 challenge.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.400]   - It's great 'cause I think so many people think,
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.960]   I'll do it in January, I'll do it in January,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.440]   and you're like, no, no, no, let's back it up.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.880]   Do it during the hardest time,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.720]   and then you can easily do it in January.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.320]   - Yes, if you can commit to yourself for 31 days
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.840]   for what most folks is the busiest time of year,
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.920]   you can always do it.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.040]   And the whole point of the challenge,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.680]   yes, it's getting some folks moving for the first time,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.360]   but most of the folks who are participating
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.640]   have some kind of movement practice,
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.520]   are kind of aware of their routines and habit building.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.360]   They've probably read "Atomic Habits."
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.120]   These aren't new concepts to most of the folks
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.160]   who are participating.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.120]   It is the idea that for 31 days,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.880]   when the world is asking a lot of you,
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.960]   you choose yourself and you show up consistently.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.640]   So that is the beauty of it.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.040]   It's been 11 years now that we've been doing this challenge.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.360]   Tens of thousands of folks have participated at this point,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.080]   and I've seen lives change because of it.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.600]   - It's funny 'cause as I thought about it,
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.760]   I took the commitment to the exercise as one order,
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.160]   and I thought about how to motivate myself.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.080]   And I wanna talk a little bit about like mental toughness,
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.840]   but saying I wanna work out every day
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.200]   is actually maybe for me personally,
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.280]   not as motivating as saying,
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.560]   I'm gonna say I'm gonna work out every day,
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.080]   and I wanna be the person that does what I said.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.480]   So it's like, it's actually the reason I'm gonna do it
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.240]   might not be that I need to work out for 31 days straight.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.720]   It's that if I'm gonna commit to this,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.200]   I just wanna be the kind of person
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.680]   that's gonna do the thing I commit to.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.520]   I have two kids.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.640]   I want them to know that if I say I'm gonna do this,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.480]   I'm gonna do it.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.800]   And I found that reframing things like a exercise routine
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.720]   as making the commitment and holding yourself accountable
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.600]   to the kind of person that follows through
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.960]   on their commitments is like a mental trick
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.840]   that works better than doing the thing just to do the thing.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.240]   - Oh my gosh, I love that so much.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.840]   That's the next level, right?
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.920]   So our values are creating our habits.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.760]   Our habits are creating our identities.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.440]   You need to consistently engage in a habit for long enough
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.960]   for it to inform your identity.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.000]   - I am now just someone who shows up and slays my workout.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.160]   Even on the days where I'm feeling like 5%,
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.480]   I'm giving 100% of the 5% that I have.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.320]   And that becomes that identity.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.000]   The promises that we keep to ourselves,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.640]   the conversation that we're having with ourselves
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.800]   is the most important conversation we are gonna have.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.320]   That's such an amazing thing to share
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.600]   because I do believe that that is the goal,
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.160]   is personalizing it enough.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.720]   You make it matter, you make it happen.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.480]   - Some people would say I can't make exercise
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.680]   a part of my identity until it's a habit.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.560]   And I would argue, maybe you can just say,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.640]   nope, as of tomorrow, I am the kind of person
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.800]   who works out four days a week.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.200]   Post about it, tell your friends.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.360]   You can make something your identity before you do it.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.080]   And once it's there, then it's like,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.200]   well, now I'm disrespecting my identity by not doing it.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.840]   So I'm just trying to set myself up
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.040]   for a little bit more success.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.360]   So I'll say it here, that in December,
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.160]   I am the kind of person who's going to move every day
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.000]   for 31 days.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.640]   So now I can't not do it.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.840]   - Yep, Chris, we heard it here first.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.000]   And this really, this is a perfect example
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.640]   of the principles that we just talked about
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.240]   of being adaptable, of analyzing the roadblocks.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.440]   If you know that you're traveling two days before a holiday,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.360]   if you know you're gonna be on a long flight,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   in the car all day, what's your plan?
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.480]   I've done 3 for 31 for 11 years in a row.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.240]   I've done miles on staircases and hotel rooms
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.760]   before 5 a.m. flights.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.040]   I have ran up and down airport terminals
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.640]   looking like a wild woman and gotten my steps in.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.720]   I have been the person walking up and down a flight.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.560]   What's your plan?
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.280]   And can you make it bite-size, right?
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.120]   So let's say you're doing
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.680]   the 30 minutes of movement approach.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.520]   You can carve out a few five-minute,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.880]   10-minute chunks in a day.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.720]   Don't tell me you can't.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.080]   How many times were you on Instagram?
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:39.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.760]   Give me a break.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.120]   So it's analyzing the roadblocks
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.600]   and it's figuring out who we are at the end of it
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.720]   and who we wanna be.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.280]   We get to meet that version of ourselves.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.600]   And for some folks that might feel like
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.200]   that's very esoteric, that's heady,
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.280]   that supercharges me.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.800]   'Cause I want Robin on 12/31 to be like,
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.680]   "Oh yeah, January 1st, we've been doing this.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.040]   "This is just another day."
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.400]   - With the market always feeling uncertain
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.360]   and interest rates at all-time highs,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.280]   the only thing I feel I know for certain
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.320]   is the importance of diversification.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.680]   And one way I diversify my portfolio
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.960]   is with our longtime sponsor, Masterworks,
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.720]   the art investing platform.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.080]   Now, I know art investing is unusual,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.040]   even though I've talked about it on the show.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.400]   But one thing I like about it
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.560]   is that data from UBS shows private assets like fine art
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.880]   can be especially valuable when looking for low correlation
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   as they've historically moved independent of stocks.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.760]   So, like I said, I invest with Masterworks myself,
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.520]   and it's been impressive to see their history
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   of performance stretch over multiple years now.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.360]   They've had 16 successful exits to date,
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.520]   netting their investors annualized returns of 10, 17,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.000]   and even 35% this year, just to name a few.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.640]   They've also recently launched pieces
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.840]   from artists like Banksy and Basquiat,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.640]   and now have over 800 million in assets under management.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.160]   So come join Masterworks' over 800,000 users.

[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.360]   Past performance is not indicative of future returns.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.000]   All investing involves risk.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.680]   See important reg A disclosures
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.860]   and aggregate advisory performance at masterworks.com/cd.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.400]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.040]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.800]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.240]   being proactive about this year
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.920]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.600]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.760]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.120]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.600]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.200]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.640]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.240]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.080]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.800]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.040]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.960]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.160]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.280]   And best of all, you can have this transparent,
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.040]   open communication with your team
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.960]   in whatever way works best for you,
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.320]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.480]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.760]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.840]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.360]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.160]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.040]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.920]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.520]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.400]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.880]   And as an AllTheHacks listener,

[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.760]   - You mentioned a couple of flights, travel.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.680]   We both have kids.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.880]   I think I'm a year ahead of you
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.600]   with a one-year-old and a three-year-old,
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.080]   which brings all kinds of variables
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.400]   and change schedules and demands to you.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.760]   How have you adapted this movement, exercise, fitness,
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.080]   life to a world with two children?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.920]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.680]   Well, the jogging stroller helps.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.080]   Being able to have them just physically
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.880]   along for the ride is helpful.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.720]   That's one.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.880]   So that's more when I have my toddler.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.120]   My infant isn't able to go on the jogging stroller yet.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.520]   And then it's tag-teaming.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.880]   Thankfully, my husband and I are really, really aligned
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.720]   on our goals.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.920]   His movement practice is important.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.400]   My movement practice is important.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.120]   And we will just figure it out.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.520]   It's like I have the kids,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.000]   and then he runs and does a workout.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.400]   And then again, it's being adaptable.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.300]   I would love to go for a 60-minute leisurely run
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.700]   followed by a core work, and then breath work,
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.300]   and then the cold plunge.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.960]   And it's like, no, I'm not doing that.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.320]   Maybe it's a 20-minute hit run.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.600]   Maybe it's 15 minutes.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.280]   And then using the work-back approach.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.600]   This is the time that I have.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.780]   How can I fill it most intentionally
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.260]   to maximize those minutes?
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.860]   And then planning my week, right?
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.860]   So if I know, let's say, the workout that I'm gonna get
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.040]   on the family road trip or in the hotel
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.400]   is gonna look very, very different,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.920]   then before I leave, I'll try to get in
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.960]   my barbell lifting sessions, or my long run,
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.400]   or whatever it is I'm trying to get in.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.640]   That way, on the weekend, if it's only body weight work,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.600]   or if it's a very quick something
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.120]   on the Peloton hardware or the app,
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.560]   you know, I'm kind of planning for that.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.200]   Some days, it just goes out the window.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.600]   I remember last holiday, I was pregnant,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.280]   and my toddler, I think, was in a crib
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.840]   in the bathroom, or it was an absurd hotel setup.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.660]   We had stuff over the windows.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.720]   It looked very disturbing, I'm sure,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.800]   to somebody who would just walk in.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.060]   But time went away from us.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:38.900]   We had to leave.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.880]   I had 20 minutes to shower, get dressed,
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.720]   have her ready, and I literally just set a timer,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.840]   and I did a three-minute AMRAP of burpees,
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.360]   and I've never done burpees faster,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.920]   and that is still kind of my record
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.480]   for three minutes of burpees because I was like,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.400]   I just need to do this for my own mental health.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.600]   And that is just an example of, like,
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.000]   if you only have a few minutes, take the few minutes.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.040]   The paralysis that you're giving yourself
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.320]   through the analysis, just go and do it,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.000]   even if it looks different than what you wished.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.040]   And it's telling the folks in your lives
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.320]   how important your movement practice is for you.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.800]   You know, if you can rely on a community member
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.360]   a neighbor, an in-law, a partner,
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.640]   yes, that's a privilege,
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.760]   but they're not gonna know how to help you
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760]   unless you ask for it.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.000]   - Community seems really important.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.760]   It seems like all of this comes back to mental strength,
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.480]   whether it's the strength to go
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.920]   or the strength to keep going.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.480]   Can you share some tactics you use
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.120]   to help build that mental toughness
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.880]   that I know you're well-known for?
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.180]   - (laughs) I journal about this a lot.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.760]   One of the reasons I wrote "Welcome, Hustler,"
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.840]   it's an empowerment journal
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.680]   filled with my mantras and prompts and questions,
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.000]   but my own journaling practice
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.640]   really informed "Welcome, Hustler."
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.600]   And I celebrate tiny victories.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.540]   It's a visualization practice that I developed
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.940]   when I was running a lot of marathons and ultramarathons.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.960]   It's creating your own mental movie.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.400]   It's like you are the star of the highlight reel.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.100]   And it's, what, three, four moments
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.220]   that fill you with pride and confidence.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.720]   And you can run through it
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.980]   as if you were watching a preview at a movie theater.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.780]   And that visualization practice,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.920]   I really started more for race day,
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.880]   but I think it can take almost any context.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.720]   It can take a business context, a relationship context,
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.560]   as long as you're priming yourself
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.920]   with a positive visual and mental and emotional trigger.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.200]   So that mental movie reel, I think, is really important.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.920]   And then from a journaling perspective,
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.840]   it's celebrating the small victories.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.400]   It's remembering, especially for ambitious folks,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.160]   we're often onto the next thing
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.720]   before we've even had an opportunity
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.600]   to appreciate what got us there.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.960]   A gratitude reflection prompt that helps me
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.840]   is what is something that you have right now
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.280]   that you used to wish for, like you used to dream about?
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.560]   And oftentimes, I am humbled by what I wrote to write down
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.400]   'cause I'm like, oh my gosh,
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.880]   that thing that I'm writing down
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.360]   is something that annoyed me just this morning.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.560]   We just lose perspective really, really easily.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.480]   But the mental toughness piece, a lot of it, for me,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.160]   comes through my movement practice as well.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.440]   When I'm lifting weights, when I'm running distances,
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.840]   when I'm doing that stuff, you can't tell me anything.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.120]   When I think about my personal moments of pride
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.720]   in lifting weights and in running,
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.520]   that's something that nobody can take away from you,
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.320]   and that informs confidence.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.800]   And it's that discomfort, it's that stickiness
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.560]   that I'm like, ooh, I've been here before.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.720]   Like, emotionally and mentally, I've been here before.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.480]   I have a toolkit that I know that I can keep going to,
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.800]   especially as a parent, especially to the parents out there.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   I have the breathwork.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.440]   I'm gonna make the next best choice
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.640]   as it relates to my food
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.600]   because I wanna be fueled for greatness.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.840]   It's the movement practice,
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.600]   even if it looks different than it did pre-kids, pre-baby.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.560]   Those are the things that I often rely on,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.040]   and they give me mental acuity and bravery.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.880]   - What would you tell someone
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.120]   if you were in their ears right now,
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.120]   and they're trying to pick up time?
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.520]   So now I'm gonna try to go for a little further,
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.560]   go a little faster.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.400]   You could just stop.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.000]   No one's holding a gun to your head
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.200]   while you're going on a run saying, keep going.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.040]   What's going on?
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.000]   Are you playing that trailer back in your head,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.120]   or what are you doing to push yourself to keep going
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.080]   when things are hard?
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.440]   Or even to get started, to go out the door.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.400]   - I mean, to go out the door, it's just start.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.920]   It's meet yourself where you are,
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.720]   especially for folks who have stopped and are restarting.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   I think that's sometimes the toughest
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.120]   'cause then you're comparing yourself to your former self,
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.960]   and that's tough.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.120]   The beauty of it is you know you can get back
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.880]   to some element of that,
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.600]   even if it's not your quote-unquote glory days.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.400]   But I call it like dreamscaping.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.680]   I do this often in a journal.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.760]   It's like, who do I wanna be?
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.280]   What experiences do I wanna have?
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.680]   How do I wanna feel when I get there?
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.360]   And I try to detail that as specifically as possible,
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.440]   naming it and claiming it.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.840]   But then, from that dream
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.040]   that can be as ethereal as you want,
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.160]   what are the actions?
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.360]   Literally write down the action words and make a plan.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.320]   A dream without a deadline is a fairy tale,
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.680]   and I'm not rocking with Cinderella.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.720]   That is not my homegirl.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.680]   And so, it's important for me
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.760]   to just take some semblance of action.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.460]   I think action is actually a huge, huge antidote to anxiety,
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.600]   and focus can take the charge out of fear.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.240]   And it doesn't need to be in grand, sweeping strokes.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.720]   It can be super small.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.320]   Most of the inflection points that we have in our lives
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.480]   are totally boring.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.720]   They're subtle, little inflection points,
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.480]   and we are those thousands of small decisions.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.360]   - And are you tracking those decisions
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.120]   to feel like you're making progress
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.680]   when most people might just completely brush over them?
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.920]   - I mean, to a certain extent.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.120]   I'm not super mired in every tech watch
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.480]   and every data point.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.040]   What gets measured does get managed, right?
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.200]   So, I do think that numbers matter,
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.320]   but I think that there's a tipping point
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.960]   where you're so in that and so in the metrics
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.000]   that it can actually do more harm than good.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.560]   So, you have to decide your own relationship with that
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.200]   and see, is it helping or not?
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.160]   - Are you setting big, ambitious goals for yourself in life?
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.640]   Is that part of this practice?
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   - Yes.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.120]   I always have goals down the pipeline.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.440]   Sure, I sure do.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.400]   I'm a very goal-oriented person.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.720]   - How are you tracking them?
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.760]   How many are you having?
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.800]   I'm curious because I know you've written a lot
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.960]   about kind of designing an ideal life.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.720]   And it's like, how ambitious are you in that design?
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.560]   I've heard some people talk about,
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.840]   you should be designing this 10X version
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.560]   and forget about everything in between.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.200]   And some people design where they wanna be next month first.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.040]   - I think it's both.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.480]   And I do a kind of a big,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.320]   I would say around four times a year,
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.720]   I do vision boards and very much like business planning.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.360]   I had a strategy sync with my team recently.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.480]   What can we do right now?
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.320]   What can we accomplish within the year?
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.560]   What's the 10-year goal?
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.080]   So, I think you dream big and as far out
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.520]   as feels appropriate, but you better start with today
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.120]   'cause that's what matters.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.280]   And then do it again and then move the needle
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.800]   and get uncomfortable and do it again.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.560]   And we're literally doing that forever.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.760]   I am playing the infinite game,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.800]   but having finished lines of my own making
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.280]   are very motivating to me.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.040]   - How do you make sure that you're enjoying the journey?
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.120]   Because sometimes these goals are really far out.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.600]   - Ooh, I'm not a patient person,
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.840]   but I've been doing this long enough to know
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.080]   that progress is often invisible.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.160]   So, I just made the choice to fall in love
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.760]   with who I was becoming along the way
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.480]   and have little points of enchantment.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.160]   You know, play little games with myself.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.440]   (laughs)
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.480]   My husband laughs at me,
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.920]   but I'll be walking down the street and I'm like,
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.040]   all right, I know how long it takes to get to Sixth Avenue.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.240]   I'm gonna see if I can do it like two seconds faster today.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.800]   And I just play these games with myself
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.120]   and it matters to no one.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.200]   Literally nobody in the world is gonna know it but me.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.280]   That's just the kind of stuff
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.080]   that keeps me enchanted with the game.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.560]   And having run 27 marathons,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.320]   the finish line doesn't matter.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.360]   I wanna meet the finish line.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.720]   I respect the finish line,
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.960]   but the training has always been so much more important.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.200]   - And I think about the way you talk about what you do now
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   and it feels very authentic to who you are.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.440]   Like I can see it in our conversation.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.360]   And I'm guessing if you reflect on decades past
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.280]   that wasn't you,
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.920]   what do you think was helpful for you to find
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.640]   that version of yourself now that might've been,
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.400]   I don't even know if it was imaginable back then.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.520]   (laughs)
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.560]   - Well, I have to say, yeah,
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.560]   when I was wearing like ill-fitting Ann Taylor suits
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.880]   at my law firm in the 2000s.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.360]   (laughs)
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.280]   Oh, honey, I don't know where the swagger was,
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.000]   but she had to work hard to find it.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   I started to befriend myself on the runs, frankly.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   I was working 80 hours a week as a corporate litigator.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I would steal little pockets of time to run
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.240]   and start to lift weights
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.120]   and started to cycle and things like that.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   And I really liked who I was when I was doing those things,
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.480]   even when I was uncomfortable.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.400]   And I started to become very acutely aware
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.200]   of the conversation in between my ears
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.120]   when I started ultra training, especially.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.680]   You're really aware of those thoughts get loud.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.160]   And instead of trying to push the thoughts away,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   I got curious.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.880]   We all have the little whispers of a goal,
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.760]   of something that we wanna pursue,
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.520]   maybe something that we shouldn't be doing.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.120]   We know deeply, but there's a lot of noise.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.200]   And for me, the ultra training
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.080]   helped tune out some of that noise.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.440]   And I started to turn the whispers into roars
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.240]   by consistently training,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.160]   putting myself in uncomfortable situations,
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.760]   starting to trust myself more.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.920]   And I think it was born from that.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.320]   - And do you think the same could be true
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.920]   for someone while they're painting
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.360]   or some other kind of hobby or interest
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.000]   that could one day be their career?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   - I think one of the most important pursuits as adults
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.600]   that children do innately are pay attention
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.880]   to moments of flow.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.480]   You know, there's a lot of research in books
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.080]   about flow state and all that.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.320]   And the flow state for me, how I can best describe it,
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.280]   is losing track of time
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.840]   when you really feel in alignment with your skillset.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.240]   And it's not the doom scrolling loose track of time.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.720]   And it doesn't have to be a creative pursuit, right?
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.960]   Like you could break code, you could be in spreadsheets
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.680]   and you're just like, this is my jam.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.520]   And it's not necessarily gonna feel great.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.280]   I think we misunderstand
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.880]   that passion often feels like frustration.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.840]   There are many points in my day
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.680]   that I am completely frustrated
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.960]   'cause things aren't moving fast enough
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.240]   or I'm not working hard enough.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.800]   It's still an alignment with my skillset and my values
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.440]   and the rocket ship that I'm trying to build.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.320]   - I mean, it's probably 'cause you care so much.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.680]   - And it is because I care so much.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.200]   And I wanna live a life engulfed in those flames.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.760]   And the important thing for me is,
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.880]   especially when I left law,
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.520]   I made a commitment that I loved being in flow state
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.000]   so much, that would be my goal.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.360]   I remember one, I had a two-year goal of like,
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.240]   what projects, commitments, experiences,
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.480]   partnerships are gonna maximize flow.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   And I got home from a long day at the office.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.400]   It's like 11 p.m.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.160]   I opened up the notes app on my phone
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.040]   and I wrote down the exact.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.280]   And when I say the exact,
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.440]   the exact job I have now at Peloton.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.640]   And this is before I had never met anyone
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   related to the company.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.200]   So getting specific, becoming more self-aware,
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.680]   telling anyone who will listen what that dream is
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.080]   and getting better at what you're already good at
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.400]   are all important things.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.080]   - It's funny, as you were talking about that flow state,
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.920]   it made me think, for people trying to figure out
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.480]   what that thing could be for them,
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.760]   it's like, what's a thing that gets in the way
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.560]   of you doing something you want to do?
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.360]   And I say this because there are times
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   where my wife and I are like,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.800]   oh, I'm gonna cook dinner tonight.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.640]   And then I show up like 20 minutes late.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.520]   And I'm like, I genuinely planned on cooking dinner.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.400]   It wasn't that I didn't think dinner was important.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.920]   It's that I just got into this state
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.800]   where I more or less just lost track of time,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.920]   but not because I didn't care about the commitment.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.680]   Obviously, there are times where we don't do things
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.560]   'cause we just don't care.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   It's like, what's that thing
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.960]   that can get you to do something,
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.040]   to break your own commitment to yourself?
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.880]   And I would say spend time on that.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.040]   Time thinking about it, journaling, writing,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.720]   just try to figure out what it is
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.960]   and then just relieve yourself from the expectation
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.040]   that it will be your full-time job tomorrow.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.240]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.600]   Just start doing it.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.640]   - And is journaling a big part of all of this for you?
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.720]   - Yeah, my journaling practice has changed over the years.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.320]   Since having kids, it used to be part of my morning routine.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.160]   Now it's kind of getting back to my morning routine.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.600]   Not that my son sleeps through the night,
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.440]   but I released myself from this.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.560]   I defined what consistency meant to me
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.800]   as it related to journaling.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.320]   And I think that's another important point.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.800]   We don't all have to have a scribe
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   and it's Ben Franklin's morning pages,
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.480]   you know, for hours by candlelight.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.320]   You decide.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.720]   And so journaling in the past year
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.000]   has been two to three minutes.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.160]   I'll often use one of the prompts from my own journal
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.760]   and that it's just planting seeds, planting seeds,
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.280]   planting seeds, see what comes up.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.000]   It might not be fruitful for a long time.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.920]   Your season of harvest might not be coming yet.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.600]   You might be right now just planting the seeds,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.360]   planting the seeds, but just keep planting.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.680]   - And what kind of big goals do you have coming forward?
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.640]   - Well, definitely as it relates to the food space,
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.240]   to cooking, to lifestyle products
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.200]   and projects and publications.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.120]   I'm excited to get that out into the world.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.640]   I love fashion.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.000]   So that's something that I wanna continue exploring,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.840]   you know, licensing deals with partners
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.240]   that I'm really proud to work with.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.320]   And of course, continuing at Peloton
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.840]   and all the great work we do there.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.560]   - That's a lot of things to be excited about,
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.440]   to be working on.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.360]   How do you balance all of that excitement and passion
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.200]   and flow states with your other passion of your family?
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.320]   How do you think about that as an ambitious person?
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.200]   - I mean, I'm still figuring it out, right?
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.440]   For me, it is crucial to only say yes
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.120]   to things that feel like a hell yes.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.240]   If I even get that smidge of like,
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.200]   I'm not sure I wanna do this.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.080]   It's a no, it is an immediate no.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.040]   And I don't mean like, go to the dentist.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.560]   I don't mean like the stuff, like, you know, pay taxes.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.840]   Like not the stuff you have to do.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.040]   I mean, a lot of it comes in the form
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.480]   of the social commitments, the agreeing to bring the thing.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.400]   No, no, thank you.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.720]   I'm not available, period.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.360]   - And is that the guiding principle
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.840]   of the way you structure your days?
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.120]   - I say no to most things, yes.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.920]   I own my no to protect my yes.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.920]   I communicate very clearly what it is that I want and need.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.280]   I have now a great team, right?
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.160]   So it's not just me.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.280]   It's not just me on the home front.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.560]   It's not just me on the business front.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.960]   I'm not trying to do everything.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.040]   I shouldn't do everything.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.720]   And I don't pretend like I do.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.640]   I know what I'm good at.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.840]   I'm willing to say I don't know.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.120]   I'm willing to change my mind.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.600]   I think that takes an immense confidence.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.400]   I think the most confident leaders are those
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.200]   who are willing to say, I don't know.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.560]   And listen, those are, you know,
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.360]   aspects of my day-to-day life
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.960]   that make everything possible.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.920]   And I'm sure I'm gonna make missteps.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.880]   I probably already have recently.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.480]   And I'll just keep learning.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.320]   - When it comes to learning,
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.840]   how important are mentorship, reading,
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.280]   other forms of learning for you?
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.360]   Where do you spend your time growing?
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.240]   - Oh, well, you know, I think it's so cool
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.160]   that we can really be mentored by folks
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.640]   who we've never met now, right?
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.280]   So in creating my masterclass on mental toughness,
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.720]   that was a way to create that educational hub
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.320]   and allow folks to spend time with me,
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.560]   you know, in a way that scales.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.960]   And similarly, I'm spending time
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.200]   with some of the greatest minds in the world,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.400]   whether it's through their podcasts,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.600]   like this one or Rich Roll or Human Lab
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.000]   or whoever, you know, these folks who I'm just like,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.800]   wow, I get to learn from you.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.480]   And for me, listening to information
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.920]   is a great way for me personally to take in information.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.520]   And I probably, on my walks,
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.240]   I'm almost always listening to something,
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.640]   to enrich growth mindset, entrepreneurship, parenting,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.880]   like stuff that I want to move the needle a little bit
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.520]   and learn from those greatest minds.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.800]   - Where can people that want to stay in touch with you
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.680]   and see all this stuff find you?
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.400]   - I am Raven Arzon.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.440]   My website is ravenarzon.com.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.600]   Check out three for 31, the number three, four, 31.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.080]   And that is the December challenge
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.200]   that we do this year and every year.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.160]   And of course you can see me at Peloton.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.000]   - Awesome.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.840]   I'll link all that in the show notes.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.400]   I will be there for the challenge this year.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   I hope everyone listening joins as well.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.640]   - Amazing. Thank you.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.840]   - Thanks for being here.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.640]   Wow, that was a fantastic conversation.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.880]   I feel extra motivated to get out right now,
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.960]   which is probably good because I am serious
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.680]   about that three for 31 challenge.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.160]   I welcome you all to join me
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.160]   and try to get yourself moving every single day of December.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.280]   Also, if you celebrated Thanksgiving last week,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.960]   I hope you had a wonderful time.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.080]   It gave me a moment to be so thankful
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.880]   for everything in life right now.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.440]   I really appreciate all of you
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.560]   and helping make this my dream job.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.480]   I'm so often in that flow state Robin talked about
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.160]   when I'm working on all the hacks.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.240]   So I am so incredibly fortunate.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.440]   That's it for this week.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.640]   I will see you next week.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.980]   you
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:32.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
