[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Well, Friday we talked about the difference between unholy anger and holy anger, and you,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.220]   Pastor John, talked about anger as a marriage killer.
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.900]   Today we look more closely at anger and its destructive force inside of the home.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.740]   An anonymous woman who listens to the podcast has written us a really sharp question, Pastor
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.740]   John, here it is.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.400]   Pastor John, thank you for the years you have faithfully invested in this podcast.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.480]   Over those years, I don't believe you have ever spoken on emotional and verbal abuse
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.320]   inside of the home.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.640]   At what point do emotional outbursts from an adult in a home call for church discipline
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.080]   or for the involvement of the local church leadership?
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.600]   I'm talking about verbal put-downs aimed at children, cuss words, and raised voices used
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.800]   in anger to force an opinion on the home in a consistent pattern.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.320]   I want to keep this in the general level because I want you to offer general categories for
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.520]   me and other listeners to use.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:11.200]   It's pretty obvious, amazingly, that this woman has really carefully crafted the description
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.120]   of the behavior she's asking about.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.280]   In other words, she asked me to provide the categories to think about this, but she, I
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.760]   think, has done a remarkable job—and I'm sure it did not come quickly—a remarkably
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.400]   good job providing them already herself.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.460]   Now let me reread her key sentence, and you'll see exactly what I mean.
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.880]   And then I want to give some Scriptures that throw what she says into such serious relief,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.360]   and then close with a few other aspects that she may or may not be thinking about, but
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.120]   I think are also important.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.000]   So here's the sentence which describes the kind of behavior she's asking about.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.480]   Quote, "I'm talking about verbal put-downs," and I'm going to make a comment after each
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   key phrase because she has chosen her words very carefully, and I'm going to tell you
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.640]   what I think is meant, what I would mean by them, and I think she means by them.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.320]   "I'm talking about verbal put-downs," which is the opposite, I'm saying, of language that
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.760]   builds up and offers grace.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.720]   She continues, "Aimed at children," and I add, "Aimed at anyone would be a problem, but
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.320]   this introduces the added long-term damage as well as the cruel use of power," she continues,
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.800]   "and cuss words," I add, "which introduces the dimension of ugly and dirty intensity,"
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:06.960]   she continues, "and raised voices used in anger," I add, "which names the emotion and
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   heightens the sense of fearfulness and attack," she adds, "to force," I add, "which identifies
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.240]   a sense of coercion rather than appeal or persuasion," she continues, "and opinion on
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.760]   the home," I interpret, "which suggests it's not just shared convictions that are at stake
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.840]   here, but opinions that don't necessarily have any moral weight and are still being
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.000]   with such high-level intensity of anger forced," and then she finishes with, "in a consistent
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.720]   pattern," which points out that this is not an occasional outburst, but an ongoing and
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.000]   unrepented pattern.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.320]   Now that's a pretty carefully crafted definition of a pattern of behavior called verbal abuse
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:11.920]   or emotional abuse, and I, for one, really appreciate that kind of verbal care.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.160]   She clearly does not want this to be treated or dismissed as an ordinary run-of-the-mill
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.680]   or minor conflict, as might mar a good marriage now and then, and I don't dismiss it that
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.600]   way or treat it that way, and the reason is the text that follows.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.840]   So let me just read some passages of Scripture, and every one of them could be correlated
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.360]   with the particular points that she was making about the spouse's behavior, who is speaking
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120]   that way and acting that way.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:55.520]   Colossians 3, 8, "Now you must put away all anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.240]   talk from your mouth."
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.180]   Ephesians 4, 31, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.920]   from you, with all malice, and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.640]   another, as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   Colossians 3, 19, "Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them."
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:31.840]   First Peter 3, 8, "All of you have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, tender
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.080]   heart, humble mind.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.320]   Don't repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.120]   to this you were called that you may obtain a blessing."
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.080]   Ephesians 5, 25, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.080]   for her."
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.120]   Husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:03.000]   He who loves his wife loves himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.160]   and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church because we're members of his body.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.400]   Ephesians 4, 29, "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouth, but only what is good
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:24.920]   for up-building, building up as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear."
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.860]   And finally, Philippians 1, 8, "Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:40.440]   you to do what is required, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you."
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.560]   I, Paul, an old man, now a prisoner.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.280]   And we could, of course, go on.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:56.720]   These passages make every phrase of her sentence that we looked at, make it warranted as a
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:05.460]   serious spiritual moral issue, whether from a husband or from a wife.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.500]   So my short answer is this.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:16.320]   The behavior as she defined it, and as I tried to interpret it and illuminate it, is enough
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:23.960]   to warrant a spouse turning to the elders of the church for help, possibly for discipline,
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.240]   depending on the spouse's response, and possibly then for excommunication.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.120]   That's a pretty serious statement about that sentence.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.000]   But here's what I want to add.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.600]   I think it might be helpful to point out, and I'm sure she knows this, but all of our
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.880]   listeners not think in these categories, and it's pretty radical what I'm going to say.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.920]   There should be, in every Christian marriage, a web of relationships in the church, in the
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.040]   community, among friends.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.720]   However, among Christians it can happen.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.800]   There should be a web of relationships, and I know there are not a lot of healthy communities
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.640]   and aren't as many healthy churches as we would like.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.040]   I get that.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.920]   I'm talking about what ought to be and what a young couple should pursue.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:24.160]   There should be a web of relationships which should exert correcting and rebuking and healing
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.360]   influence before there is the need for official involvement of the elders.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:40.280]   The New Testament is shot through with commands to ordinary laypeople to exhort us to exhort
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:46.920]   each other and rebuke each other and correct each other and pray for each other regularly.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:54.440]   It's amazing how many marriages painfully limp along with nobody able to do that.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.840]   That's tragic.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.600]   And I would say to every young couple, and I know it's too late for many couples who
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   are so far gone in the dysfunctional relationship, they won't ever do this without a miracle,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:16.880]   but I would say to every young couple from the beginning, enmesh yourselves in a web
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.960]   of relationships, a small group, a set of friends who are close enough to you that they
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.800]   can know when problems are happening in your marriage.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:37.560]   And I would even say that a husband and wife should get permission from the other to have
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:46.920]   one or two people that they are willing to have the spouse share absolutely everything
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.880]   with in the marriage that's going on.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.400]   Not that they always would share everything, but that the trust level is high enough that
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.200]   they are allowed at their own judgment to make that call.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.400]   For example, I, years ago, we were having enough trouble.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   We did this.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:16.080]   I gave Noelle the permission to say to one or two other women absolutely anything about
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.200]   our marriage without betraying me.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.640]   I said, "It will not be a betrayal.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:27.080]   I give you permission to say absolutely anything to her, and I trust you not to do so in a
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.280]   way that would be destructive."
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.120]   And she did the same for me.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.080]   Noelle has given me permission to say to one or two other men absolutely anything about
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.360]   what's going on in our home, and she trusts me not to say things that would be destructive
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.480]   or damaging.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:51.560]   And I realize this requires an enormous amount of trust, both between the spouses and with
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:57.840]   the friends, and I would say ultimately in God, and a great deal of courage for friends,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.860]   the friends, to then turn around and confront the husband or the wife.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.680]   But that's the kind of web of relationships I'm talking about.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:17.560]   Then, if all of that involvement of other friends does not bring about the repentance
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.000]   for the kind of behavior we're talking about here, then the involvement of the elders will
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.260]   not at all seem precipitous, but all things will be established in the mouth of two or
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.560]   three witnesses.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   Very sobering.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.480]   And as Pastor John said earlier, a question like this takes a lot of time to articulate,
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.780]   and these are the questions we're looking for.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.180]   Really think hard about the core of what it is you're asking about.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.620]   And thanks for listening and making this podcast part of your day and commute.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.500]   It's an honor to join you as part of your day, even as we address some pretty sobering
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.020]   questions like this one.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.900]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds, search our past episodes, even reach us by email
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:06.660]   with a question of your own through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.620]   Well in scripture we see that God wants our hearts enlightened so that we may know what
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.160]   is the hope to which he has called you.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.740]   What are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints?
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.580]   But what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints that we read about in Ephesians
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.580]   118?
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.260]   I will ask John Piper that question on Friday when we return.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.740]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.740]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:30.740]   We'll see you next time.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.800]   we'll see you next time.
