[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The primary pitch is that we are more or less the foremost organization in the world that is a
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.880]   non-profit group doing research on and training and publicly releasing large language models.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.120]   If you look at the list of organizations that have trained large language models that are
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.840]   kind of at the scale that we operate at or larger, it is overwhelmingly dominated by
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.800]   major tech companies as well as a handful of other for-profit organizations. Then there are a couple
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.280]   universities in China that have very close relationships with the Chinese government and
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.280]   have access to Chinese government supercomputers. And then there is the
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.400]   Big Science Research Workshop, which was an international collaboration but had a very
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   specific grant and a very specific time frame and is now over. Then there's us. That is the
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.560]   list of people who train in large language models. And so for people who want to support
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.920]   research and people who want to support non-profits doing research, it's
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   we are the people that they would go support is really a large part of it.
