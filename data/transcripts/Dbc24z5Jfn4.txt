[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.640]   I'm on my final episode of taking over for the normal host of the show, Rick Ferry, while
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:37.340]   he takes a summer sabbatical.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.440]   Today our special guest is Steven Chen.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.040]   Steve is founder and CEO of New Retirement, a do-it-yourself tool for retirement planning.

[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.080]   Steve Chen, welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.640]   John, great to be here.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.080]   Appreciate the opportunity to be on your show.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.240]   And I'm looking forward to seeing you again at the Bogleheads conference this year.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.840]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.360]   Last year was the first time I went.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.280]   It was great to be there, meet a lot of folks that we've had on the podcast and just met
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   in the community.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.720]   And also, it was the first time I'd ever in person met a bunch of our users at one time.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.200]   So it was great to get their feedback and hear what they thought about the platform.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.100]   Steve Chen, tell us about yourself.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.480]   My career has been in two big areas.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.020]   One is financial services, building software for larger companies like Charles Schwab and
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.680]   Wells Fargo and things like that.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   That's how I started as a consultant.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.560]   Then I built a really early SaaS company that helped high school students basically do college
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.080]   research and apply online and so forth.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.160]   And then was back in consulting and saw this problem in my own family with my mom, like
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160]   how do you get ready for retirement?
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.760]   How do you make the transition to retirement?
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.600]   And she came to us with this challenge, which is like, I need financial help and guidance.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.760]   We tried to outsource the problem by finding a financial advisor that would help her.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   But pretty much everybody we talked to, their business model was based on asset center management
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.600]   and she didn't have a lot of assets, so she couldn't get the help.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.240]   So we ended up doing it ourselves on a spreadsheet.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.860]   And so we basically did this and then said, "Hey, there's 120 million people in this country
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.860]   over age 50.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.120]   They have 80% of the money, but everybody's still worried about retirement.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.760]   So it looks like there's a problem that's unaddressed."
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.920]   And started building this as a project and then it's become a much larger company since
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   then.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.000]   Basically have built like a TurboTax for planning.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.200]   So anyone can build their own financial plan for free.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.840]   Or you can pay us like TurboTax, 120 bucks a year and use the software.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.560]   Or if you want to talk to like a coach or a CFP on a flat fee and kind of hourly basis,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.560]   you can do that.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   And that's where it stops.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   We don't manage money.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.400]   All we do is help people think about their plan and frame up their choices so that they
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.060]   can understand where they are, understand what their options are.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.360]   See different scenarios for, "If I work longer, if I downsize, if I invest differently, what
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   does that mean?"
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   But yeah, that's the journey so far.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.560]   And we appreciate the opportunity to be in front of the bold heads community and also
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.640]   learn because there's so much information and knowledge in this community.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.080]   It's really like one of the big unlocks would be how do you get all that knowledge out to
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.640]   the mass market?
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.560]   We started attracting users that had their own spreadsheets and work into it, like planning
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   enthusiasts.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.840]   And so that informed the evolution of our product.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.600]   So it got steadily more powerful, right?
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.560]   They're like, "Oh, well, we wanted to do a Monte Carlo.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   Oh, we wanted to do scenarios.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   Oh, we wanted to do tax modeling.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   We wanted to know if I buy an annuity, how does that affect my plan?
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.000]   Social security earlier versus later.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.360]   If you move from a state where there's state income taxes to where there's not state income
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.000]   taxes, like Florida, we need to help people frame all this stuff up in a completely unbiased
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   way.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.600]   There's a lot of providers that will give you planning, but then they're selling something
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.200]   like roll over to my 401k or buy my annuity or whatever it is, right?
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.000]   So we didn't do any of that stuff.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.560]   Something's free, then you're the product.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.920]   And I think that's one of the fundamental things that we arrived at.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.720]   We addressed that by saying, all right, we're going to charge consumers.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.080]   Now it's a much longer, slower road that we're taking.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   That's where we want to start.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.040]   Charge consumers, be transparent about it, low fee, easy to understand, not overly complicated.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.600]   That's what we're about.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.040]   Let's jump to some questions from the BogleEdge community.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.840]   This question is from Lindsey Young from Twitter, who asks, "I'd love to know Steve's
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.760]   thoughts on whether do-it-yourselfers really understand risk enough to be able to make
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.160]   their own retirement plans that incorporate not just investing, but tax planning, insurance,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.480]   and estate planning too."
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.360]   We want to take people as far as they want to go.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.660]   It's much simpler and less scary to just sit down at your laptop and punch some numbers
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.480]   into a calculator and see what it says and start learning about yourself and your own
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.880]   financial situation, but also starting to see what some of these interrelated mechanics
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.000]   are and how these things hang together.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   For many of our users, they get so far down the path and they're like, wow, good news
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.720]   is I'm framing up my situation and I have opportunities.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.480]   But the bad news is some of the stuff gets pretty complicated and some of these numbers
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   start to look big.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.320]   Social security optimization is out there.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.080]   There's how should I fund long-term care, how do I fund longevity and all that stuff.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.840]   And the way we have approached this is to say, okay, look, there's software and then
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.560]   hey, if you want to just drop into office hours, you can do that.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.680]   Or if you want to take a class, you can do that.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.120]   We're bundling classes with the software now.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.600]   Some classes are free.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.720]   There's a community on Facebook and they learn together because that's the most trustworthy
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   source, right?
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   It's not even us.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.080]   It's your peers that are going through the same stuff.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.360]   The industry historically is one-to-one, right?
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.860]   Like I need help and I'm going to talk to a single advisor and that doesn't scale basically.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.040]   Given the amount of people that need help, you need to be teaching people in mass and
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   using technology to learn about them and help them learn about themselves.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.920]   And to learn more about do-it-yourself retirement planning, check out our interview with Derek
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   Tharp.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.520]   I'll link to that in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.360]   That was part of our Bogleheads live series.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.520]   This question is from Rick Ferry, the normal host of this show.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.920]   And he writes, "I'd be interested in hearing Steve's thoughts about a robo AI advisor replacing
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.840]   human advisors for routine personal finance."
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.280]   I think this is a matter of when, not if.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.600]   This is definitely going to happen.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.520]   We're already starting to see AI co-pilots for things like writing code and they're getting
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.160]   better and better.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.280]   But every position where you're delivering advice, and it's not just financial advice,
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.560]   because it could be doctors and lawyers, where you're processing a huge amount of information,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.000]   I think you will end up having AI helping you.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.040]   We'd use it today.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.600]   We use our phones all the time.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.480]   Maps are telling us how to go, and then they're dynamically solving for traffic.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.280]   That's a lot of the way I see what we're doing, is that you're trying to go somewhere, get
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.580]   wealthier, take care of your family, right?
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.480]   But along the way, there's all kinds of things changing around you.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.520]   The markets are moving, tax rates are changing, regulation is changing.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.160]   So how do you adapt to that and make more optimal choices?
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.400]   I think that's where technology can really be helpful for individuals and experts that
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.520]   are helping those individuals.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.320]   This is actually happening now with advisors, where we're also providing our platform to
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   advisors.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.080]   And some executives are like, "What happens if this platform starts getting smarter than
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   some of the advisors?"
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.520]   Look, there's incredible advisors out there.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.240]   We're not outsmarting advisors, but there's different kinds of advisors.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.120]   So, you know, we might be coming up with ideas that it's not their specialty.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.240]   I think a lot of the software is smarter than some of the advisors today, but that's a whole
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.360]   other conversation.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.240]   Fender Strat Guy from Bogleheads Reddits writes that Bogle, Markowitz, Fama, Sharp, for example,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.440]   they each have their own take on what a perfect retirement portfolio should be.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.040]   I'd be interested in hearing what Steve Chen recommends.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.840]   And speaking of Bogle and Sharp, they were both previous guests on the Bogleheads On
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.000]   Investing podcast, Jack Bogle on episode one, and recently we interviewed William Sharp.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.520]   I'll link to those episodes on the show notes for our listeners to check out.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.040]   I am far from perfect like many people.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.960]   I have my own biases that influence my behavior.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   And I was a DIY person.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.800]   If I had been using an advisor earlier, I might have made better choices.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.320]   But after doing my own podcast and talking to lots of experts like yourself, where I
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.640]   am today is I am largely equity heavy.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.600]   It's things like index funds.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.200]   So BTSAX, buying of the overall market, generally have long-term perspective.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.680]   When I was younger, I worked at Schwab as a consultant right out of school.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.480]   And so I was like, "Oh, I got a brokerage account."
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.920]   And then I learned, "Oh, I can trade options."
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.040]   I started doing stuff like that.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.320]   I traded Forex at one point, you know, gambling.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   That's like crazy stuff.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.420]   And you know, I'd be paying attention to the market and all this stuff.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.700]   Now, I don't even think about it.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.100]   Like, I don't even watch it.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:45.620]   I have belief in the U.S. and world economy and that capitalism is a good allocator of
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.260]   resources and generally you get more productive over time.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.440]   And that those returns will accrue to the investor.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.220]   And the most efficient way is to get your money in the market and pay low fees, but
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.740]   very much have to set it and forget it.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.340]   And I don't really need this money for 20 plus years.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.900]   And consequently, I'm now doing way better.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:10.500]   I have some alternative investments because really probably for social reasons, as a founder,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.340]   I've done some angel investing, which is super risky and not recommended, but it's not a
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.340]   lot of money.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.540]   I also have done some real estate stuff, also debatable.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.340]   A lot of people spend a lot of time thinking about their portfolio and trying to get it
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.340]   just right.
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.980]   I think I'm more of a get in the market, keep the fees low and you'll be fine.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.160]   It's better to just try to solve for the most efficient risk-adjusted rate of return.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.220]   And the best way to do that is to get wide market exposure, keep your fees low and not
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.920]   move your money around very much.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.240]   And then you should be mostly fine.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.660]   And this is the advantage older people have is they've seen it before.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.840]   When you're younger and you live through like a crypto collapse or something, or the dot
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.400]   com bubble, it shocks the system and it can change your behavior.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.720]   When you're older and you've seen the market tank and recover, I think you get a lot more,
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.640]   okay, I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.520]   The market can go down 30% and you're like, whatever, I think it'll be fine.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.280]   Username Bureaucracy Now from Bogleheads Reddit writes, "I'd be interested in hearing if
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.080]   Steve thinks there are specific thresholds.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.360]   I wish it makes sense to check in with a financial advisor."
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.120]   And we had a similar question from Jerry L. from the Bogleheads forums about how often
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.840]   you should get an evaluation done on your retirement plan.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.640]   People should think about this, even at the very beginning, whether it's an individual
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.920]   advisor or a community.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.640]   It's worth getting educated and more importantly, getting started.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.480]   So I think a lot of people learn what to do and they don't necessarily take action.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.520]   I think that's one of the biggest things that an advisor does for you.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.680]   They can be our accountability coach and be like, okay, we are going to look into the
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.440]   company match and look into your company plan and say, okay, start saving, take advantage
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   of the match.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.920]   Make sure your portfolio is set up effectively, especially if you're young, mostly equities
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.820]   and hopefully low fee funds, and at least get going on the right path.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.580]   As you go through your life, at those points where you have big decisions, you're having
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:08.020]   a family, buying a house, your kids are going to college, you're thinking about retirement,
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.680]   you're thinking about your parents and taking care of them.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.240]   You're thinking about your own long-term care needs and longevity.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.580]   It's definitely worth it to check in with folks.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.700]   And it doesn't have to be, you know, full service, AUM based advisor, it can be a flat
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.420]   fee kind of situation.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.460]   If you don't have a lot of money and you're paying a thousand bucks to talk to someone,
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.900]   that's a relatively large amount of money.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.780]   But if you start to have more money, then it becomes negligible because if you can avoid
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.500]   making some big mistakes, that's a big thing.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.220]   I think the other big thing is set up like a safety valve for yourself.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:46.460]   The whole move from pensions to defined contribution 401k plans, basically set it up so that every
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.300]   individual had to become like their own CFO and learn about this stuff, which is kind
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   of a crazy idea.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.740]   If you made good choices and you save a million dollars, great.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:03.780]   You can still screw yourself, excuse the language, by making mistakes later where you start taking
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.680]   too much risk when you don't need to, because you're bored.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.740]   Some people they're bored and they're like, I need to start messing around with my money,
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.740]   even though it's doing fine, you know?
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.980]   And then you're like, I just started messing around with $2 million and now I have a million
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.980]   and a half dollars.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.980]   And you're like, wait a sec.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.980]   Then you're emotionally tied up.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.940]   I'm like, I got to make another half a million bucks back talking to another person who hopefully
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.220]   help you avoid making that mistake in the first place or rationally approach fixing
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.260]   it up can be really helpful.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.260]   So certainly taking the right amount of risk that is part of investing 101 and learn more
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.260]   about investing 101.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.340]   I will link to the Bogleheads investing philosophy on the show notes for our listeners to check
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.340]   out.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.880]   Wally Conway from Bogleheads Facebook writes, when will there be a military feature similar
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.460]   to the social security feature?
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.180]   So we do have veterans or active military in the community.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.980]   We try to do things like TRICARE for healthcare.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.700]   It's not specifically documented, but we have workarounds on the platform.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.500]   So you can opt out of like, I don't have Medicare, I have another means of paying for it.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.040]   And then you can manually enter your plan there.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.140]   I wouldn't say we reflect every benefit that you get from being in the military.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.500]   It is definitely something we think about.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.060]   We have so many ways to make this platform better, and we're working hard on it.
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   Send us your feedback.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.660]   If you're a user, log issues directly.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.180]   We use a chat interface.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.940]   You can message us directly or actually you can see features that have been logged by
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.180]   other people and vote them up and down.
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.940]   Or you can also log your own ideas for how to make the platform better.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:43.600]   This one is username Justin JHYN from Bogleheads Facebook who writes, what kind of expected
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:50.260]   return should one be using for 10, 20, and 30 year retirement planning for each asset
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.780]   class, US, international, small cap value, total bond market, et cetera?
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.060]   So we basically do it account by account.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:03.260]   So our users very often have multiple institutions that have money in Schwab and Fidelity and
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.860]   Vanguard or some mix, right?
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.860]   And other places.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.140]   And then they have different kinds of accounts, taxable and then qualified.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.220]   So tax deferred and then tax exempt Roth.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:21.860]   So we default rates of return using historical norms and the platform also has inflation
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.860]   built into it.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.020]   And you can basically set inflation for expenses, for housing, for social security, and for
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.100]   healthcare.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.620]   We inflate those things differently.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.620]   You can set those.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:37.780]   And then for returns, we default them to historical averages, four to 7%, and then people can
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.780]   change it.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.780]   They can take it up.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.180]   What we do is we imply a riskier portfolio for you.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.820]   So if you're like, oh, I think I'm going to do six to 9%, we're like, hey, this is a super
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.560]   equity heavy and therefore it has the same volatility characteristics of a portfolio
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.820]   like that.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.940]   And then we do that for every single account that you have.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.300]   And then we run Monte Carlo across all of it.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.340]   Justin's question gets to an important point when it comes to using financial planning
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.460]   software.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.100]   The investment returns that you assume for US stocks, international stocks, et cetera,
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.620]   is going to have a big impact on what that retirement planning software says about your
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.660]   particular retirement plan.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:22.180]   For example, we interviewed Christine Benz on episode four and episode 37 of the Bullhead's
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.380]   Live Show, where she used Monte Carlo software to answer the question, how much can I spend
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.500]   in retirement?
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.620]   And over the course of a year, her research made different assumptions about what future
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.460]   investment returns are going to be, and the result was you could spend a different amount
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.620]   because of that.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.320]   So the data that you put into your financial planning software matters because it's going
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.660]   to affect that output.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.820]   I think thinking about retirement spending is evolving.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.880]   Everyone has been focused on accumulation in financial services, like accumulate wealth
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.620]   and how much, nobody can answer.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.820]   It's just as much as possible because that's how the whole industry is paid.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.060]   Now with generational changes, people are like, okay, I'm going to draw down that wealth.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.540]   How am I going to decumulate money?
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.540]   Even in our software, we talk about chance of success, which is one way of framing it.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:15.020]   The reality is it's not that if you fail, everything blows up and you're destitute.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.200]   It's the percent chance of being able to maintain the level of spending that you're targeting.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.220]   So if you can't do that, then what happens?
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.820]   Well, the reality is maybe it only has to move five or 10% for a couple of years, and
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.180]   then you're back to being on track.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.260]   And I think that's a much better way of framing it.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.660]   If the market doesn't return well enough and you're nervous, you have to take your spending
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.660]   down a bit.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.900]   To your point, that Monte Carlo simulation, whether it's an 80% success rate, et cetera,
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.300]   doesn't mean in 20% of the time, you're going to have to be living under a bridge.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:47.940]   It means that there's a 20% chance you'll need to make a change to your spending plan.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.700]   One thing I've noticed in that percent figure, Stephen, I'd be curious about your thoughts
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.960]   on this, is that the lower that percent is not only going to be the likelihood you need
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.820]   to make a change, but also the degree of that change.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.060]   If you've only got a 50% success rate, you'll probably have to make a change, you'll probably
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.020]   have to be a big change.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.820]   Has that been your experience in playing with the Monte Carlo software modeling tools?
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.940]   Yeah, I think that's generally true.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.940]   The reality is for many people, they have a lot of levers they can pull.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.760]   How aggressive am I invested?
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.460]   How long should I work?
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.980]   Should I work part time?
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.040]   When do I claim social security?
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.460]   What we see is people are constructing these plans and thinking about all the things they
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.460]   have.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:36.420]   And for many folks that have had long careers, they also don't want to necessarily just hang
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.420]   it up completely.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.300]   I was listening to the Cody Garrett podcast you guys just rolled, and he talked about
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.700]   this, where people, they want to have something to retire to.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.740]   They miss the social engagement and the intellectual stimulation of work.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.280]   And so you retire, you're making 150,000 bucks a year, and then you start consulting and
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.180]   suddenly you're making $50,000 a year, and then you're claiming social security, and
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.820]   then you're thinking, maybe I shouldn't claim social security yet because I can defer that
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.380]   till 70, and maybe that's a better decision.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.700]   So people's situations change, and their human capital does remain important.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.860]   I think that is one thing about the whole FIRE community that people need to be aware
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:13.620]   of is you are taking risk by not continuing to save.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.020]   If you retire really young, you don't get to renew that human capital.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.500]   So just be pretty thoughtful about your scenario modeling.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.860]   Steven mentioned our previous episode with Cody Garrett.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.900]   I'll link to that in the show notes for our listeners.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.160]   Folks can check that out.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.680]   This question is from username TwoPetals from the Bogleheads forums, who writes, "What
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.980]   are the top three biggest risks for people in retirement, and how can they avoid or mitigate
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.980]   them?"
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.340]   I actually have four risks, so I'll list the risks and then some ideas.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.280]   So longevity, we don't know how long we're going to live.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.260]   People that we talked about before are really trying to hedge that risk out.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.780]   So inflation, we're definitely seeing that in the COVID era, especially food inflation
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.340]   and housing inflation, it's real, and it has a material impact on people's lives.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.900]   Long-term care, especially if you need memory care or someone in your family needs memory
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.900]   care.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.180]   I think a lot of boomers and Gen Xs are going to start to see this in their parents.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:15.860]   "Oh, you know, my relative, my mom has Alzheimer's, and we're looking at memory care, and by the
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:21.060]   way, that's $15,000 a month," and you're like, "Holy smoke, $180,000 a year, right?
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.620]   You're going to decimate portfolios this way."
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:30.660]   And then I think fraud and elder abuse is a real and growing threat.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.660]   I'll go backwards.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:37.580]   So for fraud, elder abuse, older people have more money, their decision-making may decline
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.140]   over time, and you need to be pretty thoughtful about how you hedge yourself out, and again,
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.180]   your parents, right?
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.660]   So monitoring spending.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.580]   One thought I've had about this is think about this like governance, right?
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.420]   Like having a board for your money.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.300]   When you're younger, it's you and your spouse, right?
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.020]   And then as maybe with your family, it's other people in your family, but having multiple
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.660]   trusted people that are keeping an eye on things, people that are aware and can help
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:07.100]   you make decisions, and that could be an external CFP, a CPA, but the whole thing about your
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:12.140]   mental acuity and functioning is that if your decision-making declines and you don't realize
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:17.660]   it, then you can have huge problems and a lifetime of savings can get misdirected or
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:23.020]   abused or get destroyed, which is not something you would want if you were aware of it.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.540]   Being able to assess yourself through your doctors and through outside experts and people
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.620]   in your family is super important.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.580]   Long-term care, potentially a deferred annuity, maximizing Social Security, just generally
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.360]   having a plan and thinking of this through in advance, again, it's a real cost.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.900]   Probably stay invested in the market, so you're going to capture higher returns, be thoughtful
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.340]   about what your mix is between fixed income and equities, but maybe bias equities a little
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.340]   bit more.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.260]   Longevity, we talked a bit before about the deferred annuity, maximizing Social Security,
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.180]   staying invested in the market.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.820]   Having a plan, just thinking about this and being aware of it is important so you have
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.820]   a sense of control.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.300]   For a lot of users, having a sense of control and understanding of their money and what's
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.920]   happening with it is a big benefit.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.300]   We touched on these topics in a couple of previous episodes, episode 34 with Cameron
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:13.500]   Huddleston, author of Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk, how to talk to your parents about
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.060]   their finances.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:22.460]   And then also Mike Piper was interviewed on episode 58 of this show about his book, More
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.460]   Than Enough.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.060]   I'll link to those shows in our show notes.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:33.860]   This question is from username Chigo from the Volgas Forums, who writes, "As do-it-yourselfers,
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.100]   what steps can a 50-something couple take now or later if they don't have children
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.180]   or family to handle their finances as they age?"
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:49.620]   This goes back to that governance idea, assemble a trusted group of people that are fiduciaries.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.020]   So it could be a CFP and a CPA and a lawyer.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.640]   Have three people involved.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.980]   You want to have other people that understand how the money works, understand what you want,
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.920]   are keeping an eye on things to make sure that there's no abuse happening.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.800]   I worked with a gentleman who had a similar situation, it was him and his wife, given
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.980]   her disinterest in personal finance and investing, he went over to his bank's trust department
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:20.320]   to set up a plan to have the money managed when he was no longer going to be able to.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.700]   One thing we discussed when working together is putting in fine print just how he wanted
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.320]   that money managed.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.760]   Because if you don't tell that corporate trustee, "Hey, use low cost funds, preferably index
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.200]   funds," then it's certainly possible they're going to default to their higher fee funds
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.040]   and you're probably not going to be happy when your spouse is paying those high fees.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.560]   That's a great point.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.160]   Trusts are this area that are growing and they're big businesses, there's a lot of money
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.600]   parked in these things and there's high fees and everything else.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.440]   So it is a valuable service, but yeah, you do have to keep an eye on it.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.320]   I remember talking with Rob Berger, he participates in this community.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   He talked about, I think it was the Big Blue Book or the Blue Binder, where he's written
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:11.820]   down for his spouse how it all works, where the money is, how to get access to it, how
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.440]   he's invested and why, and what the instructions are.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.880]   That can be for your spouse or you can set that up and give it to somebody else like
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.620]   a corporate trustee or your own governance board, whatever it is.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.280]   And at this year's BogleAds conference, Mike Piper will be leading a special session for
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.400]   those not necessarily financially nerdy spouses.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.380]   We spoke with Mike Piper on episode 36 of the BogleAds live show, where we discussed
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.880]   Mike's book, After the Death of Your Spouse, that talks about just this subject.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.800]   I'll link to that in the show notes so folks can check that out.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.280]   This question is from username MKC from the BogleAds forums, a moderator, thanks for help
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.880]   moderating the forums, MKC, who writes, "With the concern regarding online security of financial
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.440]   data, why require you to create an account and store your personal data on their servers
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.800]   versus making a local protected data set as an option?"
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.760]   We're a SaaS, so software as a service company, and that means we create one instance of our
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.160]   software on our servers and there's a data store on the servers and everything operates
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   off of that.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.840]   We do that for scale reasons and for quality control reasons.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.800]   So for us to support third party data stores, that's just like another enhancement on the
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.860]   roadmap and we haven't prioritized it yet.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.240]   It would still introduce some risk because you're transmitting the data back and forth
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.760]   and then you're relying on your own data security at your desktop.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.400]   In our business, we passed SOC2, which is a method of ensuring that we're doing the
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.480]   right best practices to keep data secure and people on our team are trained up.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   We also work with big companies like Nationwide and RTX, Raytheon, and they have their own
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.920]   security protocols that they make us pass on a repeated basis to make sure that we're
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.180]   securing the data.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:05.080]   So there's a lot of industrial strength security stuff going on here and we've designed in
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.760]   a way that you can abstract this.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.920]   So you can come, create a burner email account that's not associated with you, create an
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.440]   account with that email.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   You don't have to link your accounts.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.200]   You can just punch your numbers in and get a ballpark idea of what's happening.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.440]   That's an abstracted version of your plan that's not linked to your personal identity
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.000]   and manage it that way.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.920]   Certainly staying safe online is an important consideration.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.680]   That's why in episode 43 of the Bogleheads live show, we interviewed Steven Ryder, a
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.240]   cybersecurity expert.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.680]   So folks can check that out.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.000]   I'll link to that in our show notes.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.440]   This question is from username luckyone from the Bogleheads forums, who writes, what are
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:46.840]   the best resources for aiding in planning Roth conversions in retirement?
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:53.200]   The high level strategy is for many folks, their savings are in qualified accounts like
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.400]   your 401k IRAs and those are subject to RMDs, requirement distributions that start happening
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.440]   around 70 and then accelerate from there.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.200]   And if you live a long time, it could be taking out over 20% of your portfolio this year and
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   turning it into income.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.280]   And if you have a lot of money that can create a massive tax effect.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:16.440]   So the high level strategy is try to move money out of qualified accounts into a Roth.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.440]   So basically it grows tax free and come out tax free.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   It also has benefits.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.240]   If it goes to your estate, it can go to your estate in a very tax efficient way.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.080]   In our platform, we built a Roth conversion explorer, which looks at all your money, looks
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.600]   at your future incomes and marginal tax rates, and then lets you solve for lowest lifetime
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.400]   tax liability, or you want to solve for maximum estate in different kinds of scenarios.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.240]   You can plot out the kinds of conversions you can do and what the impact will be to
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.540]   your taxes for that year and long-term and make these trade-off decisions.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:54.100]   At the risk of making it sound like the Mike Piper show, Mike Piper did a phenomenal presentation
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.160]   at last year's Bogleheads conference about Roth conversions.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.960]   I'll link to that video in these show notes.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.600]   If you're listening to this recording, you still have a couple of weeks left to register
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.000]   if we're not sold out of tickets by the time you're listening.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.240]   Wood Spinner from the Bogleheads forums writes, "Are you able to leverage your software to
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.440]   calculate a funded ratio?"
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.040]   A funded ratio is just another way to calculate if you're on track for retirement.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.440]   Not to say it's any better or any worse than a Monte Carlo simulation, or perhaps even
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.240]   a linear projection using some conservative rates of return on a spreadsheet.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.700]   Funded ratio just says, "What is the total cost of all my future expenses today compared
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:42.220]   to what is the total value of all my investments today?"
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.620]   I think that's a great question.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.220]   I would say one thing that we're working on right now, which you'll hopefully see in the
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.960]   distant future, is a bunch of metrics around financial wellness.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:57.640]   So things like funded ratio, debt-to-income, what your risk is of running out of money.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.300]   These metrics, letting people explore them and see what's driving it, and then giving
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:07.140]   some insights to other changes they could make, to how they invest when they're planning
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:12.700]   to retire, how they're planning to draw assets, how they're positioning their assets to adjust
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.780]   their risk and achieve better long-term outcomes.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.060]   So you will definitely see that.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.460]   And if you're on our site and you want to suggest ways we could do better, we're definitely
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.100]   open to it.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:28.340]   Private ID from the Bogleheads forums asks about how financial planning software looks
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.640]   at not just one single financial planning question by itself.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.920]   Should I do a Roth conversion?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.000]   How much?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.380]   When should I start Social Security for the lower earner?
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.820]   What healthcare option should I be doing in retirement?
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.980]   How does retirement planning software look at all these pieces together?
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.840]   Generally what we're doing is getting as high a resolution picture of someone's situation
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.220]   as humanly possible, all across your income, expenses, assets, and debts.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:59.100]   And we do let people change things like, "Oh, I think my expenses will change over time."
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.460]   So my expenses are one way now, my kids go to college, they go up, my kids leave college,
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.020]   they go down, I retire, they change, whatever, I move, all this stuff.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.680]   So we're trying to understand what your plan is generally.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:14.400]   And then what we do is we use compute to run lots of scenarios.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.500]   So that when we're solving for things like Roth conversions, or what is the maximum income
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.980]   I could have, we basically run scenarios to scenario, and then pick the best result for
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.980]   you.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:30.860]   We touched on an important point here that Mike Piper made at a presentation he did at
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.660]   the Booklets Conference last year.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.980]   You've got to use some sort of software if you're going to make these really in-depth
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.860]   calculations, even something as simple as that Roth conversion, because while you might
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:47.040]   be looking at the marginal tax rate, you also want to be considering other credits or taxation
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.300]   of Social Security, for example, that's going to be impacted.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.580]   To paraphrase Mike, you don't want to be using a spreadsheet.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.740]   You want to be using software to make these calculations.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:03.100]   This question is from username Nobody from the Bogleheads forums, who asks, "How are
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:10.340]   other DIYers modeling their portfolio with regard to tax rates in the future?
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.540]   Is everyone planning for tax rates to revert in 2026?"
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:20.700]   That is the sun setting of the Tax Cut and Job Act tax holiday that we're currently enjoying.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.180]   If there isn't any new legislation passed, we're going to be looking at higher taxes
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.180]   come 2026.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:33.920]   Yeah, this was a popular request in our software, so we actually built this.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.580]   If you go into our software and go into My Plan Assumptions, you can go down to Taxes
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:44.900]   and toggle Use Current Tax Rates or Change to 2017 Tax Rates.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.460]   See how your plan works in those different scenarios.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:53.380]   That's the kind of thing we hear from our users, and we will add to the platform.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.140]   Another big thing that we're doing is just building scenarios.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.820]   I have a scenario and I retire at 55 versus 60.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.820]   What does that mean?
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.940]   Being able to quickly move between these things and create and delete them has been a super
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.300]   popular thing.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:11.200]   This question is from WannaRetireEarly, who gives us lots of great questions.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:17.860]   They write, "At what point should we stop DIYing at a certain portfolio amount, age,
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.500]   or life phase, etc?"
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.660]   I think this is a personal decision.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:28.180]   Per the earlier comments, I would say, over time, getting more people involved, more trusted
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.540]   people involved in your money, just as a hedging thing, is probably a good idea.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.020]   And even along the way, having external checkpoints.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.140]   We all have our own biases and beliefs about what we're doing and why we're doing it.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.820]   It's Morgan Housel talked about this.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.780]   The value of a financial advisor is just that they're not you.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.760]   It's somebody else looking at your money objectively.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.200]   You don't have the emotional tie-ins and hang-ups that come with it.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.440]   And they can maybe encourage you to take action and get you to realize that not taking action
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.000]   is an action and that might have a real penalty.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.740]   So I think that if you're completely DIY, talk to somebody else.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.540]   It doesn't have to be a long-term thing.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.780]   It can be a one-off thing, but just get a fiduciary expert to take a look at your situation.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.660]   And then probably on a regular basis, doing that.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.600]   And if you're having big events, doing it.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.940]   And as you get older, making sure you're set up appropriately and the right people have
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.580]   the right access so that you can avoid getting taken advantage of.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:32.260]   Our last question comes from username CoolAsADog from the Bogleheads forums, who writes, "Your
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.780]   software uses the midpoint as the tool for the expected simulation.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.820]   Perhaps you can share with us how to understand the output."
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.500]   There's an assumptions button in the upper right-hand corner of our software that says,
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:51.020]   "What do I want to choose for both inflation and returns, optimistic, average, or pessimistic?"
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:56.140]   The higher the pessimistic and optimistic numbers, the higher the risk and the higher the volatility,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:01.240]   which we use to drive the Monte Carlo modeling that's happening under the covers.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:07.580]   And we do default to the median, but we let you pick different ways to model this.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:13.100]   You can model your plan in an optimistic situation and a pessimistic situation as well.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.860]   So the default is average, but if you click it up, it's going to recast your entire plan.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:23.580]   And as you dial up risk, your expected returns will go higher, but your volatility will go
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.580]   higher too.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.860]   We have a Monte Carlo Explorer where you can come in and vary investment returns, vary
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.780]   inflation to vary medical inflation and vary wage growth.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.140]   So you can add in additional volatility to your entire plan.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.340]   Let me ask you another geeky Monte Carlo simulation question.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.260]   This is something we discussed in a previous episode.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:50.260]   That when it comes to targeting a success rate, what's the maximum worth even targeting?
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:55.660]   You want to look for 80, 85% success rate for what you're doing.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:59.420]   I do think, like what we talked about earlier, it would be better for us to present this
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:05.180]   in the form of guardrails and what that actually means in terms of what the lifestyle change
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.300]   would be for you.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.940]   And it would help a lot of people sleep better at night.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.900]   So that is something we're looking at for sure.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.700]   And I think you'll see in our software and then understand, Hey, if you're way under,
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.100]   if you're under 30%, then you're going to have to be pretty thoughtful about working
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.860]   longer, claiming social security better, thinking about your expenses in a big way.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.460]   That's going to be a big part of your plan.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:32.660]   One thing that I've learned from understanding how Monte Carlo simulations work is that there
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:38.060]   isn't mean reversion in Monte Carlo simulations and mean reversion just means that if it goes
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.660]   up, it's going to go down and vice versa.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.660]   This is what we've seen with the stock market.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:47.460]   Historically, any market crashes are met with a recovery and every recovery is followed
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.460]   by a market crash, but you don't necessarily always get that in a Monte Carlo simulation
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.160]   because it can be random.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.820]   So in a Monte Carlo simulation, you can have several simulations where the market goes
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.360]   down and down and down, and that's not realistic.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.060]   And it's those extreme events that perhaps we can ignore.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.440]   Perhaps say you mentioned an 80, 85% success rate is all you want to be considering because
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.700]   those really high success rates, such as 99% are looking at things that probably won't
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.740]   happen anyway, assuming that the global economy doesn't collapse.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.380]   What are your thoughts on that, Steve?
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.420]   With Monte Carlo, we run like a thousand simulations.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:27.140]   So you're running lots of paths and yeah, some of them are going to have bad outcomes,
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.500]   but generally the idea is that it'll give you a sense for how the market could behave.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.040]   Steve, thanks so much for joining us today.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.820]   Any final thoughts before I let you go?
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.580]   I really appreciate the opportunity to be here.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.580]   It really is an honor.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.740]   I'm a big fan of Bogleheads, Vanguard, Jack Bogle, what he did for the industry.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:50.960]   He single-handedly changed the outcomes for millions and millions of individual investors
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.580]   and he's changed the whole industry by bringing fees down and bringing more efficiency and
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.580]   transparency.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.500]   So it is awesome to be on here.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.580]   Appreciate the community and everything we've learned with Bogleheads members and anyone
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.580]   who signs up.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.800]   I really appreciate the support.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.120]   If you're free or paid, all feedback is welcome.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.840]   Feel free to message me ideas about how we can do better.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   And Steve, I know you mentioned you're planning on attending the conference this year.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.880]   So folks, if you want to give Steve your feedback in person, make sure to register for the 2023
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.200]   Bogleheads conference.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.160]   That's boglecenter.net/2023conference.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.440]   There might still be a few tickets left.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:31.400]   Steve, thanks again for joining us on the show today.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   Thanks for having me, John.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   I really appreciate it.
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.820]   And that wraps up our interview with Steve Chen.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:43.340]   It also wraps up me guest hosting the Bogleheads On Investing podcast.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.020]   Next month, your normal host, Rick Fieri, will be returning.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:53.460]   With me having completed my duties as guest host for the Bogleheads On Investing podcast,
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.420]   I'll be returning to our Bogleheads live series.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.820]   That is where the do-it-yourself investor community asks their questions to financial
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.740]   experts live on Twitter.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:10.680]   For folks that can't make the live events, episodes are recorded and turned into a podcast.
