[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:13.320]   in the Gospel according to St. Luke, in chapter 16, from verse 19 to the end of the chapter,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.140]   from verse 19 to verse 31. In other words, in the sixteenth chapter of the Gospel according
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.960]   to St. Luke, it is our Lord's statement, the well-known and familiar statement concerning
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:40.080]   the rich men and the beggar Lazarus. Now you notice that we are not told that this is a
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:49.400]   parable, so one deduces that it is a true story, a true statement. Our Lord was not
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:01:01.960]   speaking a parable here. He was making a statement of fact. This is perhaps the most solemn statement
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:13.000]   that our Lord ever made, the most solemn statement even that our Lord himself ever made. And
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.720]   I would ask you to bear in mind as we consider the statement, that it is his statement. It
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.360]   isn't mine. It isn't even that of one of the apostles. It is the statement of the Son
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.840]   of God himself. So what we are going to examine and look at
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.240]   together comes to us with no less an authority than that. There are things here that no human
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.120]   being could say, things which no human being has a right to say. It is a statement by the
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:58.200]   one who said, "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father." This is the statement of the
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.240]   incarnate God, the incarnation of the love of God. And that, of course, adds a peculiar
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.280]   authority to it and a peculiar solemnity and seriousness.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.320]   Now why did our Lord ever make this statement? The answer is, of course, that he made it
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.440]   in order to illustrate and to emphasize his teaching. And he spoke it, it seems to me,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   in particular to emphasize and to underline and to reiterate and to enforce what he had
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.120]   been saying as it is recorded in the first eighteen verses of the chapter.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.720]   Our Lord always had a reason for saying a thing like this. This is true, of course,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.120]   of all his parables. He spoke them in order to illustrate a point or something in his
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.520]   message. And he tells this story in exactly the same way. It is to bring home to people
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.080]   in the form of an illustration what he had already been laying down, more in the form,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.320]   perhaps, of direct teaching and propositions. Here we shall find that all the essential
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.000]   characteristics of his teaching are held before us with very great clarity.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.280]   Now let me first of all remind you of some of the general characteristics of his teaching.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.720]   I am doing this, my dear friends, because there is so much confusion in this modern
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.560]   world of ours as to what his teaching is. Of all the tragedies in the world, the greatest
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.160]   is the confusion as to the Christian message, the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.720]   Let us look at its general characteristics. What is it that characterizes his teaching
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.100]   as we have it in this story? Well, the first thing is this. It is a teaching which is entirely
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:04.880]   different from the teaching of everybody else. There is an authority, a power, an understanding,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.080]   which you will never find in any other speaker. That Roman soldier that was sent to arrest
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.160]   him said the simple truth when he said, "No man ever spake like this man." Everybody
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   noticed that this man speaketh with authority and not as the scribes and Pharisees. It is
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.760]   unique teaching and therefore it is surprising teaching. He cuts across all our modes of
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:39.580]   thought. He does not think as we think. He stands alone and his message is quite unique.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.320]   The second thing that is always characteristic of his message is that it is a call for thought,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:54.200]   a call for reason, a call for wisdom. Now, I am emphasizing this for this reason that
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.680]   the popular and the common thing to say about Christianity is that it is just feeble sentimentality,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.420]   emotionalism, and that people who are Christians are Christians because they do not think,
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.320]   because they do not reason, because they do not use their brains. They just abdicate from
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.000]   all thought, pull down the blinds, and let themselves go in some kind of emotional riot.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.220]   There is nothing which is further removed from the truth than just that. Now, that comes
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:30.240]   out very prominently here. You see, it is this rich man, Divey, who is interested in
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.600]   phenomena and something exciting. Do not you see him arguing with Moses? He says, "Look
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.440]   here, if you send somebody from the dead to speak to them, they will repent. Give them
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.360]   something exciting, some phenomenon." "Oh no," says Moses. People do not become Christians
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.240]   like that. It is Moses and the prophet. You know, our Lord spoke this parable of his about
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.400]   the rich man and his steward. In order to make this very point, you remember this man.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.320]   He was the steward of a rich man and he had done something wrong and he realized he was
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.000]   going to be dismissed. What does he do? Well, he says, "I am going to be in trouble, so
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I better make some preparation." So he called the debtors and he said, "How much do you
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.800]   owe?" "Well," he said, "I owe a hundred measures of oil," writes the steward. "You just scratch
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.160]   that out and put down fifty instead." He ingratiates himself with this man, knowing this man will
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.920]   therefore help him. The same with the other who owed a hundred measures of wheat. "Reduce
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.500]   that to eighty," he said. This is what I am told. The Lord commended the unjust steward
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.600]   because he had done wisely. In other words, the men began to think. We are told that about
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.240]   him. Then the steward said within himself, "What shall I do?" He asks a question. He
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.200]   faces his position. He begins to reason about it and he decides what to do. Our Lord commends
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.520]   that. Now that is typical Christianity. He goes on to say, "I say unto you, make yourselves
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.840]   friends of the men of unrighteousness, that when you fail, when you come to die, they
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   may receive you into everlasting habitation." In other words, the whole burden of his teaching
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.320]   in the whole chapter is to urge us to think and to reason and to prepare and really to
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.960]   face the facts of our situation in this life and in this world. He always does that. The
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   gospel of Jesus Christ calls everybody to stop and to think and to ask certain questions.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.400]   There is nothing under the sun that does that tonight but this. Your newspapers are interesting
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.320]   you, entertaining you. Your television, your wireless, your drink, your gambling, all of
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.960]   them are stopping your thinking. Here is the only thing that asks you to think.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.960]   Very well. The third characteristic is this. The teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ always
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.720]   makes the problem of life something which is essentially simple. Don't you feel that
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   as you heard this great story again? It is we who make the complications, our palaces,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.320]   our finery, our drink, our business, and all these things. We make the complications. There
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   is something strikingly, starkly simple about our Lord's view of it all. He reduces all
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   the complications concerning life to just one or two primary principles. That is why
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.240]   the gospel is simple. It gets at the heart of the matter. It is not lost in details.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.840]   It is we who are guilty of that. We miss the wood because of the trees. We miss the big
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.800]   things in life. We are interested in so many different things. We never pay attention to
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   the really big and vital and lasting things. But our Lord, as here, always brings us back
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.720]   to the fundamentals, to the essential simplicities. You know there are very few things that we
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.320]   really need to know about life. He always talks about them.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.640]   The fourth characteristic is that he always brings it to this, that there are only two
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   ways, only two possibilities. You see, in this picture there are two men. One is right,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:20.800]   one is wrong. He has already put it in words in verse 13. "No servant can serve two masters.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:27.120]   Either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   the other. Either or, he cannot serve God and mammon." Mammon does not only mean money;
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.320]   he means the world, all that money can buy, all that people are interested in. It is either
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   or. There are only two ways. The Bible is full of this ultimate choice, and it brings
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   it down to just these two things. Then, of course, having said that, it always calls
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:00.080]   for a choice and for a decision. You have got to decide whether you serve God or mammon.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.760]   You have got to decide whether you live like Divey's The Rich Man or whether you live like
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   Lazarus. You have got to decide. Indeed, even Divey sees this. Divey himself, The Rich Man,
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.280]   helps to emphasize this point. He says, "Look here, Father, I would that thou wouldst send
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.600]   Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brethren, that he may testify unto them, lest
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   they also may come to this place of torment." Then he argues again. He says, "Nay, Father
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.360]   Abram, if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent." Even he sees it now. He
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.800]   says, "These people need to think again. They need to change their minds. They need
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.960]   to take the right choice." At the moment they are taking the wrong choice, as I took
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:46.080]   the wrong choice, send Lazarus to warn them that they may take the right choice and live
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   accordingly. He always calls for a choice and for a decision. "Choose this day whom
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:00.480]   ye will serve." That is the great statement running right through the Bible. Who do you
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   belong to? Who are you following? We are confronted by this either/or, God, or everything that
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:16.400]   is opposed to God. And lastly, of course, and here in a supreme manner, our Lord always
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.600]   emphasizes the tragic folly of making the wrong choice.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.560]   Very well, my friends, there are the general characteristics of his teaching, which he
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.560]   now illustrates by stating this dramatic story concerning these two men. What does he want
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:44.320]   to teach? What is his message? I will summarize it for you under three principles. Here is
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:52.640]   the first. The most important thing in life. What is the most important thing in life?
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.000]   That is what the gospel is about. It is about life. And it brings us immediately to this
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   question, "What is the most important thing in life, in this world?" That is the simplicity
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.200]   that he holds before us in this naked, stark manner. What is it? Well, now, let us see
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   how he works it out. First of all, he tells us what is not important. And, of course,
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.080]   you will notice that what he says is unimportant is what we regard as tremendously important.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.600]   That is why I said that his message is always different from every other, and it is always
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.360]   surprising. He cuts across all our thinking. What is unimportant? What is the thing that
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.880]   rarely we should not put first? Well, first of all, he says, "Do not put circumstances
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.080]   first." "What do you mean?" says someone. "Well, I will tell you. Look at this rich
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   man, David, the man who was so wrong, the man who finds himself in misery and wretchedness.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:02.280]   What did he put first? He put first circumstances. What were they? Well, rich. He is a rich man.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:10.520]   He is clothed in purple and fine linen. He fed sumptuously every day. He is reminded
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   by Abraham that he had his good things when he was in this world of time. What about the
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:25.400]   other men? Lazarus, well, he is a beggar. He does not live in the palace. He lives at the
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.200]   gate. He is even lying at the gate. The dogs are there licking his wounds. What does he
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:38.040]   eat? Does he fare sumptuously? No. He is desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   the rich man's table. This is our Lord's account. This is our Lord's picture. And you see, to
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:54.560]   him this is unimportant. This is not what matters. But you see, to David, to the rich
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:01.240]   men it mattered tremendously, and it matters to people today. This is what the world is
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   putting before God and Christ tonight. Riches. Money. Look what it can buy. That's why men
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.520]   and women by the thousand, perhaps million tonight, are working out football pools. Money.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.680]   This vast sum of money. Marvelous. They want to be rich. You can do so much when you've
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.160]   got riches. That's the way really to enjoy life in this world, to have plenty of money.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   Rich. Clothed in purple and fine linen. What a picture. There it is in the picture.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   There it is in all the society magazines. It comes into the daily newspapers. Slacks,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:43.680]   clothes, figure. Wonderful. This is what makes life. Purple and fine linen. Marvelous. It's
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:53.640]   the badge of greatness. It's the talisman that gives you entry into the places that
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:59.920]   really matter. Oh, the time and the attention that is given to clothing and to money and
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.040]   the thought about all these things and then the fairing sumptuously, the dinners and the
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.360]   menu and the wine and the... Marvelous. And writing about it, articles about it. What's
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.640]   recommended this week. You'll see it in the popular... And even in the more learned weekly
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:21.080]   journals that the attention that is made to how you fair, to your diet, to your food,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   to your feasting, fared sumptuously. Good things. Yes. The supposed good time. Having
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:36.080]   a good time. Going up to London to have a good time. Here it is with all the perfect
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:43.080]   description of which our Lord alone is capable. But you see, our Lord makes nothing of these
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.400]   things. There's other men, he's a beggar, he's got nothing. Now, this isn't to commend
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:55.840]   poverty or beggary, of course not. That's not the point our Lord's making. All he's
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.120]   saying is this, this is not the thing that matters primarily. This is not the thing you
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.760]   put first. This is not the thing you live for. That's what's wrong. We need food, we
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.960]   need clothing, we need all these things, but we don't live for them. These men lived for
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.960]   them. The other men regarded them as indifferent. They really didn't matter. He was concerned
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.560]   about something else. Well, now there's one thing. Another thing you see that our Lord
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   shows to be so unimportant is the life of the body. This rich man was very healthy,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:35.160]   lived a very healthy life. The other men at his gate, we are told, were full of sores.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   But you see in this story, that's comparatively insignificant and unimportant. Our Lord doesn't
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.880]   make a big point of this. This isn't why he spoke the story. In order to talk about
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.720]   health and extension of our life in this world and the health of the body and the deliverance
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.800]   of the body from illness and diseases. No, no, he's not interested. That's comparatively
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.600]   unimportant. Again, don't misunderstand. That doesn't mean to say that the Christian
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:06.840]   teaching is that health doesn't matter. It does matter, but again you don't put it first.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.320]   Health of body is not the first thing. It's not the greatest thing. But the state's very
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.000]   concerned about this. We all are. And while we are concentrating on the health of the
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.200]   body and the extension of the little time we spend in this world, we are neglecting
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:27.360]   something more important. He's not interested very much in the life of the body.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.680]   And the third thing I note negatively is this. That he doesn't seem to be very concerned
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   as to the cause of death. All our Lord tells us is that the two men died. Doesn't tell
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.280]   us what they died of. Why? Well it doesn't matter, you know. What does it matter what
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.240]   a man dies of? Matters to a doctor? He's got to put it on the death certificate. Matters
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.960]   to the state and its records? Doesn't matter, you know. In eternity? Doesn't matter in the
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.080]   sight of God? Whether you die quietly in your bed or killed on a field of battle or exploded
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   by a bomb? It doesn't matter. The cause of death to our Lord is insignificant. It doesn't
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:13.600]   matter. But this is what the world concentrates on, isn't it? The world puts this on the front
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.360]   page. This is the big thing. It doesn't ask how exactly did a man face the end. It says
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.960]   now was he killed by a bomb? Was he killed in war? With a great excitement as to the
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.880]   cause of death. But according to our Lord's teaching, this is comparatively insignificant
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.760]   and unimportant. Well what is important? What is it that really matters in life? What is
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:42.000]   the most important thing of all? Our Lord answers the question. It is a man's outlook
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   upon life. It is a man's attitude to life. What does our Lord say is really important?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.760]   Well now look at this story for yourselves. Analyze it and you'll discover a most extraordinary
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:04.760]   thing. The thing our Lord puts first is this. Is the fact of death. Indeed this whole story
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:15.320]   is really an expanded treatment of the whole question of the fact of death. Did you notice
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.080]   that? Our Lord you see seems to dismiss the life of these two men in very brief compass.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.420]   There was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.120]   every day. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.120]   of sorge and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.600]   the dogs came and licked his sorge. That's all our Lord has got to say about the earthly
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   life of those two men. Just that and no more. Then he goes on. Now he begins to deal with
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:52.440]   his theme. And it came to pass. What came to pass? Oh what came to pass was that the
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:20:05.800]   two men died. It came to pass that the beggar died. The rich man also died. This is the
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.160]   thing that our Lord is interested in. All that goes before, well he just mentions it
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.800]   that we may have some idea of the two men, but he says the really important thing is
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:21.200]   this. The two men died. And from there on he begins to show the essential difference
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   between the two. It came to pass. And it always comes to pass. It has come to pass about everybody
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   who has ever lived in this world before us. It came to pass that they died. And it will
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:49.960]   come to pass my dear friends that you and I will die. This is what our Lord is interested
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:56.720]   in. All the antecedents he summarizes very briefly. Then he gives the rest of his time
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   to say now then this is the thing. They both died. This world is only a temporary thing.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:10.680]   The gospel of Jesus Christ primarily is not to prepare us for life in this world. It is
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.880]   to prepare us for life in the next world. Because as I am going to show you it is only
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.040]   the man who is prepared for the next who knows how to live in this. So he puts this first.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.600]   Then you see what he also emphasizes is this. Is the state of a man so? His condition as
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   he dies. Not the cause of his death. Not the physical cause. But the state of the man's
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   soul. And in other words he is interested in a man's relationship to God and his eternal
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:46.800]   destiny. That according to our Lord is the most important thing in life. Not your wealth
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:56.760]   or your poverty. Not your clothing and your decorations. Not the amount of food you eat.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:05.180]   Not the state of your physical health. These things that absorb us and our time and attention
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.320]   about which we think and dream and plan so much. My dear friends our Lord says these
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   are not the things. This is the thing that matters. How you die. The state of your soul.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:29.380]   Your relationship to God. Your eternal destiny. Very well. Let me come to my second proposition.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:36.060]   Why is it that that is the most important thing of all? Our Lord lays that down as a
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:41.120]   proposition that that is the most important thing. Now then let's consider this. Why is
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   this the most important thing of all? Well he answers the question abundantly. The first
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.700]   answer he gives is that this is the most important thing of all because this determines as I
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:00.700]   say the way in which we live. And what we make of life in this world. As a man thinks
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:08.620]   or thinketh so he is and so he does. You see every man of us is showing his philosophy
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:14.240]   of life by the way in which he is living. Our living, our practice, our conduct and
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.860]   behavior is nothing but the outworking and the expression of what we rarely believe.
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.140]   And the people who are living the kind of life that this rich man lived tonight are
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.500]   doing so because that's their view of life. That's their philosophy of life. What a man
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   thinks so he is so he does. Though he has lived one kind of life because that's the
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:40.580]   sort of life he believed in. That was his view of life. Life to him was a place in which
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:47.140]   a man has a good time, has his good things, has his palace and his food and his purple
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.940]   and fine linen and all the rest of it. That's he says the way to live. That's the way for
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:58.940]   a man to enjoy himself. You see it determined the way in which he lived.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:06.820]   That is again I say why Dioves was so urgent that somebody should be said to warn his brothers.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.780]   He said you know they've got the wrong view of life. They are viewing it as I viewed it.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.660]   I see my mistake now go and tell them. Tell them to see it then. You notice the word that
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.660]   he used. What an extraordinary thing. He has a sermon from hell. He said nay Father Abram
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.500]   but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent. Repentance means not only that
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:31.300]   you think again but that you turn round. That you start doing something you never did before
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:36.180]   and stop doing what you had been doing before. Repentance is a change of mind, a change of
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:43.180]   outlook and a change of behavior. And that is why our blessed Lord himself says this
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:52.340]   to us. I say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness. That when
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:58.860]   you fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations. What he means is this. He says
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:05.860]   now look here. Get a right view of life. Begin to look at your life in the light of eternity.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:13.220]   Then realizing that you are destined for eternity make a right use of your money while you are
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.900]   alive. Don't live for yourself. Don't spend your money on your clothing and on your food
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.580]   and on your drink and on your pleasures. Make to yourselves friends. Use your money in a
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.660]   right way so that when you do die you will find that it will have paid you to do so.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:34.620]   You see your view of life determines the way that you live. It will determine your use
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:39.100]   of your money and of all your talents and of all your faculties. There is no question
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.300]   about that. We have all got the same faculties, the same talents in various measures. Well
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.100]   what determines how a man lives in this world? Oh what decides that is. A man's view, his
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:55.520]   total view of life. Now I could illustrate this to you at great length. You look at the
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.140]   great men who are pictured in the Bible, the great patriarchs, the great saints. They were
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:07.860]   men who suffered and endured a lot. Why did they do so? Look at a man like Moses. Moses
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.620]   you know if he had played his cards properly he could have been a very great man. He had
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.620]   been adopted by Pharaoh's daughter. He was regarded as her son. He could have been a
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:21.140]   great general. He could have been a prince. He might have had anything. But he didn't
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:26.300]   you remember? He had a very troubled life. Why? Well you ask the author of the epistle
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.780]   to the Hebrews and he will tell you that the whole secret was this. He chose, he preferred
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:37.620]   to suffer affliction with the people of God rather than to endure the pleasures of sin
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.500]   for a season. The man took a long view. He had got a philosophy of life. He said I am
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.220]   only here for a while. Eternity lies ahead of me. And because he had that view he decided
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.380]   to live like this. He preferred to suffer affliction with the people of God rather than
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.220]   to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. He didn't just plunge into pleasures. He said
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:02.140]   how long do they last? He began to ask questions. He thought he had a view of life and his whole
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:08.700]   conduct was determined and governed by that. And that's exactly what our Lord is teaching
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:15.300]   right through this chapter. This is the most important thing in life and in this world
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:21.500]   because it determines the way in which we live. The greatest benefactors this world
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.780]   has ever known have been the Christian saints. Why? Well you see they realized their responsibility
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.860]   to God and they didn't live a selfish life. They lived a life of service. They lived as
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.740]   Christ had lived. They did their utmost to follow him because of their view of what was
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:41.780]   coming. But let me give you another reason why this is the most important and chiefest
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:52.940]   thing. It not only determines how a man lives in this world, it affects the actual mode
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:59.460]   of death. Now there's a difference between the cause of death and the mode of death.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.980]   The cause of death as I say may be one of many things. It may be illness, it may be
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.660]   accident, it may be a bomb, it may be war. That's the cause of death. Our Lord's not
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.740]   interested in that. But he's very interested in the mode of death. Did you notice it? This
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.820]   is one of the most wonderful things in this story. It came to pass that the beggar died
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:27.940]   and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:37.620]   That's what I mean by a difference in the mode of death. What a difference, what a contrast.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:43.620]   The rich man dies and all we can be told about him is that he was buried. But what we are
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:49.500]   told about the other man is that when he died he was carried by the angels into Abraham's
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:57.180]   bosom. The way a man goes out of this life and into the next is altogether different
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:06.660]   according to the view which he holds on these matters. The rich man died alone. He couldn't
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:11.580]   take his boon companions with him. He can't take his purple and his fine linen. He can't
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:18.820]   take his great feast and his sideboard. He can take none of these things. He goes empty
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:28.940]   handed without a friend. He goes alone, unattended, buried. But not so Lazarus. Here is one who
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:35.900]   is taken hold of by the angels and born on angels' wings into the bosom of Abraham in
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:41.500]   heaven. Oh, is there anything more important than this, than the mode of death, the way
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.860]   in which we die? You see, it's got to come to every one of us. It came to pass, I say.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.460]   It will come to pass about you. Somebody will say about you, "It came to pass that at
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:55.180]   a given point he died." And then how do you die? This last great journey, this exit,
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:02.260]   this quietus, how do you make it? Are you going out of it alone and just be buried like
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:11.300]   a dog? Or will you be carried on angels' wings? There's nothing more wonderful about
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:16.460]   this Christian message than just this, that it affects so vitally the actual mode of death.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:21.700]   Oh, the Bible's full of this sort of thing. It talks about the Christians falling on sleep.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.860]   Listen to the Apostle Paul, oh, he puts it. He says to the Philippians, "I am in a
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:31.100]   strait between two things. It's better for you that I should remain, but as for myself,
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:37.660]   I prefer," he says, "to go on, to be with Christ, which is far better. For me to live
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:43.660]   is Christ and to die is gain." That's how he views it. But listen to him at the very
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:50.400]   end of his life. Here he is, an old man. Death is at the door. And he looks into the face
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.700]   of death and he says, "I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.660]   at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my cause. I have kept the faith.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:04.420]   Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.420]   judge, shall give me at that day. And not only unto me, but unto all them also that
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:16.180]   love is appearing." That's the way to die. Listen to Peter. Peter, writing again as an
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.900]   old man at the end of his life in his second epistle, chapter one, says, "I've got to
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.540]   put off this, my tabernacle. That's all it is, this old body of which the world makes
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:29.500]   so much in its food, its clothing, its health, and all the rest of it. My tabernacle, it's
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.860]   only a tent," says Peter. "It's only a temporary residence. I've got to put off this, my earthly
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:41.860]   tabernacle. I know it's coming soon, but it's all right." He knows where he's going. He'll
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:49.380]   not be alone. Born on the wings of angels into Abraham's bosom. My friend, this is the
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:59.780]   thing our Lord's emphasizing, not what causes your death, but the way in which you die.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:06.420]   Are you ready to die? Are you ready to go out of this life? Day by day, people are going
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:12.140]   out of it. They're going out in different ways. We've had great reminders of that during
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:19.140]   this last week, haven't we? There are many ways of going out of this life. I need say
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:27.660]   no more. You know what I've got in my mind? It's in your mind. How are you going out?
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.940]   Can you look forward to the wings of angels bearing you? Do you know that when you cross
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:37.340]   that last river, when you make your final exit, that you'll not be alone? You'll be
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:42.060]   surrounded by the angels of God. You'll see the brightness of their glory. They'll keep
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:47.020]   you from all harm, all pain, all wretchedness, all agony. They'll be with you, and they'll
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:54.020]   support you, they'll undertake for you, they'll carry you to the very bosom of God Himself.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:33:00.340]   Oh, I say this is the most important thing in life, because it not only determines how
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:06.380]   we live, it determines how we die. But let me go on. It also affects our state after
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.860]   death. And this is the thing which our Lord is emphasizing. Is there ever a bigger contrast
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:16.340]   found anywhere in all literature than what we find here? Here's the rich man in hell.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.780]   He'll lift up his eyes, being in torment, and see that Abram afar off, and Lazarus in
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:27.780]   his bosom, the contrast. You see, the way you view life determines your state after
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:34.700]   death, as well as the mode of your death. And of course, the contrast is pointed once
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:41.540]   and forever by Abram. Abram said, "Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:48.540]   thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted, and thou
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:34:01.540]   art tormented." I say, as I said at the beginning, no one has a right to speak like
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:09.500]   this except the Son of God. I can't see beyond the veil, you can't, nobody can. Your great
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.300]   philosopher says he doesn't believe in it, he doesn't know. He knows no more than you
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.300]   and I do. He's purely speculating. It's only his own idea. Here is the only one who has
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:25.300]   a right to speak. He's come from there. He knows, and it's he who says it. And he says
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:33.460]   that there are only two destinies, heaven and hell. And it is the difference between
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:40.540]   the bliss and the peace and the joy of heaven, and the flame and the torment and the agony
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:48.180]   and the misery of hell. You see, hell means a place of eternal remorse.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:53.660]   Divey sees his error, sees his mistake. He's suffering in the flame. He wishes he could
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:35:00.660]   get out of it. He's suffering. That's the thing that our Lord emphasizes. This view
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:09.460]   which we take of life in this world is going to determine our state after death, and it's
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:16.460]   going to be one of these too. But let me add the final word. It not only affects our state
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:23.500]   after death, it affects that state unchangeably and eternally. Beside all this between us
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:32.860]   and you, there is a great gulf fixed, so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot,
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:39.860]   neither can they pass to us that would come from thence. I say again, I wouldn't dare
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:44.140]   say a thing like this. It's the Son of God who says it. It's the Lord Jesus Christ who
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:49.460]   says it. It's the one that so loved the world that he gave himself upon that cross. It's
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:55.220]   the incarnation of God's love who says it. He says that our state is eternally fixed,
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.740]   everlastingly, unchangeably. Though you may see your wrong, then you can't get out of
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:06.740]   it. It's fixed. The gulf is unbridgeable. Very well, my friends, it's just my simple
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:16.620]   duty to tell you this and to remind you of it. Men and women will tell you there's a
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.300]   second chance. How do they know? Oh, they say, "But the love of God makes the other
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.940]   impossible." Does it? Do you know more about the love of God than the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:32.380]   Stop a moment and think what you're saying. Stop your theorizing. Stop being clever. He
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:39.380]   says, and he is God incarnate, that there is an unbridgeable gulf, and that our eternal
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:54.820]   fate and destiny is decided in this life and in this world by what we believe.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:02.820]   Very well, that brings me to my third and my last proposition. How can I then get the
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:14.820]   right view of life? What am I to believe? What must happen to me? What must I do in
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:23.980]   order to make sure on this matter and avoid the fate of the rich men by this? The answer
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:30.980]   is perfectly simple. It's not a question of being frightened. That's why I've tried to
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:38.700]   control myself as I'm preaching tonight. I'm not here to frighten you. Nobody can ever
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.740]   be frightened into salvation. It's not a matter of being frightened. It's not a matter of
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.460]   some startling phenomenon that will awaken us and shake us. It's not the question of
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:54.460]   having a visible proof. These are the things which men make so much of, are they not? The
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:38:00.020]   man says, arguing like this rich man, "If only I knew, if only I had absolute proof,
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.380]   if only someone from the dead as it were could come, then I'd believe." "No, no," says
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:09.980]   Abraham, "you wouldn't." And it's our Lord who's saying the same thing. And of course,
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:15.140]   this is quite right. You would have thought that two world wars in this present century
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.660]   would have shaken the whole world, would have called everybody to repentance. You would
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.980]   have thought that people who passed through the bombing in the last war would never sin
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.380]   again. Did it have that effect? Of course it didn't. It drove them worse than they were
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:32.580]   before. Troubles and wars and problems very rarely make us better than we were before.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:38.260]   We are better for a while and then we forget it and all reverts to where it was before.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:44.980]   Indeed our Lord himself is very clear on this point. Abraham says here, "If they yearn
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:50.380]   not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.460]   What our Lord means is this, you see. He says, "Look here, you people are arguing that if
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.780]   only you had some tangible proof," he says, "you're getting it. Look at me." They saw
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.500]   him, they heard him, they saw his miracles. Did that make them believe? No, no. He could
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.100]   heal the sick, cure the lame and the blind. He could raise the dead. You would have thought
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:11.020]   that would have convinced everybody. The effect it had upon them was to make them crucify
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.740]   him. They say, "If a man literally rose from the dead, we'll believe he did rise from the
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:21.460]   dead." And still they don't believe. No, no, that's not the way. There's only one way.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:27.460]   "If they yearn not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:33.020]   rose from the dead." You notice how this is repeated here. "Abraham saith unto him, 'They
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.220]   have Moses and the prophets. Look here,' says the rich man in hell, 'I pray thee, Father
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.900]   Abram, that thou wouldst send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brethren,
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.220]   that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.' Abraham
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.260]   said unto him, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.' But he says, 'That isn't
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.860]   enough. There must be something more, some phenomenon, something striking, marvelous.'"
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:01.580]   No, no. If they don't hear Moses and the prophets, nothing else will persuade them.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:07.860]   That's why, my friends, I'm not trying to frighten you. That's why I never bring pressure
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:13.880]   to bear at the end of a service. I don't want to make people decide I can't. It's Moses
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.820]   and the prophets. That's why I don't tell affecting stories and play on your feelings.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:24.460]   It won't do it. It'll produce something temporary. It won't last. No, no, there's only one way.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:31.020]   The truth, Moses and the prophets, receiving, understanding this. Our Lord has already said
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.340]   it himself, the law and the prophets were until John. Since that time, the kingdom of
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:42.340]   God is preached, and every man who's got any sense presses into it. What's he talking about?
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:50.460]   Well, it comes to this. There's only one way to get the right view of life. It is to hear
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:56.260]   and to pay heed and to listen and to follow the teaching of Moses and the prophets. What's
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.420]   this? Well, here it is. You see, it's the whole Bible. Moses and the prophets, that's
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.100]   the whole of your Old Testament. Moses and the law. What does he teach us? What has Moses
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.900]   got to tell me? You want light? Listen to Moses. What is it? Well, it's all here, right
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:18.020]   in the Old Testament, the five books of Moses. What is it? Oh, it's about God. "In the beginning,
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.820]   God created the heaven and the earth and all that in them is. God making man in his own
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:29.260]   image. God revealing himself, the holiness of God, the righteousness of God. Man as a
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:34.700]   creature responsible to God." But then Moses goes on to tell us why we are as we are. Man's
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.580]   fall, man's sin, man's misery consequent upon it. But he doesn't leave it at that. The law
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:50.820]   of God. God's demands, the Ten Commandments. You must worship God and serve him only. You
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.660]   must not bow down to a grievan image. You must not take God's name in vain. You must
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:00.620]   observe his day. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit adultery,
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.100]   thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife or ox or ass.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:11.940]   Here it is, God's demand. Righteousness, holiness, purity of living. Why? Well, because God is
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:25.140]   going to judge us all. That's what Moses teaches. God's utter holiness, God's righteousness,
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:31.820]   God the judge of the whole earth. God calling upon men to serve him and to live to his glory,
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:39.820]   telling them he's going to judge them in terms of that. The judgment of God. And let's remember
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:50.100]   this as our Lord puts it here, "Ye are they which justify yourselves before men, but God
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:58.820]   seeth your hearts." That's how God is going to judge us, not by the outward shell, not
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:03.100]   by your morality, which is so much better than that of some sinner in a gutter. God
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:08.660]   seeth the heart. You may never have committed adultery, you may never have got drunk, but
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:13.340]   what about your heart? How often have you committed adultery in your heart? God knows
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:19.060]   your hearts. God sees us as we are. The judgment is a real one. He knows all about us. He knows
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.860]   the secret things and all will be laid open before him. That's the teaching of Moses.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:31.060]   Listen to it. And the teaching of the prophets is the same. But listen, we are told this
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.820]   about the law, "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:40.540]   fail." That's our Lord summing up of this matter. That's Moses' teaching, the law of
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:45.340]   a righteous and a holy God, making its demands and will be judged by it. And it will never
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:50.660]   fail. It will stand. Nothing can remove it. The prophets, what's their teaching? Exactly
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.580]   the same. They call the nation to repentance. They call the nation back to obedience to
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:01.020]   God. They warn it of judgment. They say that there is no hope for people unless they repent.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:07.020]   It's the universal teaching of all the prophets.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.460]   Let me then summarize for you the teaching of the law and the prophets, Moses and the
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:21.940]   prophets. It's this, that by the law is the knowledge of sin, which means this, that no
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:28.060]   man can ever justify himself before God. We think we can, of course. That's why our Lord
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:32.020]   says, "Ye are they that justify yourselves before men." You say, "Look at the life I'm
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.980]   living. Look at that man. What a wonderful life. There's a man who doesn't believe in
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.340]   Christ. He doesn't believe in God. But look at the good he's doing. Look at the sacrifice
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:43.260]   he's made, justifying himself, and the world praises him." What are we told about it? "God
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:50.700]   knoweth your hearts and that which is highly esteemed amongst men. Accarded in your newspapers,
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:59.300]   praised in the obituary notices. Marvelous men. Wonderful life. Abomination in the sight
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:09.540]   of God. Vileness, foulness, utter unworthiness." This is the verdict. There it is. No man can
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:15.860]   stand before God. No man can ever justify himself. No man can ever work up a righteousness
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.500]   that will satisfy God. That's what Moses and the prophet teach us. They condemn us.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.980]   We're all sin. We've all come short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no,
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:30.300]   but one. They say, "You need salvation. You're lost. You're hopeless." Moses and the prophets,
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:41.260]   have you heard them preaching? But thank God Moses and the prophets didn't stop at that.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:46.260]   That's how they begin, but they don't end like that. Moses and the prophets says, "Yes,
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:52.060]   you're lost. You're damned. You're helpless. You're hopeless. But there is a hope, and
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:57.980]   there's a hope that comes from God." Moses, Genesis 3, 15, "The seed of the woman shall
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:02.840]   bruise the serpent's head." Moses tells you that. You're without excuse. If you had nothing
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:07.140]   but your Old Testament, you've no right to go to hell. Moses tells you, "The seed of
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:15.560]   the woman." There's a man coming, born of a woman, who's going to redeem. And then go
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.700]   on and read the books of Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers. Do you ever read them? You ought
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.420]   to. You may find yourself in hell because you haven't read these. Don't listen to these
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:31.780]   fools who deride them. Read about the burnt offerings and the sacrifices. Read about the
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:36.540]   paschal lamb that was slain and the blood painted upon the doorposts as the children
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:41.900]   of Israel came out of Egypt. What's it all about? Oh, this is but a promise and a prophecy
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:47.660]   of a Lamb of God that is going to come, that shall save and take away the sin of the world.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:52.900]   Moses tells you that. All the types, all the blood of bulls and goats, the ashes of an
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:58.780]   heifer, offerings and sacrifices, they're all saying there's a Deliverer coming. God
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:04.660]   is going to provide a Lamb, a Messiah. Moses tells you that. Listen to him. It's the way
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:10.020]   to save you from the torment and from the flame. And the prophets join him in saying
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:18.260]   the same thing. "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith my God." Yes, there is one who's
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:25.220]   going to be led as a Lamb to the slaughter. "I see him," says Isaiah, "I see him with
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:32.140]   his visage marred, such that no man should desire him. I see him bruised, I see him smitten
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:37.860]   of God." Who's this? This is the Messiah. This is the Son of God that's going to come,
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.420]   the one who's going to bear our punishment in order that we may be reconciled to God
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:48.380]   and spare the torment of hell, repent and believe. Moses and the prophets are all preaching
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:54.660]   this great message to us. But you know, we're not left with it. The law and the prophets
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:00.420]   were until John, since that time the kingdom of God is preached. He says, "Look here, I'm
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:06.500]   the fulfillment of the prophecies of Moses and the prophets, and I have come, I am the
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:11.660]   Son of God, I have come to set up the kingdom of God. I'm here to open the gate. I'm going
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.980]   to have my body broken so that through me you can pass from hell to heaven, as it were,
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:21.780]   and from earth to heaven, and from man to God, and from judgment into life." The kingdom
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:34.100]   of God is preached. And so you see Moses and the prophets and the Son of God, and the apostles
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:39.980]   to whom he gave his message concerning himself, they come to us and they say this, "Realize
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:44.860]   the facts. You've got to die. It'll come to pass that you die and you'll stand before
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:49.500]   God. And as you are, you can't. You're lost. You're a sinner. You're damned. You're vile.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:49:02.180]   You can't stand in his presence." But listen, there is a way for men to be saved. We can't
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:09.340]   justify ourselves before God. We can before men, but not before God. And the great question
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:15.420]   is how can a man be just with God? How can a man stand righteous and just and free in
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:20.260]   the presence of God? Listen to the apostle Paul answering it once and forever. In Romans
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:25.620]   3 he says, "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:31.660]   sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin." But now the righteousness of God without
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:37.380]   the law, apart from the law, is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:41.620]   Moses and the prophets are witnesses to this great thing. They said it was coming. It's
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:47.980]   come. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested. It's revealed. "Even
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:53.060]   the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.780]   that believe. For there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:06.420]   of God, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:11.940]   whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:16.380]   righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God, to
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:22.900]   declare," I say at this time, "his righteousness, that he might be just and the justifier of
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:30.940]   him that believeth in Jesus." There it is, my friend, the preaching of the Son of God,
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:36.460]   witnessed unto by Moses and the prophets. It's happened. It's revealed. "For you and
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:41.100]   I are sinners, vile and hopeless, and can never put ourselves right. He, the Son of
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:46.340]   God, has come, taken our place, borne our punishment, to put us right with God." God
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:52.820]   was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Be justified by faith. You'll never
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:58.020]   make yourself right. He'll put you right. Not you or works, his righteousness. It's
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:03.580]   all by faith. It all simply means believing. That is why our Lord puts it like this. The
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:09.060]   Lord, the prophets, were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is preached,
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:13.860]   and every man presses into it. He's seen the condemnation. Moses and the Lord condemned
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.980]   him. They say the Messiah is coming. He's come, and they're pressing into it. They're
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:25.460]   running into it. Have you done that? Are you pressing, or have you pressed into the kingdom
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:34.060]   of God? Have you believed the message of the Lord, Moses and the prophets? Have you listened
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:39.100]   to the preaching of Davies from hell? Have you repented? If one went unto them from the
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:44.620]   dead, they'll repent. Have you done it? Have you seen the folly of your view of life and
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.980]   your way of life? Have you realized you've got to stand before God in judgment? Have
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.500]   you realized that there is an eternal misery ahead of you if you die as you are? Have you
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:58.660]   listened? Have you thought again? Have you repented? Have you changed your mind? Have
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:04.260]   you changed your life? Have you believed the message of free justification in Christ, who
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:10.900]   has been made a sin offering for us? And have you given proof that you've done it seriously,
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:17.340]   deliberately, genuinely, by turning from the world, renouncing its life, and giving
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:28.060]   yourself unreservedly and wholly unto our blessed Lord and Savior? That's the way.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:33.820]   If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:42.740]   the dead. Have you been persuaded by Moses and the prophets? Have you been persuaded
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:47.620]   by the Son of God? He tells you, "He came into the world to seek and to save that which
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:53.580]   was lost. He came because all had failed and none could ever succeed. He's in the world.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:58.340]   He came to it. He died because it's the only way." Have you heard him? Has he persuaded
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:12.380]   you? Has Daivis persuaded you? Have you pressed into the kingdom as the result of hearing
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:19.740]   and receiving and believing and acting on the message, my dear friend, if you do so?
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:27.540]   When your time comes to die, you will likewise be carried by the angels on their blessed
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:36.100]   wings into the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ to be with him which is far better.
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:41.460]   You won't die in darkness. You won't die in despair and in hopelessness, whatever your
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:45.980]   gifts and your brilliance. No, no, you'll know in whom you have believed and you'll
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:50.020]   know that he will keep that which you have committed unto him against that day. You'll
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:57.520]   die as the saints have died. You'll be carried and wafted on angels' wings into the presence
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:04.380]   of the eternal God. And you will hear him saying unto you, "Well done, thou good and
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:10.340]   faithful servant. Enter thou in into the joy of the Lord." Yes, you will have so lived
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:16.420]   in this world that as our Lord puts it, that when you come to die, you will be received
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:23.100]   into everlasting habitations. Make to yourselves, friends, with the mammon of unrighteousness,
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:28.060]   that when you fail, that when your life, your health has failed and you die, they may receive
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:36.180]   you into everlasting habitation. You'll die knowing that you're going into one of those
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:41.460]   mansions which your blessed Lord and God has told you he's gone before you to prepare for
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:47.580]   you and which is furnished for you and in which you'll spend a glorious eternity. Oh,
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.220]   if you pay heed to Moses and the prophets and the Son of God, you know when you come
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:57.820]   to die you'll verify Peter's words. You'll have an abundant entry ministered unto you
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:06.460]   into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. That's the way to die
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:12.780]   and to look forward to an eternity of bliss. Very well, let's leave it like this. Make
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:20.500]   this your prayer, the prayer of the saintly Bishop Ken of three hundred years ago. "Teach
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:31.340]   me to live, that I may dread the grave as little as my bed. Teach me to die, that so
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:46.420]   I may rise glorious at the awful day." Make that your prayer. And then join John Sennick,
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:58.580]   a saint of two hundred years ago. So he says, "When e'er in death I slumber, let me rise
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:11.540]   with the wise, counted in their number." Are you among the wise? The wise are those who
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:23.460]   listen to Moses and the prophets, to dielings from hell to the Son of God, our blessed Lord
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:32.580]   and Savior. Are you among them? Have you been persuaded? Have you pressed into the kingdom
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:44.780]   of God? If you haven't, do so now. Make notary and be ye saved. Amen.
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:48.860]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
