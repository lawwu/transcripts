[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.120]   Welcome, everyone, to the 63rd edition
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.640]   of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.080]   Today, we're welcoming back to the program Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.760]   He has written four books on personal finance
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.920]   and four books on economic history.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.000]   Today, we're going to be talking about his current views
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.440]   on the markets and the economy and speaking
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.360]   about his updated book, "The Four Pillars of Investing."
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:44.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.040]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.200]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I am the host
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.760]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.280]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.880]   for Financial Literacy, a nonprofit organization that
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.760]   is building a world of well-informed, capable,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.440]   and empowered investors.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.960]   Visit the Bogle Center at boglecenter.net,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.760]   where you will find a treasure trove of information,
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.800]   including transcripts of these podcasts.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.840]   Before we get started today, I have a couple of items.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.400]   First, I'd like to thank John Luskin for covering for me
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.040]   for five months as I went on a sabbatical up to Alaska.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.840]   My wife and I dragged our camper from Texas for 20,000 miles
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   all the way up through the US Rocky Mountains into Canada,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.080]   through the Canadian Rockies, up to the Alcan Highway,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.640]   to Dawson City in the Yukon, then across the Top of the World
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.600]   Highway over to a little town called Chicken, Alaska,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.000]   and then spent two months touring around in Alaska,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.200]   going everywhere where there were roads.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   And only about 1/4 of Alaska has roads.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.560]   We made it all the way up to the Arctic Ocean
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   and put our feet in the water, got to see the Alaska Pipeline.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.840]   That went all the way up to Pudo Bay
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.680]   and stops at Dead Horse, which is
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920]   where the oil facilities are.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520]   And I have to tell you that it is pristine up there.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.880]   If you have this idea that somehow there's
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   oil leaking all over the place, forget it.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   It is not true.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680]   The oil companies and the government
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.040]   and the Native Americans who own the land
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.240]   do an outstanding job of keeping the environment 100%.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.760]   People have asked me, how was the trip?
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.040]   And the answer is, the beauty of this place
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   is vast, the mountains, the forest, the tundra,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   snowfields, glaciers, thousands of waterfalls
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.280]   and thousands of square miles of wilderness
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.600]   where there are no roads and literally untouched.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   And it's not just Alaska.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.200]   It's the Yukon Territory in Canada,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.920]   Western British Columbia, and the Rocky Mountains in Alberta.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.040]   It's just a beautiful part of the country,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.920]   a beautiful part of the North American continent.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.320]   Anytime you get an opportunity to go up there and take
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.440]   a look around, I definitely recommend it.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.800]   And I also recommend going in the summertime
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.040]   because in the winter, it's 20 to 40 degrees below zero
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.560]   most of the time.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.800]   We got back to my home in Texas at the end of September
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.640]   just in time for the annual Bogleheads Conference that
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.800]   was held in Bethesda, Maryland.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.840]   And this was a huge success.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.160]   It was the largest conference we've ever had.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.560]   There were 510 attendees, 30 fantastic speakers.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.200]   All of the speakers donated their time.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.840]   No one was paid.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.960]   Many people, including some speakers,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.040]   bought tickets and donated them to people
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.600]   who otherwise would not have been able to attend.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.280]   The committee chair this year, as was last year,
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.800]   was Christine Benz, who is also the current president
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.280]   of the Bogle Center.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   And she did a wonderful job.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.960]   To name a few of the speakers, there
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.080]   was Howard Clark, Charlie Ellis, Jerry O'Reilly,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.880]   Vanguard, who is responsible for managing about $4 trillion
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.640]   in equities, including the Vanguard Total Stock Market
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.520]   Index Fund, the largest mutual fund in the world,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.960]   Washington Post columnist Michelle Singletary
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.440]   and her family, Jonathan Clements, and many others,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.640]   including my podcast guest today, Bill Bernstein.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.440]   All of these sessions were recorded.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.560]   YouTube videos will be available soon on boglecenter.net.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.880]   Next fall, around the same time, sometime in October,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.040]   the date is yet to be announced, the conference
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.720]   will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.040]   and I hope to see you all there.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   Our guest today is Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.680]   Bill is not new to the Bogleheads or this podcast.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.960]   He was a guest on this show about four years ago.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.680]   And whenever John Bogle was around Bill,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.040]   it would refer to him as the smartest guy in the room,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.480]   and for good reason.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.160]   Bill holds a PhD and an MD and has had a long career
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.800]   as a neurologist, now retired.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.360]   When he was looking for the best way to invest his own money,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.160]   he became disenchanted with the sales mentality
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.120]   of the financial industry and started a scientific quest
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.560]   into the markets and how they worked.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.400]   That ultimately led Bill to low-cost indexing and Vanguard
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.640]   and co-founding an investment management firm called
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.200]   Efficient Frontier Advisors.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.800]   Bill then began to write.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.520]   First, he had a blog, and then he became a leading author.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.880]   He's written eight books in total, four investment books,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.800]   "The Intelligent Asset Allocator,"
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.080]   "The Four Pillars of Investing," now in its second edition,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.800]   "The Investor's Manifesto," and "Rational Expectations."
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.560]   He's also written four economic history books,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.200]   "The Birth of Plenty," "A Splendid Exchange,"
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.720]   "Masters of the Word," and "The Delusions of Crowds."
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.440]   I will also add that Bill has written several small,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.800]   self-published books.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   Some of them are available for free on Amazon.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.960]   He has also authored and co-authored
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.080]   numerous peer-reviewed articles for financial journals,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.520]   and his work won him the prestigious James R. Verton
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.240]   Award from the CFA Institute in 2017.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.320]   Today, we're going to talk about the past, the present,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.280]   and what the future may hold.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.440]   I remind listeners that the opinions given by Bill
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.600]   are his own.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.640]   Each of us needs to look at our own goals
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.600]   and our own circumstances and determine
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.720]   which strategies and investments are right for us.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.600]   With no further ado, let's welcome Bill Bernstein.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.280]   Welcome to the podcast, Bill.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.280]   I'm glad to be here, Rick.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.240]   Thanks for everything you do for the Bogleheads.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.720]   You were at the last conference.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.320]   You were a big hit at the conference.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.920]   You always are.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.040]   You had a big, long line for people to sign your books.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   You've been going to the Bogleheads' conferences
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.160]   for many, many years.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.560]   Jack Bogle attended almost every one.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.680]   And the only one he couldn't attend,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   because he was in the hospital, he
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.160]   talked to the group from his hospital bed.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.240]   We have a little different agenda now.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.160]   Tell us a little bit about your experience
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160]   at the new conference now that Jack is no longer with us.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.920]   Well, one of the main reasons why I come to the conference
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.360]   is just because the Bogleheads are such nice people.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.920]   It's just a very pleasant experience.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   That really doesn't change with the speakers.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.880]   Now, obviously, everybody was concerned
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.720]   with the passing of Jack that the experience was
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.400]   going to change.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.480]   And of course, it did.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.680]   But thanks to you and to Christine and the big Rolodexes
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.040]   that you have, you were able to acquire
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.680]   some absolutely spectacular speakers and panelists.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.280]   And almost every single one of them knocked it out of the park.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.000]   So it was a very rewarding experience because of that.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Thanks for saying that.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.040]   It was certainly a team effort.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.540]   A lot of people put in a lot of time
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.080]   to put these conferences together.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.520]   And I appreciate your comments on that.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.640]   One of the big items in the conference
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.080]   that seemed to be talked about in almost every session
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   was inflation-protected securities, TIPS.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.040]   And in fact, it was so popular that one of the panels
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.200]   decided that they weren't going to talk about TIPS,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.120]   that it couldn't be mentioned.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.280]   It was banned from the panel.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.960]   That's how much this was mentioned.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.400]   I know that you're a fan of TIPS.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.840]   Could you tell me, number one, why you're a fan
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   and also how one might implement TIPS into their portfolio?
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.520]   Well, because there's no other asset
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.120]   that matches your assets and your liabilities
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.680]   quite so precisely.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.640]   So let's say that you decide that you need $30,000
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   of real spending power in the year 2051, all right?
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.720]   However old you're going to be then,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.520]   you can buy a TIPS that matures in 2031
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.320]   and know exactly how much spending power
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.160]   you're going to have when that bond matures.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.200]   There is no other asset that you can say that about.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.480]   You certainly can't say that about stocks,
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.160]   and you certainly can't say that about nominal bonds either,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.480]   because if there's bad inflation,
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.360]   you're going to see the real value of that nominal bond
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.320]   turn basically into funny money.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.880]   So that's the advantage.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.120]   Now, until about a year and a half ago,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.760]   TIPS weren't a very worthwhile proposition
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.440]   because their yields were so low.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.880]   And in fact, there was a point about two years ago
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.280]   when the yields were strongly negative across the board.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.160]   So if you bought $1,000 worth of TIPS at that point,
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.600]   and they were maturing in 10 or 20 years,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.960]   you were guaranteed to get 80 to 90 cents
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.400]   on the dollar of spending power,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.000]   which didn't seem to be a very good deal.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.280]   Now, real yields are approaching 2.5%.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.800]   So if you buy a 30-year TIPS,
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.080]   you are going to get $2 of spending power in 30 years
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.680]   for every dollar you put in now.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.840]   And that's a heck of a deal.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.520]   That's a near historically high yield.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.360]   - So a lot of different ways to buy TIPS.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.480]   You can buy individual securities.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   You could buy a TIPS fund, short-term or intermediate term.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.960]   Or you could buy this new product
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.400]   that we've been hearing about
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.560]   called iShare Bullet Share TIPS,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.800]   which basically are TIPS put into a portfolio
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   or an ETF that mature in one year.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.480]   And then there's another ETF for TIPS
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.960]   that mature in two years and so forth.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.280]   So you could build this ladder of,
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.600]   instead of individual TIPS, bullet shares.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.880]   How do you feel about these?
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.120]   - Well, the bullet shares, unless I misunderstand them,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.760]   don't make a bit of sense to me.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.520]   Why would you buy one or two bonds
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.760]   that mature in a given year?
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.760]   And I think beyond 2030 or 2032,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.200]   there's only one maturing each year.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.760]   So why would you buy a fund that only owns one bond
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.120]   when you can buy the bond yourself for zero expense?
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.520]   Doesn't make any sense.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.440]   So there's basically two ways
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.400]   to defuse your retirement expenses with TIPS.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.720]   One is simply to buy TIPS that mature
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.400]   in every single year that you're gonna be retired.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.920]   That's not quite possible
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.240]   because there's a gap between 2034 and 2039.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.760]   There are no TIPS that mature then.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   Now you can buy an excess amount of them in 2033 and in 2040,
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.520]   which pretty much does the same trick.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.760]   And of course, you really don't have to own TIPS
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.440]   for all 25 of those years.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.640]   You can skip a couple of years in between the TIPS.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.600]   So you only have to own maybe six or seven or eight of them,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   but that's still a lot of work.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.060]   The other way to do this is to buy a mix of TIPS funds.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.040]   So let's say you think that your retirement
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.160]   is gonna last 30 years.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.960]   Well, you want the average maturity of your TIPS funds
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.840]   to average out to about 15 years, half of that, all right?
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.560]   So you would buy a bit of a 20-year fund,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.480]   and there's only one,
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.280]   and unfortunately that's offered by PIMCO,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.000]   and it's got a 20 basis point expense.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.680]   So that's just a little steep.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.880]   Or, and then you could buy a short-term TIPS fund
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.280]   for a couple of basis points,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.800]   or a couple of ETFs that do that,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.000]   and you mix and match those two,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.080]   and you try and average out,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.800]   weight out the maturities to 15 years.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.760]   And then, of course, you have to rebalance that
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.840]   once every couple of years to keep the maturity right.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.440]   So neither way is perfect.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.560]   Neither way requires a little bit of work.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.800]   I prefer the latter, because that's fire and forget.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.460]   You buy it, you lay it in,
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.840]   and even if you develop the bench up,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.600]   you can tell your executors and your kids,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.640]   "Hey, this is how you pay my expenses
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.600]   "when these TIPS mature."
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.640]   And they don't have to do anything
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   except collect the principal when they mature.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.960]   - Bill, you've recently released a second edition
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.280]   of "The Four Pillars of Investing,"
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.480]   probably one of your best-selling books.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.100]   Could you review for us what those four pillars are?
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.040]   And perhaps, what the most important
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.480]   of the four pillars are?
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.560]   - Well, the four pillars are simply
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.080]   the theory of investing,
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.560]   so the connection between risk and return,
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.680]   and market efficiency, the knowledge
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.960]   that you're not going to be able to trade
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.080]   individual stocks and bonds particularly well,
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.440]   and the trick is not to trade,
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.040]   and you avoid trading by buying passively-managed funds,
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.680]   index funds, whatever you want to call them.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.080]   So that's the first pillar.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.840]   The second pillar is the history,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.380]   and that's probably the most important pillar
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.180]   because markets become ebullient
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.900]   and euphoric from time to time,
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.680]   and markets, more importantly,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.460]   become panicky from time to time.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.580]   And it's important to know what that looks like,
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.060]   not necessarily so you can time the market
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.300]   because that's nearly impossible to do.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.020]   You do that simply so you can keep your discipline
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.020]   and stay the course and say to yourself,
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.200]   "Yeah, you know, I've seen this movie before,
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.380]   "and I know how it ends,
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.180]   "either on the upside and the downside."
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.500]   The third pillar is your own psychology.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.260]   The problem with human beings is we didn't evolve
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:22.060]   to deal with a 40- or a 50-year planning horizon.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.500]   We evolved on the plains of the Serengeti
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.980]   dealing with a time horizon or a risk horizon
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.220]   that was measured sometimes in seconds,
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.580]   and so we are psychologically ill-equipped
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.260]   to deal with the long-term risks and returns
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.280]   that are involved with finance.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.500]   So learning how to handle that is the third pillar.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.100]   It's very important.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.260]   And then finally, you have to learn how to deal
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.580]   with the financial services industry,
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.580]   which in many cases is the metaphorical equivalent
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.460]   of a war zone.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.660]   There are people out there who are out to get you
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.980]   and transfer your wealth from your name to theirs,
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.540]   and you have to know how to deal
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.220]   with those people and those institutions.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.580]   - In your book, you get into a detail
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.980]   about the equity risk premium,
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.660]   and this is the excess return for taking the risk
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.440]   in the stock market over the risk-free rate.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.460]   And I'm assuming in your book,
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.340]   you're using T-bills as the risk-free rate?
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.920]   - Yeah, that's the classic one.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.280]   You can also use longer bonds and especially TIPS
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.460]   as a risk-free rate as well,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.180]   but most people use the 30-day Treasury bill.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.880]   - And given that 30-day Treasury bills
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   currently are yielding 5.3% at the moment,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   what would you suppose the equity risk premium is over that,
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.780]   say, over the next 20 or 30 years?
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.580]   - Well, you can calculate out
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.660]   what the expected return of stocks is,
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.780]   and you can also look at historical returns.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.120]   And you can not only look in the United States,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.940]   which is the winner, or just about the winner
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.700]   of all the 20 or 30 nations
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.620]   that we have long-term records for,
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.540]   and the equity risk premium seems to be,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.580]   no matter how you look at it,
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.300]   either historically or calculated,
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.220]   somewhere in the vicinity of 4%,
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.500]   might be 3%, might be 5%.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.340]   So if T-bills are yielding 5%,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.140]   maybe you should expect perhaps 8% from stocks.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.700]   Now, the problem with using the T-bill
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.740]   is that it's yielding 5.3% right now.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.460]   I'm willing to bet that it won't be yielding
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.620]   that much three or four years from now.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.620]   And so that may be an overestimate.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.660]   A better estimate might be to think in real terms
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.220]   and say that, yeah, there's a 2.5% tips yield across,
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.180]   real tips yield across the yield curve.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.180]   So maybe you should expect 5.5% or 6.5% real return
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.700]   from stocks, not nominal return,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.840]   but after inflation return from stocks.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.500]   - So if you were looking, say, for 5.5% to 6.5%
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.100]   real return from stocks,
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.900]   and you can get risk-free 2.5 in tips,
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.460]   then you're really talking a 2% to maybe 3%
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.460]   equity risk premium over real interest rates today?
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.260]   - Yeah, I'm saying 4%, in other words, 6.5% for bonds
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.500]   and tips and maybe 6.5% for stocks.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.240]   So 6.5%, if it was 2.5% inflation, that's 9% nominal.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.880]   - Oh, okay, so it's actually quite high.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.020]   - Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.700]   And one of the things that people kept asking me
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.220]   two years ago was, what do I do about low yields?
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.620]   And the answer is, you've got a great big loaded portfolio
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.060]   because yields are so low.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.420]   Because when yields are low, asset prices rise.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.900]   So be careful what you wish for.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.540]   If you ever do get to the point
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.700]   where you have much higher yields,
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.880]   your portfolio is going to be considerably smaller,
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.860]   especially on an inflation-adjusted basis,
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.620]   indeed, which it is, okay?
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.260]   Stocks are down from where they were two years ago,
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.660]   and bonds, depending upon your duration,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.100]   have gotten absolutely creamed over the past two years.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.700]   I think the long treasury, the 30-year treasury,
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.140]   is down about half from where it was two years ago.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:16.140]   - So let's talk about life in a 5% yield world.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.620]   Some people would argue that stocks have not yet adjusted
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.620]   for a 5% yield on, say, the 10-year treasury.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.860]   And real estate has not yet adjusted for this higher,
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.300]   for longer interest rate environment.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.420]   - Well, that's certainly a possibility.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.260]   But I also believe that the markets,
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.220]   the overwhelming majority of the time, are very efficient,
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.260]   and they reflect the proper level of prices.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.860]   And I'm not willing to bet very often
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.980]   that the market is wrong about valuations
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.340]   and expected returns.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.580]   And I'm certainly not willing to bet that right now.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.420]   Now, the one thing that I think needs to be pointed out
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   is that U.S. large-cap stocks are trading at multiples
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.140]   that are historically significantly higher than they have.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.220]   So maybe their expected returns are lower.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.220]   But there are other asset classes, equity asset classes,
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.340]   that are very reasonably priced.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.620]   Small-value stocks are very reasonably priced right now.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.660]   Foreign stocks are very reasonably priced.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.380]   Emerging market stocks are very reasonably priced.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.620]   And even real estate stocks,
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.620]   which have taken some real losses over the past year or so,
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.300]   are not unreasonably priced as well.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.340]   So I think if you look beyond the S&P 500,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.220]   I think that there are very reasonable places
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.180]   to get decent expected returns.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.740]   And when you talk about expected returns,
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.180]   you have to realize there are very large error bars.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.060]   You know, when I say 6.5%,
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.500]   when anybody says that there's a 6.5% expected return
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.460]   on stocks, over the next 30 years,
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.660]   it's quite possible we'll see a negative return,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.660]   a negative real return,
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.900]   and it's quite possible we'll see an 11% real return.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.060]   You just don't know.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.780]   The best you can do is go with the central estimate.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.940]   - There's been a lot of media bashing
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.020]   of the classic 60/40 portfolio,
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.900]   60% in equity, 40% in fixed income.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.540]   There was an article in the Wall Street Journal
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.380]   the other day that talked about how this
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.860]   had the worst year it's had in decades.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.180]   And some people, primarily active managers,
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.700]   talk about how the 60/40 portfolio
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.300]   is not the right portfolio for today's environment.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   What's your take on it?
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.940]   - The person who wrote that article
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.380]   should wear a sandwich board that announces
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.020]   that they have risk aversion myopia.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.100]   Because something has a bad return over a one-year period
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.260]   doesn't mean that it's a bad strategy.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.460]   The 60/40 stock mine portfolio
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.540]   is a superb long-term investment strategy.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.220]   And simply because it has a bad year
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.660]   is absolutely no reason to abandon it.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.740]   In fact, one of the things that separates out
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.100]   the wheat from the chaff, if I can be sexist,
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.220]   the men from the boys or the women from the girls,
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:14.220]   if you will, in investing is how they respond
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.460]   to a bad year for their strategy.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.140]   All strategies are gonna have bad years.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.140]   And 2022 was a bad year for the 60/40 portfolio.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.020]   But it was a superb 30 years.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.860]   - And normally I tell people that the idea
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.860]   that a 60/40 portfolio will prevent a loss is wrong.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.260]   That's never been what people have said
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.820]   about a 60/40 portfolio.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.660]   They say that it reduces the probability of a large loss,
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.620]   but it doesn't eliminate the probability
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.460]   of a large loss.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.820]   And I think that last year we saw that.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.220]   Stay the course then with a 60/40 portfolio
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.580]   if you have one.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.540]   - Yeah, you shouldn't give a rat's patootie
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.340]   about a bad year every now and then.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.660]   What you care about is how you've done
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.900]   over the past 30 years.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.700]   - There's a lot of terminology out there
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.100]   in the investment world that to me,
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.860]   I think is designed to confuse investors
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.460]   rather than help them.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.100]   And one of them is called optimization.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.660]   This idea that you can look back in history
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.180]   and look back at the markets historically,
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.380]   and you can optimize your portfolio
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.540]   with the correct percentages in each asset class
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.860]   so that going forward you have an optimal portfolio.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:36.100]   How realistic is optimization going for looking forward?
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.940]   - It's beyond being impossible.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.220]   It's almost a cruel joke.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.700]   Probably the worst way to design a portfolio
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.540]   is to look at what's done the best,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.780]   what asset allocation has done the best in the past,
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.060]   and then mimic that going forward.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.140]   Warren Buffett, I think, very famously said
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:05.140]   that if you could get to future optimal portfolios
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.980]   from past results, then librarians
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.780]   would be the world's richest people.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.140]   - There's another tool out there
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.300]   that's used by advisors a lot,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.220]   and it creates a lot of squiggly lines on paper
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.820]   and puts a line through the middle of it all.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.420]   It's called Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:32.140]   And I'm skeptical on whether advisors
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.540]   should be using Monte Carlo simulations
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.340]   to determine the 5% probability
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.220]   that the clients will be living under a bridge
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.860]   and eating dog food.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.260]   How do you feel about use or overuse
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.140]   of things like Monte Carlo simulation
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.260]   to determine what might be, again,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.460]   an optimal portfolio for retirement?
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.460]   - Well, I would never use Monte Carlo simulations for that.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.100]   What I would use them for is to try
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.420]   and get some sense of a probability
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.180]   of how likely you are to leave a request
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.100]   or, on the opposite end, how likely you are
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.540]   to run out of money.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.220]   And even then, it's not a terribly useful tool.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:19.540]   Financial economists have physics envy.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.980]   They want to reduce financial systems
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.820]   to the accuracy and the precision
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.500]   of an airfoil or an electrical current,
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.740]   an electrical circuit.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.700]   And you can't do that, all right?
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.060]   It's just an impossible thing to do.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.860]   The systems are too dirty.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.900]   Now, my favorite sort of hobby horse
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.300]   is when somebody looks at a Monte Carlo simulation
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.220]   and says that the odds of portfolio success
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.220]   are 95% or 98%, so there's a 2% or 5% chance of failure.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.820]   Well, heck, if you look at human history
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.380]   over the past couple of millennia,
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.340]   you see that societies usually don't survive
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.660]   for more than 500 years.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   So if you have an 80-year lifespan,
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.860]   it means you have about a one in six chance
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.420]   of living through a catastrophic situation
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   that is going to completely destroy your savings.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.980]   So no one, no one in this quadrant of the galaxy
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.020]   can be guaranteed a 95% or 98% chance of success
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.980]   for simple historical reasons.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.580]   There's really only one truism,
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.860]   which is that the more you save and the less you spend,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.380]   the safer you're going to be,
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.380]   and you really can't say much beyond that.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.860]   - You have several other small books that you wrote
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.020]   in addition to the eight big books, if you will.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.300]   In fact, some of them are free on Amazon.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.220]   People can download for free.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.940]   One of these books that you wrote was called "Deep Risk,
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.580]   "How History Informs Portfolio Design."
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.100]   What did you mean by deep risk?
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.180]   - Well, to know what deep risk is,
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.580]   you have to know what shallow risk is.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.500]   Shallow risk is the risk that everybody thinks about, okay?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.340]   It's having a bad year.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.460]   It's 2022.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.780]   It's having a bad day.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.900]   For example, you know, October 19th, 1987,
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.460]   when the markets lost almost a quarter of their value.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.380]   That's shallow risk.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.420]   Shallow risk almost always recovers,
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.740]   and that's not a risk that is going to get you.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.060]   The risk that is going to get you as an investor
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.220]   is a prolonged period,
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.020]   lasting perhaps a generation of negative real returns,
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.580]   'cause that's the sort of thing
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.460]   that can absolutely blast your retirement to smithereens.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.140]   So let me give you an example of deep risk.
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.700]   Deep risk is the Japanese stock market
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.980]   over the past 33 years,
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.660]   which has lost something like 2/3 of its value
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.420]   in inflation-adjusted terms.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.580]   A Japanese investor who depended on stocks
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.460]   for retirement beginning in 1990
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.460]   was probably eating cat food within 10 or 15 years.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.300]   That's deep risk.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.020]   Deep risk is what happened to bonds,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.100]   U.S. bonds, between 1940 and 1980.
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.820]   Again, they lost, even with reinvested interest,
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.980]   about 2/3 or at least 60% of their value.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.740]   That's enough to, you know,
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.940]   destroy anybody's retirement plans.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.620]   And so what are the things that cause deep risk?
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.300]   It's not having a bad day or a bad year in the stock market.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.980]   The things that cause deep risk
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.500]   are first and foremost, inflation, all right?
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.740]   So when you look at financial history,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.140]   inflation is almost endemic.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.140]   It is rare to see a nation
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.300]   that avoids hyperinflation at any point.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.180]   We've more or less avoided it,
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.780]   although the '70s were a rough patch.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.220]   The Swiss have avoided it, the Dutch avoided it.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.220]   Very few other nations do that, avoid severe inflation.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.140]   That's the most common deep risk,
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.020]   and it's also the one that is the easiest to mitigate,
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:04.860]   all right?
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.020]   And we'll talk about, perhaps,
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.820]   how to mitigate that in a minute.
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.580]   The next risk is deflation.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.020]   Deflation is extremely rare, and it's easily curable.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.380]   Printing presses, governments have printing presses,
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.980]   or at least, unless you're in the EU, you do.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.140]   And so it's relatively easy to avoid deflation.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.580]   Deflation rarely lasts a very long period of time.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.540]   There's confiscation,
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.220]   the government coming and taking your assets,
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.540]   either through excessive taxation
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.700]   or through downright confiscation,
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.020]   as happened in the communist countries
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.940]   after their revolutions.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.460]   And then finally, the fourth risk is destruction,
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.780]   which is more a civil disorder.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.620]   So to take them in order,
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.820]   inflation is the one you can do the most about.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.780]   Deflation is rare.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.500]   You probably don't have to worry about it.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.380]   Confiscation, you know, you have to flee the country,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.140]   which is not an easy thing to do.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.980]   And destruction, beyond, you know,
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   having a good supply of canned goods and ammo,
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.980]   there's not a lot you can do about it.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   And even if you have the canned goods and the ammo,
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.740]   you may not be able to do anything about it.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.380]   So the rational investor,
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.540]   I came to the conclusion in that book,
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.820]   tries to do the best that they can to mitigate inflation.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.980]   - So here we are at a point in history
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.340]   where we have a $33 trillion national debt
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.340]   continue to rack up trillion dollars a year in excess debt.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.860]   No end in sight for this.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.340]   The only way we could possibly begin to pay this back
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.220]   is through some sort of confiscation.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.060]   We have to pay more taxes.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.740]   Would you agree with that?
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.860]   - Gosh, you did a really good job of channeling Ron Paul.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.420]   - Okay.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.540]   - How do you mitigate that, all right,
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.220]   if you're really worried about that risk?
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.700]   And there's several different strategies,
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.380]   which you can apply simultaneously.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.100]   Number one is in the long-term,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.820]   equities are not a bad hedge against inflation,
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.940]   not a perfect hedge against inflation.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.140]   But when you look outside of the U.S.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.700]   at the nations that have had the very worst inflation,
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.700]   places like Chile, places like Israel, even Weimar, Germany,
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.700]   stocks actually held up pretty well
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.500]   throughout those severe inflations.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.340]   Why?
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.260]   Because stocks are a claim on real assets.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.220]   They produce products that can be priced
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.060]   according to inflation.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.380]   And in real currency,
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.740]   they have real assets that they can sell.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.860]   So they're not a bad way to do that.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.500]   Now, there are some kinds of stocks
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.500]   that do especially well with inflation.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.980]   One of them is value stocks.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.380]   Value stocks tend to be over leveraged,
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.060]   and that leverage melts away
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.380]   and goes straight to the bottom line with inflation.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.500]   Commodities producing stocks do well.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.380]   I'm not a big fan of owning commodities
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.020]   or commodities futures,
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.700]   but oil stocks, gold stocks, base metals producers
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.580]   all do very well with inflation.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.100]   We've already talked about tips.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.340]   Tips, by definition, are going to do well with inflation.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.060]   The one asset class, interestingly,
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.180]   that really doesn't do that well with inflation
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.660]   when you look at it through a broad enough lens is gold.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.900]   Gold did pretty well in the U.S. in the '70s with inflation,
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.940]   but in any other period in any other country
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.460]   that had severe inflation, it didn't do that well.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.660]   And in fact, curiously, paradoxically,
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.660]   gold does best with deflation.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.100]   And the reason for that, if you think about it,
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.020]   is fairly obvious, which is that financial panics,
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.740]   when people lose faith in the financial system,
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.620]   tend to be deflationary.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.940]   And it's not that gold does well with deflation per se,
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.820]   but gold does well with financial panics,
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.260]   and financial panics tend to be deflationary.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.740]   - Notice that during the COVID crisis
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.460]   that the price of gold went up significantly
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.140]   when that began.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.380]   And then once we had the recovery from that
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.140]   and inflation started coming back,
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.860]   the price of gold did not continue up
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.860]   because it had already gone up.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.620]   So just recently, your theory about gold is correct.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.060]   Let's get onto another topic.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.980]   You were speaking with Meb Faber recently on a podcast,
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.820]   and he was asking you what you thought
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.500]   you might start working on next.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.420]   And one of the answers that you gave to him was
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.020]   you were very interested in why some countries
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.620]   became wealthy and some countries did not.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.860]   What was the key factor of what you found
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.940]   in this research so far as to why some countries
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.740]   gain wealth and others do not?
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.340]   - Well, the question is why have the Northern Europeans
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.220]   done so well economically?
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.620]   And why, by the way, have their securities markets
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.180]   done generally much better than other countries?
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.660]   You know, when you look at the highest
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.660]   returning equity markets around the world
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.860]   in the past century and a quarter,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.140]   you're looking at, you know, the United States,
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.820]   the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.500]   all being at or near the top of the list.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.340]   Sweden and Switzerland have also done well.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.500]   And what characterizes those countries?
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.060]   Well, it's, you know, the usual things,
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.980]   rule of law, independence of judiciary,
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.980]   but also it's what sociologists call radius of trust, okay?
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.500]   In other words, if, you know, you drop your wallet
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.540]   in the park or on the street,
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.580]   what are the odds of you getting it back?
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.660]   And it turns out that some cultures
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:37.660]   have a higher radius of trust than other cultures do.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.020]   And the reasons for that are well beyond
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:45.020]   the ambit of this podcast.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.060]   But it has to do with culture.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.860]   And the other really interesting thing
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.900]   is it has to do with marriage proscriptions
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.420]   in Northern European countries.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.220]   Because if you can't, you know,
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.820]   you can't marry your second or third or fourth cousin,
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.220]   it means that you have to leave the town
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.420]   that you were born to find a mate,
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.820]   as a lot of English people and Northern Europeans
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.020]   had to do at one point or another.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.780]   And when you do that, you learn to trust other people,
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.220]   not just the people in your family and your clan.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.980]   And that, you know, follows through
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.860]   in terms of economic growth.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.220]   The higher the radius of trust,
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.060]   the longer the radius of trust in society,
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.380]   the more prosperous it is.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.900]   I don't know that I'm gonna get to write that book,
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.100]   but it would be a fun book to write.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.860]   - One of the things that you mentioned
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.460]   was things that break up that trust.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:41.060]   You know, what causes that trust to erode over time?
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.100]   - Well, that's another interesting subject,
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.140]   and that would be the second part of the book,
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   which is that societies that do become prosperous and stable
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:55.500]   tend also to acquire layers of special interests
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.180]   that tend to choke off the economy.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.220]   So all you have to do in this country
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.380]   is look at the power of the medical-industrial complex
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.780]   that is resistant to any change or reform.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.220]   And you see that we're spending
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.580]   close to 20% of our GDP on medical care,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.180]   and yet our healthcare statistics are,
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.700]   if anything, a little worse than they are
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.300]   in countries that have, where the medical-industrial complex
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.940]   isn't quite as powerful.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.940]   If you're an American diabetic,
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.820]   you are three times more likely to get an amputation
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.500]   as an English diabetic will,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.420]   simply because our medical system is so dysfunctional.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.380]   You know, you can also look
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.540]   at the military-industrial complex,
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.580]   and you can look at congressional privilege as well.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.260]   One of the reasons why the Congress
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.100]   is so currently dysfunctional simply has to do
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.380]   with the capture of special interests
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.700]   of the legislative process.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.500]   - One of the other things you mentioned
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   is that as a country becomes wealthier,
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.340]   or the wealthier that society gets,
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.180]   there becomes more inequality,
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.580]   and that also leads to distrust.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.260]   - Yeah, and we're seeing that right now.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.860]   I mean, half of the people in this country,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.140]   the United States, couldn't come up with $400
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.420]   for a car repair without going into debt.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.660]   And that's the sort of, again,
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.180]   that's the sort of inequality that you see
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.500]   when special interests gain power.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.060]   I mean, if you're a hedge fund,
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.020]   billionaire hedge fund manager,
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.460]   you're liable to have a marginal tax rate
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.900]   that is lower than legal secretaries.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:42.380]   - You wrote a paper called "The Myth of Dynastic Wealth,
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.820]   "The Rich Get Poorer,"
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.980]   and the co-authors were Rob Barnett and Lillian Wu.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.900]   Within society, people seem to wanna target
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.100]   very wealthy people.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.380]   The rich don't pay enough in taxes,
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.580]   and they need to pay their fair share, and so forth,
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.300]   as if families are accumulating wealth,
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.900]   and that wealth will never go away.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.220]   But in fact, I'd like you to talk about this paper.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.340]   You wrote it some time ago, but I found it fascinating
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.220]   that wealth doesn't really stay with the same people
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.620]   generation after generation.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.740]   It gets dispersed like sandcastles on a beach
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.260]   getting washed back out to the ocean after a few tides.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.700]   - The paper looks over a time period
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.740]   that is not just a generation or two in length,
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.620]   but over several generations.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.860]   So the classic example of that is the Vanderbilt family.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:40.420]   There was a get-together of the Vanderbilts in 1970,
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.540]   and there was not one millionaire in the group,
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.300]   and how did that happen?
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.340]   So over the very long term,
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.420]   you're looking at centuries now,
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.860]   wealth tends to migrate out of the wealthiest families,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.340]   and the reason is just, it's just simple exponential math.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.300]   I mean, a very wealthy couple is going to have two children
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:06.260]   and four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren,
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.500]   and by the time you get to the sixth or seventh generation,
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.580]   there just isn't enough wealth to go around,
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.220]   particularly as the successive generations
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.940]   get lazier and softer and tend to blow the money
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.860]   and sue each other over their inheritances.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.460]   So over very long periods of time,
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.860]   their wealth does dissipate.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.540]   We don't have any real dynastic wealth in this country.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.420]   There are no families whose wealth goes back
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.620]   to the time of the Revolution,
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.940]   and very few families whose wealth goes back
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.180]   to, say, the time of the Civil War.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.060]   Now, that said, there is enormous inequality
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.380]   from generation to generation.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.340]   Perhaps I'm getting a little too political here.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.940]   Whenever people complain about affirmative action,
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.980]   I remind them what affirmative action really looks like.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.100]   Affirmative action is when your father
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.580]   is an investment banker and your mother is a radiologist
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.780]   and you've taken 14 advanced placement courses
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.460]   by the time you're in 11th grade or 12th grade, all right?
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.740]   And that's what real affirmative action looks like.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.780]   And so from, you know, over one or two generations,
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.540]   we have real inequality
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.100]   and we have real lack of social mobility.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.460]   But the one thing we don't have, and that's a real problem,
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.780]   the one thing we don't have to worry about, I think,
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.900]   is one or two families taking over the wealth
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.940]   of the entire country.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.860]   That's not going to happen
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.260]   because that wealth does tend to dissipate
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.900]   over very long periods of time.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.020]   But over periods of less than, say, 50 years or 60 years,
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.580]   I do worry about it.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.500]   - Well, one of the things we have in this country
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.500]   is an estate tax to take 40% of wealth over,
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.620]   call it 25 million for a married couple.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.180]   And basically the government takes it
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.820]   unless you give it to charity.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.940]   So that also puts the money back into the system.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.940]   It puts it back into other people's hands.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.500]   And again, I always like to think of it as sandcastles
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.780]   that wash out to the sea over time.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.620]   - I agree with you.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.780]   I don't think we have to worry, you know,
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.260]   that 200 years Elon Musk's kids
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.460]   are going to be running the country.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.300]   That's not the worry.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.140]   The worry that I have
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.500]   are the short-term effects of inequality.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.020]   I worry, for example, that in the United States,
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.300]   if you were born in the bottom quintile
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.940]   of socioeconomic status or wealth or income,
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.020]   the odds of you making it to the top quintile,
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.580]   from the bottom 20% to the top 20%,
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.620]   are about 5% or 6%, all right?
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.660]   Whereas in a perfectly mobile society, it should be 20%.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.100]   Now in Scandinavia, Northern Europe, that's about 14%.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.420]   In Arkansas, it's about 3% or 4%.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.340]   In Silicon Valley, it's about 13%.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.980]   It's almost, it's about at a European level.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.460]   So I worry about our lack of social mobility,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.780]   which is due to wealth inequality.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.420]   - And is this all going to be the subject of a book?
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.260]   - Probably not.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.380]   Other people have written about it far more eloquently
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.220]   than I'm ever going to be able to.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.420]   The person who I pay attention to is Raj Chetty,
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.020]   who's at Harvard University, who's an economist.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.220]   And Angus Deaton has written a very fine book
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.340]   on the subject.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.940]   He's actually written two books.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.700]   One is "Death of Despair," which touches on it.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.220]   And the other is his more recent book,
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.660]   which is "Economics in America,"
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.580]   which is basically a biography,
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.580]   but he touches on a lot of these selfsame subjects.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.700]   And he's well worth reading
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.380]   if you really want a deep dive into the issue.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.740]   - I have one last question for you,
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.140]   and I'm doing it on behalf of Jonathan Clements,
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.580]   because he interviewed you at the conference
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.060]   and he did not get to ask this question
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.580]   because there were so many other questions.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.660]   So I'm going to ask it on his behalf.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.060]   You just jumped into an Uber.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:49.220]   The driver is clearly both intelligent
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:53.020]   and uninformed about personal finance.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.540]   He finds out that you're an expert in personal finance,
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.740]   and he asks you for advice.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.620]   You have time to make five points
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.780]   before you get to your destination.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.220]   What would you recommend to this Uber driver?
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.940]   - Well, I knew what those five points were a week ago
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.260]   when I was prepared for Jonathan to ask me that question.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.100]   I'll do my best to recall five,
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.900]   but I may only get through the four.
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:23.900]   The first one is to save 15% of your before-tax salary,
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.660]   if you at all can.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.220]   And the second is to keep your expenditures down.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.380]   The third is to not trade stocks and bonds,
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.020]   to invest passively.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.260]   When you trade stocks and bonds,
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.660]   to imagine that you're playing tennis
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.380]   against an invisible opponent, all right?
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.780]   And to realize that the person on the other side of the net
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.220]   isn't some dentist from Peoria
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.780]   who was put there for you to trade with and make you rich.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.420]   That the person on the other side of the net
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.740]   more likely is Serena Williams
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.420]   or the investment partner of Serena Williams.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.380]   The fourth thing that I would tell
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.740]   my metaphorical Uber driver
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.860]   is to ignore your friends and family
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.500]   because almost invariably,
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.460]   they're going to give you poor advice
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.420]   to stick to more reliable sources of information.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.420]   And then the fifth thing is to avoid the headlines.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.420]   The headlines are very useful.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.060]   The economic headlines are very useful
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.980]   because if it's above the fold, if it's in the headline,
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.100]   it's already been impounded into the price.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.940]   So it's worthless information.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.220]   And if something's, in other words,
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.140]   if something is in a headline,
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.620]   then you don't have to worry about it
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.780]   because the prices have already reflected that.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.260]   So I think I got five things.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.500]   - You did.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.540]   And I would say that the headlines are interesting
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.660]   because today, as I was reading the Wall Street Journal,
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.860]   the headlines were individual stock investors
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.460]   outperformed the market.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.380]   I don't know if you caught that story or not,
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.740]   but it went in there and it talked about
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.420]   how many people own Apple stock and Google
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.620]   and Amazon in their own accounts
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.860]   and how they have outperformed.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.500]   Now, I review literally hundreds of portfolios
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.380]   for individual clients every year.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.060]   And I have to tell you, I have not seen this,
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.740]   but apparently the Wall Street Journal has.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.260]   Did you read that article?
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.580]   - I saw the article and they quoted a research outfit
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.420]   that I have never heard of before.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.700]   And we both are fairly familiar
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.900]   with the finance literature.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.260]   There are literally hundreds of studies
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.860]   that show just how poorly individual investors do,
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.060]   whether they invest in individual stocks or mutual funds,
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.140]   they almost always underperform.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.460]   And they underperform in direct proportion
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.180]   to how frequently they trade.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.620]   So the fact that somebody somewhere
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.820]   came up with a study that shows the opposite,
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.340]   I would not just take a pinch of salt
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.620]   or even a thimbleful of salt,
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.580]   I would want a bucket of salt with that study.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.780]   (laughs)
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.220]   - Well, thank you so much again
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.900]   for joining us on Bogle Heads On Investing.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.820]   Your insights are always interesting.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.780]   I have to go back and listen to this three or four times
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.780]   so I catch everything that you say.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.860]   And thank you again also for speaking
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.340]   at the Bogle Heads conference
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.740]   and hope to see you there next year.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.900]   - Rick, I hope to see you next year
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.100]   and I look forward to doing this again with you.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:14.180]   - This concludes this episode of Bogle Heads On Investing.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.940]   Join us each month as we interview a new guest
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:17.980]   on a new topic.
