[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   When I was in medical school, we had a, and I think I even write about this in the book,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.820]   we had a pathology lecture where the professor stands up there and he says, "What is the
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.760]   most common presentation of a heart attack?"
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.680]   And you know, us keener first-year med students, hands shoot straight up.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.680]   Chest pain.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.560]   No, that's not the most common.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.280]   Oh, shoulder pain.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.760]   Arm radiating down the left arm.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.760]   No.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760]   Shortness of breath.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   No, no, no.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.080]   We rattled this off for a few minutes, and he goes, "Death."
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.200]   The single most common presentation for a myocardial infarction is death.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   More people...
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.400]   Now, I would say today, that was 25 years ago, today it's probably not the most common
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.320]   because advanced cardiac life support is so much better, but it's still strikingly common.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320]   So...
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   Well, you could say that the best predictor of a heart attack is still a heart attack.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.160]   This is just one of those things where we're going to spend a lot of time talking about
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.760]   things that feel good and feel bad when you change them, right?
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.160]   Like if you take a person who's not sleeping well, but who thinks they're sleeping well,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.000]   and you ask them for a leap of faith, which is, "Hey, give me a month to help you sleep
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   really well."
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.680]   Yeah, you're going to feel better.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.800]   You might not know it now because you don't know how bad you're sleeping now.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400]   You've become acclimated to this.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.360]   But this is not one of those domains, exercise, nutrition, sleep, all those things.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.240]   When you do those things better, you feel better.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.040]   But I don't want to over-promise on this.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.360]   You're not going to feel better in the moment when you fix your lipids, but you'll feel
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.720]   better when you don't have a heart attack.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.880]   So by all this logic, everybody should get their ApoB measured.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.840]   How early in life should people do that, starting in their 20s, in their 30s?
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.600]   Only if you have a family history that is of any concern.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.720]   If I could live my life over again, if I knew everything then that I know today, yeah, I
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.640]   would have had mine measured in my 20s.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.360]   I didn't get my ApoB measured for the first time probably until I was in my 40s because
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.040]   that's, well, yeah, maybe late 30s, early 40s, right?
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.360]   I had my first calcium scan when I was 35 and I had to beg, borrow, steal to get it
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.120]   done because everyone was like, why does a 35 year old want to do this?
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.880]   But I something, I just felt something was wrong given my family history and I'm glad
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   I did.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.320]   I'm glad I did that because I learned something that, that completely changed the direction
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   of my life.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   Okay.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.040]   I know my ApoB numbers and that I might be that guy who's up in the, you know, above
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   a hundred.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   So I'm going to get this treated.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400]   That's a promise to myself.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.760]   We covered the three major risk factors, which were blood pressure, keeping that in check,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   don't smoke and ApoB.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.480]   And we've now talked about the things to adjust ApoB levels.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.240]   We did not really talk about things to adjust blood pressure.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.920]   I'm assuming exercise sits as one of the foremost.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.360]   Exercise, nutrition, yeah.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.120]   Weight management is a huge one here.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.200]   So you know, you take a person who's blood, and this is one of those things where we don't
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.560]   immediately jump on the pharmacotherapy train with blood pressure, because here there are
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.640]   side effects sometimes.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.560]   And you do have to worry about overshooting.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.200]   You don't really have to worry about overshooting a person's lipids.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.760]   We do back off if we overshoot, but it doesn't cause a symptom.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.080]   There's not a, there's not a short-term immediate risk from doing that.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.560]   If you overshoot somebody's blood pressure medication, you trade one problem for another
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   problem.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.880]   They become lightheaded when they get up to pee at night, they fall and bang their head.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.600]   That's a devastating consequence, totally unacceptable.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.120]   So our goal is to see how much we can lower blood pressure without medication before we
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.360]   turn to medication.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.560]   And let's be clear, the meds today are so much better than they used to be.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.240]   Again, there was a day when the side effects of these medicines were miserable.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   That's simply not the case today.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.360]   I mean, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, I mean, these things are very well
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.920]   tolerated, especially the ARBs.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.840]   So again, almost anybody can be on these things.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.440]   But if we could get a person to lose 10 pounds and exercise every day, we see great effects
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.640]   with zone two stuff, right?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.200]   So kind of the low intensity cardio.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.840]   What's, and your recommendation there, I know you talk about this in the book, but are we,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   I've thrown out numbers about 150 to 180 minutes per week.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   You go a bit higher.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.760]   Yeah, we go 180 to 250, 240.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.120]   Yeah, I'd like to see three to four hours a week of zone two.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.680]   So that's an important piece and sleep is an important piece.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.440]   So get the sleep right, get the exercise right.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.360]   If you're overnourished, let's correct that problem.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.080]   And if all of that doesn't work, and by the way, that works a lot of the time, that works
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   most of the time.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.160]   If that doesn't work, then we've got pharmacotherapy.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.720]   There is still a true phenomenon of essential hypertension, which is in individuals for
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.260]   whom all the fixable stuff has been fixed and they still have high blood pressure.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.380]   We still have to medicate those folks.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.640]   By the way, there's something that I want to mention here that doesn't get much attention,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.160]   but it's so important, which is the effect of high blood pressure on the kidney and also
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   the brain itself.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.480]   We've talked about the brain, we've talked about the heart, but the kidney doesn't get
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.040]   enough attention.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.480]   The kidney is a remarkable organ.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.200]   And I think if you're really in this game of trying to live longer, right?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.920]   If you think, hey, you know, maybe we'll live 80, 85 years, but if we kind of start doing
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.240]   all of these other things and really optimizing our behaviors, that could be 95.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.240]   Well, you have to start thinking about the capacity of the kidney.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.880]   And once the glomerular filtration rate falls below a certain level, you have to be very
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.560]   careful with how you live your life.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.280]   And unfortunately, this is one of those things that is another sort of mistake that's made
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.000]   in kind of modern medicine, which is we don't pay enough attention to how to measure kidney
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   function correctly.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.660]   We rely very heavily on something called creatinine as opposed to looking at another biomarker
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.260]   called cystatin C, which is far more accurate.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.820]   And we also tolerate too low of a kidney function for a person's age.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.200]   So we look at, you know, we might look at someone who's 50, whose kidney function is
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.940]   at 65% and say, you're totally fine.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.040]   Because it's true that at 65% there is no problem.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.880]   But you're not thinking, well, if this person has to live another 40 years and this continues
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.080]   to go down, they're going to potentially be staring down the barrel of needing dialysis
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.960]   the last five years of their life.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.160]   Again, you want to die with compromised kidney function, but never from compromised kidney
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   function.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.040]   In fact, the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality associated with compromised kidney function
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.440]   is even greater than that of heart disease.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   Once you cross that threshold, I mean, lights out.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.480]   Once you are needing dialysis, I mean, your risk of death is higher than that of someone
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.920]   with high blood pressure, smoking, even someone who has cancer.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.960]   You have a higher risk of death having end-stage renal disease than you do having cancer.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.800]   So the kidney is so sensitive to blood pressure.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:17.400]   This is a tiny organ that on every pump of your heart is getting 20% to 25% of your blood.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.240]   So just imagine how sensitive and susceptible it is to elevated blood pressure.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
