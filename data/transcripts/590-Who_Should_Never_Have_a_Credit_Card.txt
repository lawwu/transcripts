[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.320]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.760]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.760]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.800]   I am your host, and today we continue our credit card week here on Radical Personal
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.800]   Finance with a discussion on who should not have credit cards.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.880]   All this week and last week, I have been focused on the topic of credit cards as we celebrate
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.000]   the launch of my newest course, which is called How to Borrow Money Safely and Never Pay Interest
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.640]   Using Credit Cards.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.680]   And so on Monday, of course, I shared with you one of my arguments, an excerpt from the
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.000]   course called Credit Card Debt is a Very Safe Form of Debt.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.800]   I also shared with you on Tuesday another argument called Credit Card Loans Can Provide
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.680]   a Way to Privately Purchase Goods and Services.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.400]   On Wednesday, yesterday, I shared with you an excerpt of the course called How to Manage
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.840]   Cash While You Pay Off Your Credit Cards.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.320]   And today, I'm not going to share with you an excerpt, but I want to answer one important
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   question, which is who should not have credit cards and frankly, who should not take my
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.040]   course because as I said to you on Monday, my course is designed if you have a credit
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.600]   card currently of any kind, one or 50, or if you think you might ever have a credit
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.800]   card in the future, I really want you to learn from what I have to teach you in this particular
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.800]   course.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.600]   So remember this week, if you sign up before we go on, sign up this week prior to Monday,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.360]   October 15, 2018, you can save 10 bucks by going to radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.240]   to sign up and then using the coupon code creditcard10, T-E-N, that'll save you 10
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.960]   bucks, brings the total cost of the course down to $29.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.280]   So do that now if you haven't done it yet because tomorrow I am hosting a live Q&A call
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.600]   for anyone who has purchased the course and I really want to actually have some callers
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   and not do that by myself.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.040]   And I want to answer your specific questions in that Friday live Q&A call.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.440]   Now let's talk about who shouldn't have credit cards.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.240]   Here is the major challenge in the world of credit cards.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.540]   There are a lot of us who have been burned by debt.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.800]   One of the worst things about credit cards, one of the big arguments against credit cards
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.820]   is that they make overspending very, very easy.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.920]   If I were to go and to try to figure out what I think is an archetypal example of how credit
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.800]   card debt works, I would go back and use my own story because I think it's probably about
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.920]   the same as most people.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   I first signed up for my first credit card on my 18th birthday and I did so because I
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.360]   was a personal finance nerd and I'd read all kinds of books on how to improve my credit
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.360]   score.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.800]   I knew how important my credit score was and I decided that the best way to do that was
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.200]   to sign up for a credit card, of course.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.660]   So, of course, it was a very small credit card.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.900]   Now when you're building up your credit score, one of the first things that you want to do
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.720]   is start to establish credit accounts and then to let those credit accounts season.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.580]   They need time because, of course, one of the big influences on your credit score is
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.220]   the length of credit that you have.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.700]   And so I started to use my credit card, but I was very, very focused on always paying
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.700]   it off.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.500]   Very, very focused.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.800]   Most people are.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.020]   Most people sign up for a credit card with a clear intention of never carrying a balance.
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.620]   I have again and again and again heard people say, "I use credit cards and I never carry
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.620]   a balance."
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.020]   I think that's great.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.400]   I did the same thing for at least a couple years.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.300]   And then at that point in time, I was kind of in a bind.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.920]   I think this happened during the end of my sophomore year of college.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.620]   And here's what my personal situation was.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.220]   I was working my way through college.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.180]   I paid for my own college and I'm very thankful for that.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.180]   It was a great thing.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.380]   My parents always said, "We'd love for you to go to school, but pay for it yourself."
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.220]   So work hard and get good grades.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.220]   I love that plan.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.220]   It was a great plan.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.400]   So I paid for my own college, but I didn't have enough scholarships to cover all of my
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.100]   tuition, and I chose to go to a fairly expensive private school.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.700]   I also chose to live on campus because I wanted to have the full so-called college experience,
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   which also brought a whole bunch of other expenses, which in hindsight were unnecessary
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.860]   and I wish I hadn't done it, but whatever.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.480]   That was the decision that I made as an 18-year-old.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.640]   My freshman year of college, I worked a total of about three jobs throughout the year in
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.700]   order to pay for my schooling.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.420]   And I was able to get through my freshman year of college without borrowing money.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.980]   I had scholarships that covered some of my expenses.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.020]   I had an on-campus job in my dorm that gave me a small amount of income.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.460]   I spent my weekends doing construction work during the day, especially Saturday.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.560]   I had one employer who was building an addition on his house.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.020]   He was also in the construction trade, and so I'd go and work with him every Saturday
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.340]   in addition to some other stuff whenever I had school breaks.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.780]   And then I also drove a bicycle rickshaw around the city where I lived on Thursday night,
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.740]   Friday night, and Saturday night to provide income from driving the bicycle rickshaw around.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.620]   Those are my three jobs.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.100]   And frankly, I was tired by the end of the year.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.780]   I was tired.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.620]   And I spent so much time working that I missed out on some of the other playing that I could
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.120]   have done if I hadn't been spending so much time working.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.880]   When you go and on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, you have a job in the afternoon and evenings
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.740]   outside of your class, then on Thursday evening, you go down and ride a bicycle rickshaw from
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.820]   what, I guess, probably about six o'clock till 10 o'clock.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.460]   And then on Friday, you go and ride from five o'clock until 2 a.m.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.260]   And then you get up early and at 8 a.m. you're on the construction job site, work from eight
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.140]   till four, and then four o'clock, go home, shower, put on your clothes, and go ride the
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.660]   bicycle rickshaw from five or six until 2 a.m. again.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.020]   Well, you could understand I was a little bit tired.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.420]   And so I decided that I was going to take it easier.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.800]   So I pulled back and in my sophomore year of school, I pulled back my course load from
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.660]   I think I'd been taking 15 and 18 hours my freshman year, pulled it back to 12 or 15
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.680]   hours, and I decided to quit working.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.080]   And so I took out student loans, but I didn't know enough to take out more student loans
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   for my expenses.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.720]   I just took out student loans for my tuition, which also covered my room and board.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.600]   And I didn't know how to cover my other expenses.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.000]   So I went ahead and started using my credit card to pay for food, put gas in the car,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   et cetera.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.280]   And my credit card started, debt started to build.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.740]   Now my junior year of school, I studied abroad.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.840]   And I, again, my credit card debt started to build.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   And I wound up coming back from my study abroad with significant amount of student loan debt
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.960]   and significant credit card debt, not knowing what to do.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.400]   And I experienced that first place that most of us have been.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.480]   I've got a bunch of debt, and I don't know how to pay it off, which means I had to go
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.400]   to work.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.040]   Now I worked really hard my senior year, and I paid off the credit card debt, paid off
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.160]   the credit card debt, paid off my student loans, was able to graduate, sorry, was able
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.840]   to pay off all my debt before and graduate debt free, which was great.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.120]   Until a number of years later, when I was building a business and I didn't have enough
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.200]   money and I started borrowing money and credit card debt again.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.640]   And along the way, I've made all the decisions about, I'm never going to borrow credit card
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   debt.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.740]   And then I'm going to embrace credit card debt fully.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.080]   And I've vacillated back and forth.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.200]   A major influence on my life when I was in college was the teaching of Dave Ramsey against
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.800]   debt, against credit cards.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.960]   And I followed his advice.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.200]   At least once or twice, I entirely canceled every credit card that I have.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   I shared with you last week that when I was in college at that point in time, I had worked
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.480]   hard to build up my credit card, available credit limits up to about a hundred thousand
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   dollars.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.200]   Well, after college, when I got out of debt, I canceled all of those and I had no credit
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.080]   cards, no access to credit.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.560]   Now here's what I've learned watching and doing financial counseling with many people.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.940]   Most people's experiences will reflect my own.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:54.280]   In the sense that we are committed to not carrying a credit card balance until we actually
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.240]   do carry a credit card balance.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.920]   Or we're committed to not borrowing money on credit cards.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.800]   And we may even cancel our credit cards until we wind up in a situation where we see no
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.560]   other alternative.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.000]   And then we go ahead and apply for them again.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.600]   I can't remember the exact details of when I applied for credit cards after having canceled
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.520]   them all, but it went much like many people's lives where I had canceled all my credit cards.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.680]   I'm not going to go borrow the money.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.960]   And then I went into credit card debt again.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:31.400]   And hopefully this doesn't sound too harsh, but you're probably just about like me because
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:38.240]   in my years doing this, I have stopped believing people when they said, I don't carry a balance
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.080]   or I don't have credit card debt.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.920]   Now it's not that people are necessarily insincere about that.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:54.280]   I believe people when they say, yeah, I don't mean to carry a balance, but life happens.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.320]   And I could take 15 minutes and describe specific people that said, I don't borrow money on
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.160]   credit cards or I don't carry a credit card debt balance.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.720]   And then a couple of years later, I found out that they had one.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.720]   What happened in between?
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.480]   Well, life happened.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.000]   Nothing changed.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.520]   And it hurt me for a while because I stopped counting on people.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.540]   I stopped believing anything people said till I just realized that just like me, they believed
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.440]   it when they said it, but they hadn't thought ahead to understand the situation that they
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.780]   might be in someday.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.180]   And I don't think this credit card business of should I have a credit card or not have
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.540]   a credit card is as simple or as black and white as many people wish it were.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.560]   Because although credit cards can be extremely dangerous, they can also be extremely safe.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.220]   And although credit cards can enable routine overspending, they can also be a way out of
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.920]   a crisis.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.860]   Many people have tried to start a business using their credit cards and have failed completely
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.720]   and declared bankruptcy.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.340]   Many people have also successfully started a business using financing from their credit
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.100]   cards.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.860]   Credit cards can be valuable.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.280]   They can be very useful.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.660]   But circumstances are different for different people.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.180]   Now here is the conviction that I have come to.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.500]   I make this very clear in the course in a module called, "Should You Use Credit Cards
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.000]   as a Source of Financing?"
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.780]   It's my personal belief that you should never accumulate credit card debt.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.620]   You should never accumulate credit card debt.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:46.260]   And I will fight tooth and nail to try to persuade you of that position.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.100]   I will fight tooth and nail to try to help you to avoid what I've seen so many people
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.060]   do.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:59.540]   Most commonly, somebody loses their job, they get their hours cut back at work, something
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:05.660]   happens and they don't curb their spending because they think it's a temporary problem.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.080]   That's where most people wind up in credit card debt.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.800]   They think, "Well, I just got laid off, but I'll probably get a job in a month or
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:20.580]   two so it won't be a big deal to pay off a month or two worth of credit card debt."
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.460]   And then six months later, they're still unemployed and they're stuck.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.980]   Or they get their hours cut or their pay cut for whatever reason and they think, "Well,
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.540]   it's only temporary, it's only a small amount," and they don't make drastic decisions.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.820]   And I'm here to beg you and plead with you, don't do that.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.580]   First, don't be a stupid young person routinely overspending as so many of us have, buying
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.780]   stupid things that you can't afford and paying retail prices because you just swipe
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.780]   your credit card.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.780]   Don't do that.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.780]   But you know that already.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.980]   And I'm here to beg with you and plead with you, don't ever allow yourself to choose
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.100]   to go into debt when you're facing personal hardship.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:03.260]   It will be easier for you to always cut your expenses quickly than it will be for you to
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.460]   go into debt.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:12.940]   It'll be much easier for you to make that decision because it shortens the overall length
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.900]   of your pain.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:22.020]   If you lose your job and you find yourself without choices, meaning you don't have income,
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:29.780]   but yet you need to put some food in your refrigerator, don't use a credit card.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.180]   Because if you do use a credit card and you go out and this month you spend your typical
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:39.460]   $700 on food, here's the problem.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:47.740]   You'll accumulate $700 of credit card debt, which you'll then maintain until six months
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.180]   from now you get reemployed again.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:57.660]   But six months from now you're going to have a food budget again of $700.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:04.740]   So now six months from now you're going to have double the food expenses.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.700]   You're going to have $700 of, let's just pretend that today is October, so six months from
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.020]   now is April.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:15.820]   You're going to have the $700 April budget and you're going to have the $700 October
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.940]   budget to pay off.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.740]   It's hard to pay $1,400 off in a month.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:28.140]   You say, of course, nobody would pay $1,400 off in a month.
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.620]   They'll just pay $14 off in a month.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:38.020]   And what that means is this month, the October food budget, this month will get extended
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.060]   out over the next few years because it's going to take you years to pay off the credit card
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.620]   debt.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.420]   When you finance a problem using debt, you extend that problem far beyond where it ever
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.140]   needs to be extended.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.900]   So if you lose your job and in October you need food, don't put October's food bill on
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   the next year.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.260]   Rather, October should be the time when you cut your budget down and you change your diet
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.780]   and you eat beans and rice and peanut butter and bread every day.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.460]   October should be the month that you go down to the food pantry and ask for help.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.140]   October should be the month that you apply for food stamps and get the money and go to
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.580]   the grocery store in October.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.940]   October should be the month that you say yes to your neighbor who wants to give you bags
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.460]   of zucchini and tomatoes.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.900]   October should be the month that you go over to your parents' house and say, "Mom and Dad,
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.900]   do you have any extra food?"
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.100]   And they say, "Sure, here's a $200 gift certificate to the local grocery store."
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.820]   Do that in October because then in April, when you're well employed, you will only have
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.100]   April's expenses to deal with.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.180]   So I don't ever want you to go into credit card debt.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.780]   I don't ever want you to be in that desperate situation.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.900]   Now if you're in that situation, my course will help you to get out of it, but it will
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:54.260]   also help you to never go there again.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.660]   Credit cards really can be a danger.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:03.460]   So who should not have credit cards and who should not buy my course?
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:11.940]   If you're a debt addict, as with many addictions, I think you better be pretty careful.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.620]   This is reality.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:26.260]   If you made a solemn promise, a solemn vow to yourself to say, "I will never borrow money,"
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.740]   and I mean that comprehensively, if you make that solemn promise, "I will never borrow
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:41.340]   money," and you are absolutely committed to that, and I mean absolutely, then of course
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.340]   you could do without credit cards.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:50.220]   Now I've never really met the person who would make that solemn of a vow.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.140]   Maybe Dave Ramsey, sorry, let me rephrase.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.220]   Dave Ramsey has made that vow, and I'm sure that there are some people who have.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.700]   I've talked to a few.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.180]   I should modify my statement.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:07.940]   I have talked to a few people, and frankly, I am much closer to that than probably you
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.940]   are.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.060]   I'm 99% there.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.780]   I am 99% there.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.420]   But if you're in that situation, then you don't need credit cards, and you don't need
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.500]   my credit card course.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:27.420]   But I want to ask you, are you absolutely there?
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.300]   Because if you're not absolutely there, I still want you to learn what I have to teach
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.220]   you in the course.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.700]   Because most people are not absolutely there.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.220]   They're 80% there.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.280]   They're 90% there.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.860]   But it's that last 10% that is so tricky.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:51.660]   Because the time where that 10% matters is not normal life.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.180]   It's crisis.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.180]   The time to think about crisis is now.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:04.900]   The time to think about what you're going to do then is now when you're not in crisis.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.720]   Now I don't have addictions that some people have.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   Some people have drug addictions.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.680]   Some people have alcohol addictions.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.700]   In the past, the closest I've ever gotten to an addiction in the past, I was addicted
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.960]   to pornography.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.380]   If you've ever been addicted to something, you know how hard it can be, how hard you
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:27.900]   have to fight to think in advance what you're going to do in that circumstance.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.860]   If you were an alcohol addict, you know that if you're going to choose not to drink, you've
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:40.340]   got to put up major, major safeguards against drinking or drugs.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.260]   If you're a pornography addict or if you've ever been addicted to pornography, you know
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.100]   that perhaps somebody might be able to go there.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.840]   Somebody else might be able to go to that website.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.280]   But for you, you've got to stay 100 miles away because that will trigger those chains
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.280]   of addiction.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:04.940]   It'll trigger that well-worn groove in your mind that winds up in a place you don't want
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.780]   to be.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.820]   And part of maturity is recognizing where you are weak.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.620]   Part of maturity is recognizing that you're simply not a robot and making good decisions
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:27.580]   in advance so that when the door is opened, you don't walk through it.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:34.520]   If there's something to you that's important, then you'll put in place safeguards to make
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.740]   sure you don't go where you don't want to be.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.100]   And the same thing can happen with debt.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:47.740]   So if you are addicted to overspending, if you've proven again and again that you don't
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:52.580]   have self-control, it's not a bit of problem in my mind if you just recognize that and
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.100]   say, "I'm not going there."
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.340]   Now while you're on your way out of debt, I think you need to take my course because
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.340]   I can get you out cheaper.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.140]   But it's fine with me if you cancel all your credit cards on the other side.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.380]   And I don't think you should feel ashamed about that.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.380]   I simply caution you on this.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.120]   Make sure that decision is absolute.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.320]   Make sure it's irrevocable.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.380]   Make sure you are 100% committed to saying, "I'm never going to be in debt."
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:31.220]   Make sure it's absolute because if not, well, you'll wind up stuck.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.040]   You'll wind up deep in debt.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.340]   You won't have done the stuff that I think you should do to prepare yourself for it.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:44.620]   And you'll wind up exploited by the credit card industry instead of learning how to exploit
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.260]   the credit card industry.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.860]   I don't think you're stupid for avoiding credit cards.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.060]   I don't think you're stupid for avoiding credit cards any more than I think that somebody
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:04.840]   who entirely avoids ever drinking any alcohol is stupid for entirely avoiding alcohol.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.220]   Please don't ever let yourself feel stupid because you make an absolute decision.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.780]   If your dad was a stumbling drunk and you say, "That's it.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.780]   I'm never drinking."
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.460]   That's not stupid.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460]   It's not.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.140]   And the same thing applies to credit card debt.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:28.780]   If you come from financial ruin and your dad was a stumbling debt addict that's in your
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.780]   background, it's not stupid.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.380]   Just honestly assess it.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.980]   And if that's the case, then I say, "Good for you."
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.980]   Here's the reality.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.420]   I close with this thought.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.100]   Number of years ago, I read a lot of fancy strategies.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:54.580]   I talk about a lot of fancy, sexy financial strategies.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.580]   Sometimes these things work.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.580]   You know what though?
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.580]   A lot of times they don't.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.340]   It's funny.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.680]   I spent years as a financial advisor and of course the biggest, the number one most powerful
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.780]   financial guru and most listened to voice in the United States of America is Dave Ramsey.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:17.180]   And you want to talk about a guy who just annoys financial advisors generally, Dave
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.460]   Ramsey, because he's simplistic.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.420]   Now there's a fair argument to be made that's overly simplistic.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.820]   I appreciate actually his over simplifying at this point because it's effective.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.700]   It's more effective than what I do sometimes.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:40.420]   But the reality is that if you just follow simplistic advice, it works.
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:46.140]   Now you'll get made fun of for it, but it works.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.540]   It really does work.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:56.780]   And you shouldn't feel ashamed about that.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:04.100]   Same thing applies to debt as it applies to anything else in life.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.460]   The teetotalers are right.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:13.580]   If you never take your first drink of alcohol, you're never going to become an alcoholic.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.980]   If you never do drugs, you're never going to be a drug addict.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:24.780]   If you never go on long business trips alone with people of the opposite sex or put yourself
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:31.260]   in situations of people with the opposite sex, you're not going to cheat on your spouse.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.340]   And if you don't open credit cards, you're not going to be in credit card debt.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.460]   So don't feel bad about that.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.300]   I respect you.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.260]   I respect your decision.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.580]   I don't fault it one bit.

[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.980]   money in any form, because that's where I want to emphasize, I would rather borrow money
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.620]   on a credit card than many other forms of financing.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.380]   But if you're committed to that, hey, go for it.
