[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.260]   been focused on the topic of credit cards as we celebrate
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.180]   the launch of my newest course, which is called how to borrow
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.040]   money safely and never pay interest using credit cards. And
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.740]   so on Monday, of course, I shared with you one of my
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.460]   arguments and excerpt from the course called credit card debt

[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:26.280]   And then I also drove a bicycle rickshaw around the city where I lived on Thursday night, Friday night, and Saturday night to provide income from driving the bicycle rickshaw around.

[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:20.460]   This is reality. If you made a solemn promise, a solemn vow to yourself to say, "I will never borrow money," and I mean that comprehensively, if you make that solemn promise, "I will

[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:50.480]   I will never borrow money," and you are absolutely committed to that. I mean, absolutely. Then, of course, you could do without credit cards. Now, I've never really met the person who would make that solemn of a vow. Maybe Dave Ramsey has made that vow, and I'm sure that there are some people who have. I've talked to a few. I should modify my statement.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.700]   I have talked to a few people.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.700]   And frankly, I am much closer to that than probably you are.

[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.020]   I am 99% there.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.520]   But if you're in that situation, then you don't need credit cards, and you don't need my credit card course.

[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.520]   But I would ask you, are you absolutely there?
