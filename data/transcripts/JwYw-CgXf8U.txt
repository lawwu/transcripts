[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.340]   Hello, my name is Dave Kerlin, I'm a real estate salesperson.
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.500]   My question is in regard to the capture
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.100]   and review parts of your productivity system.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.140]   I know you use Trello and I personally have adopted using it myself,
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.660]   but as the number of Trello cards get bigger and bigger,
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.740]   the list gets longer, I find it difficult to effectively look at them
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.340]   and make decisions about what to do and not to do.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.500]   You have alluded to David Allen's system in the past
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.900]   and I'm familiar with his method of capturing things in context categories.
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.140]   Is there a reason you don't create more columns in Trello and use this method?
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.700]   It seems like it would be a more efficient way to review these tasks,
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.960]   et cetera, when doing daily and weekly planning
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.260]   and dealing with a really big list of possible activities and projects.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.000]   Love your podcast, it's been so helpful
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.760]   and the time blocking method has helped me immensely.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.500]   Thanks.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.140]   So I would do with Trello with card overload, three things.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.740]   One, more boards.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.760]   So I'm a big believer in different boards for different roles.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.300]   You can even have different boards for different projects
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.140]   if it's a major project, but there's something about having a fixed
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.700]   and specific context for the task you're looking at
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.460]   that actually makes it much easier to grok what's on your plate.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.500]   And so to have a role for teaching, to have a role for research,
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.900]   to have a role for writing, to have a role for media stuff like podcasting,
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.960]   to have a role for a particular heavy service road,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.320]   like I'm the director of graduate studies,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.520]   all those can be different boards. So that helps.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.160]   Two is more columns. I think it's fine if you want more columns.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.200]   I don't like there to be too many because I don't want to fiddle too much.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.500]   I prefer sort of generic columns things can go into.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.660]   I've talked about this before on the show.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.600]   I don't always do a column for each project, for example,
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.420]   but maybe I will if it's a big project that has a lot of tasks.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.500]   So you can use more columns if that helps.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.520]   If you have 30 columns, you're going to have a different problem.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.560]   But if you want to go to seven columns instead of four,
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.300]   and that makes a big difference, fine.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.220]   Third, and this goes against Allen orthodoxy, but I do it,
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.420]   is consolidate more on the individual cards.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.300]   So a Trello card can actually capture a lot of information.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.800]   If you're in an Allen mindset, by contrast,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   every item in your list is a very specific action
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.220]   that requires no further thinking. You can just execute that action.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.720]   I will often have a card that maybe on the back
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.460]   has a 10 element action list,
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.600]   and three of those things are already crossed out.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.760]   So the card is just saying whatever it is,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.200]   working on getting podcast,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.760]   you know, uploaded to all the relevant platforms,
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.900]   registered with the relevant platforms, that might be a card.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.500]   Now on the back, there might be 10 different platforms listed.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.160]   And in the notes section, I'm beginning to capture notes
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.360]   about the URL and the instructions for doing it for each of those platforms.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120]   And maybe some of those platforms I've already done
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.700]   and some of them are still exposed.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.520]   And all of that gets visually compressed to a single card.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.000]   And I know what that means when I see it during a review,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.500]   like, oh, yeah, I'm working on that.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.360]   Maybe I should put aside some time to get a couple more of those done.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.900]   So that really, I think, makes your deck a lot more shallow,
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.400]   where a lot of things can get consolidated into a single card.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.460]   So I would do those three things.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.720]   If you're still overloaded, that might be another issue.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.100]   Then maybe you're doing way too many things
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.760]   and there's a whole essentialism conversation to have.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.200]   Go see Greg McKeown's book, Essentialism, for more on that.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.120]   But until then, do those three things, more boards, more columns,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.200]   more on the back of each individual card.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.920]   That makes a big difference.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.140]   (electronic music)
