[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.100]   Pastor John, you have a new edition out of your book Brothers, We Are Not
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.460]   Professionals, and it's a book for pastors, but I remember reading it cover
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.140]   to cover for my own Christian Growth several years back, and in this new
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.940]   edition, what's changed is you've added six new chapters, and one of those
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.420]   chapters is on exercise. It's not easy to explain the body-soul dynamic; this is
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.580]   pretty tricky stuff, but what have you learned as you've thought through the
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.700]   topic of exercise and why exercise matters? I learned things from the Bible,
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.260]   and then I learned things from trying to work it out. What I see in the Bible is
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.540]   that bodily training is of some value. 1st Timothy 4, 8. Spiritual training is
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.660]   of value in every way, so if you have to choose, choose spiritual training, but he
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.980]   does say bodily fitness, bodily training is of some value, so I know in Paul's
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.980]   mind there's some good in this, and he says in 1st Corinthians 6,
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.020]   "I won't be enslaved by anything. The stomach is for food, food is for the
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.780]   stomach, both will be cast away, and all things are lawful for me, but not all
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.860]   things help, all things are legitimate for me, but I won't be enslaved by any,"
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.300]   which means Christians should never be in bondage to food and drink, which means
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.520]   you should ask, "Well, what should be the guideline?" And I would assume with
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.140]   Jonathan Edwards, who had resolutions about this, that we eat in a way and we
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.820]   drink in a way that doesn't deny the sheer pleasure that God intends us to
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.060]   have, he says that plainly in the pastoral epistles, but don't jeopardize our own
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.780]   faith or another's faith, our own health, that would undercut our ability to
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.780]   serve Him. You know, in that same text, I remember years ago, seeing for the
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.460]   first time, it says, "The Lord is for the body, and the body is for the Lord," and I
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.420]   always heard, "The body is for the Lord," my mother, you know, taught me not to
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.100]   smoke because your body's the temple of the Holy Spirit, and you don't treat your body
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.180]   that way. That argument worked for me as a kid, but I never noticed the
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.940]   Lord is for the body, which means God is very pro-body, He's not a Platonist. He's
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.260]   gonna, He created the body, He's gonna raise the body from the dead, He believes
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.780]   in the body, He wants us, therefore, I think, to take care of the body. So that's
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.500]   that's my biblical piece. My practical piece is this, two things. When I was in
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.820]   Germany, remember, realizing for the first time, so I'm between 25 and 28 years old,
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.340]   I'm real slow, so I should have known this earlier, but when I lack sleep, I get
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.820]   irritable. That is, I'm impatient. When I get enough sleep, I'm less irritable and
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.980]   more patient, and that created a huge theological problem for me, because the
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.860]   Bible says that patience is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, and now I've just said
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.340]   it's a fruit of sleep. So you talked about the soul-body dynamic, well, there
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.140]   it is. Crystal clear, my sanctification level rises and falls with eight hours
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.500]   versus five hours of sleep. How in the world can that be biblical? And the way I
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.820]   resolve that is this, the way the Holy Spirit, who knows that we are soul and
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.020]   body, produces His fruit is not only directly by giving us supernatural power
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.940]   to be patient when we haven't gotten enough sleep, but He also gives us the
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.300]   humility to go to bed and stop playing God and get enough sleep and admit, "Okay,
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.060]   staying up another two hours either to waste it on TV or to work my tail off
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.140]   trying to get more done on my dissertation, both of those are sinful,
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.260]   and you are bringing about your impatience by failing to sleep." And the
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.980]   Holy Spirit cuts that off and says, "No, you must be humble. I'm going to make
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.380]   you humble enough to go to bed." That's one. And here's the other one. I know
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.420]   that I'm prone to depression and discouragement, and I have simply
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.020]   discovered, Tony, that if I go to the gym three times a week and hammer my body,
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.540]   that is get on an elliptical and push through three, four, five miles and sweat
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.540]   two, three pounds off, I don't get depressed as often, period. Now, I'm
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.620]   sure there are physical reasons for that, these little endorphins or
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.780]   something that are released in the brain or whatever, or it could be just I'm
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.340]   satisfied with myself more than if I just sit and vegetate at home. Whatever
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.900]   it is, I know that works. I know depression hurts my ministry, depression
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.260]   hurts my marriage, depression hurts my parenting. So, for the sake of kingdom
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.380]   purposes, I'm off to the gym. You know, you can just leave aside exercise. That's a
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.700]   big controversy, but eating is not controversial. Everybody has to eat to
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.340]   live, and everybody has to sleep to live. Those are two. You can live without
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.820]   exercise, but you can't live without eating and sleeping. And then the question
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.660]   becomes, "All right, how do I govern my eating and sleeping to maximize my
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.740]   life, my soul, for the kingdom?" And everybody will discover the connections
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.220]   if they think about it. Thank you, Pastor John. The newly re-released book is titled
