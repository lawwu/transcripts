[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   So I actually asked David, what should I do when things get tough?
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.760]   This is a good fucking question, man, because it's going to get fucking
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.240]   difficult day after day after day.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.040]   That's the thing about what you're doing right now.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.840]   That's that's challenging is a lot of motherfuckers can sign up
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.200]   for the fucking one day event.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.400]   A lot of people do a lot of these CEOs, a lot of these people
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.080]   who don't want to suffer, you know, as a living,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.480]   who don't want to suffer as making it a habit.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.480]   What they do is they go out and they recruit these people to put them
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480]   through a two day, three day fucking challenge.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.560]   Anybody can do that shit because your mind can process
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.440]   two or three fucking days of suck.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000]   What you're doing, my friend, is going to be damn near a month of suck.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.360]   So basically, you're going to have a lot of days, especially in the morning time.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.520]   The mornings when you wake up and your body says, go fuck yourself,
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.120]   because I don't fucking like doing this today.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.520]   And you're going to look at because you're running six miles a day, I believe.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.320]   Which, you know, what's going to happen to your fucking ass?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.080]   Is you're going to wake up in the morning and you're going to fucking do what I do.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.600]   People think, oh, David Goggins just wakes the fuck up
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200]   and he just gets to shit on. He gets this fuck.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.280]   No, I don't. I don't get up and get after it.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200]   I look at my shoes sometimes for hours.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.880]   I pass them. I go.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.680]   I get something to drink. I go to the bathroom.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.760]   I watch TV. I'll start doing some work.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.560]   And I look at those fucking shoes because why my body's saying, go fuck yourself.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.760]   So you have to be able to win the morning.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.280]   You have to be able to not allow that to get too deep in your brain.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.320]   And when things get really tough for you, when you're out there on like day 17
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.000]   and your knees are hurting and your back is hurting, your shoulders are hurting,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.800]   your elbow, elbow tendonitis and all kind of shit going on.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.440]   You got to start remembering your resume.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.280]   A lot of people don't remember what the fuck they've accomplished in life.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   And at that time of suffering, you have to be able to fucking go through
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.280]   and pull up that fucking who the fuck I am resume and say, oh, for you,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.920]   you I'm sure you studied your fucking ass off for hours and days and years
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.920]   to get where you're at.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.480]   I guarantee you did shit harder than this.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.080]   And that's basically what you have to go back to.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.040]   But it's hard to do because in that moment of suffering,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   all you can fucking think about is getting the fuck out of it.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.920]   So you got to take that one second to pull yourself out of that suffering
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.280]   to have a clear fucking thought.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.120]   It's hard to have clear thoughts in the midst of extreme pain and suffering.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.040]   Find that clear thought.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.320]   Remind yourself of what you've been through back in the past,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.160]   back in the day to get to where you're at today.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.720]   So that's what I do is a counselor reminder.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.240]   And then through that process, I guarantee you your mind and body will say, oh,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.800]   we got this. We've we've been here before.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.400]   Maybe not in that kind of pain and suffering, but we've been here
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.240]   before in the demons of your own mind.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.440]   So that's the best reminder in the world.
