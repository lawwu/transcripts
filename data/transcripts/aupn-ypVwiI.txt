[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:09.160]   But ideologies in the current climate are seductive to people because they are mindless.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.360]   But what they want you to do is buy the package and shut down alternative discussions.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.520]   We think critically because we think biblically and we have the mind of Christ.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.680]   First Corinthians 2.16, you have the mind of Christ.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.840]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:37.340]   I determine to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:01:00.800]   Christ is everything.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.900]   Christ is everything.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.880]   It amazes me how the church,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.820]   church as church leaders can totally lose their focus on Christ
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.260]   and wander off into all kinds of other subjects, themes.
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.920]   It's very sad.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.000]   Our focus should always be on Him in our personal lives and in our church life as well.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.320]   Church, quote-unquote, experts would tell you that if the church wants to reach the world,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.820]   we have to find out what the world means.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.820]   We have to find out what the world wants when just the opposite is true.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:55.060]   The Christian faith will always, always lose its influence when it tries to accommodate the world.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.940]   You get the opposite results than what you hoped for.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.900]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.500]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.020]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.520]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.620]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.620]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.720]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.820]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.320]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.820]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.020]   Clearly, churches have little influence in the world.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.480]   Because they are trying to give the world what it wants,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.580]   because they are trying to give the world what it wants,
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.620]   because they are trying to give the world what it wants,
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.300]   rather than obey the Lord who is the head of the church.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.320]   rather than obey the Lord who is the head of the church.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.980]   rather than obey the Lord who is the head of the church.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.280]   There is no text in the entire New Testament
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.320]   There is no text in the entire New Testament
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   There is no text in the entire New Testament
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.900]   that commands the church to give lost sinners what they want.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.920]   that commands the church to give lost sinners what they want.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.620]   that commands the church to give lost sinners what they want.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620]   On the other hand, the church is not a church that is a church that is a church.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.640]   On the other hand, the church is not a church that is a church.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   On the other hand, the church is not a church that is a church. The church is to obey the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.680]   The church is to obey the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.000]   The church is to obey the Lord Jesus Christ, to confront the culture as the church.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.440]   There is nothing in the New Testament that calls the church to change social structures,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.660]   to be engaged in political efforts, economic efforts.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.680]   The church that effectively runs the church,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.600]   The church that effectively runs the church,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:20.220]   The church that effectively runs the church, that reaches the lost, is the church that is relentlessly devoted to being what the Lord of the church commands his church to be.
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:32.200]   If a church has little influence in the world, don't ask what the world wants, ask what the Lord requires.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.840]   Be the church.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.860]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.900]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.940]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church. It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.960]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church. It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.980]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.020]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.080]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.120]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.860]   It has always been our passion here to obey and honor and exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.920]   It has always been the church that has been the most important part of the church.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:54.020]   We have no interest in what the children of the devil want a church to be that is irrelevant.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.080]   We have no interest in what the children of the devil want a church to be that is irrelevant.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.200]   We have no interest in what the children of the devil want a church to be that is irrelevant.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.020]   And furthermore, beyond being irrelevant, it invites the devil in.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.080]   And furthermore, beyond being irrelevant, it invites the devil in.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.080]   And furthermore, beyond being irrelevant, it invites the devil in.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.760]   And furthermore, beyond being relevant, it invites the devil in.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.760]   In the Reformation, there was a principle that was articulated called the formal principle.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.800]   In the Reformation, there was a principle that was articulated called the formal principle.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.320]   In the Reformation, there was a principle that was articulated called the formal principle.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.360]   The formal principle was simply what the Reformers identified as the truth that the Word of God is the sole authority in the kingdom of God, therefore in the church.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.400]   The formal principle was simply what the Reformers identified as the truth that the Word of God is the sole authority in the kingdom of God, therefore in the church.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:25.320]   The formal principle was simply what the Reformers identified as the truth that the Word of God is the sole authority in the kingdom of God, therefore in the church.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.360]   So the church is to be whatever the Word of God is.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.400]   So the church is to be whatever the Word of God is.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.420]   So the church is to be whatever the Word of God tells it to be.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.120]   That is the formal principle.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:44.620]   We have only one divine revelation for the life of the church, and that is Holy Scripture.
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.160]   And when you get into the New Testament epistles like Ephesians and the rest of them,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.180]   And when you get into the New Testament epistles like Ephesians and the rest of them,
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.220]   you find that they are designed to make sure that the Word of God is the sole authority in the kingdom of God.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.900]   you find that they are designed to make sure that the Word of God is the sole authority in the kingdom of God.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.920]   you find that they are designed to make sure that the Word of God is the sole authority in the kingdom of God.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   you find that they are designed to make sure that the Word of God is the sole authority in the kingdom of God.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:08.160]   To make sure that every subsequent generation of Christians and churches understands the will of the Lord for their life and conduct.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.680]   That is true of the epistles in general, but particularly true of Ephesians.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.440]   Early on in the ministry here, I wanted to dig into Ephesians because it's so absolutely definitive.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.040]   Early on in the ministry here, I wanted to dig into Ephesians because it's so absolutely definitive.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.080]   Early on in the ministry here, I wanted to dig into Ephesians because it's so absolutely definitive.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.140]   As to the life of the church.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.380]   Here is heaven's instruction book for the church to be the church.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.900]   There's not a word in it about what the world wants.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:50.660]   Nothing about how to engage politically, socially, culturally.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.940]   It's all about how to follow the Lord.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.960]   It's all about how to follow the Lord.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.640]   It's all about how to follow the Lord who is the head of the church.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.340]   How to be consumed with Christ.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.400]   That's why the epistle begins essentially in verse 3.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.080]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ."
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.440]   Everything is in Christ.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.640]   Everything.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.920]   It's all about our relationship to Christ.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.480]   It's all about knowing Him, loving Him.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.820]   Adoring Him.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.480]   Declaring Him.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.160]   And becoming like Him.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.220]   That's what the church needs to be.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.120]   The more it's like the world, the more it forfeits its influence.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:53.000]   The more it tamper's with the world, the more divisive it becomes, the more cantankerous it becomes, the more fractured it becomes, the more exposed its weakness become.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.640]   It is a deadly danger for the church, any church, anywhere, to be anything other than what the Lord of the church has designed the church to be.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.880]   And we have all the information in the Revelation of the New Testament.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.660]   So as we look at the book of Ephesians, we're going to notice that in the first three chapters, the emphasis is on doctrine.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.000]   That is what we believe.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.520]   And the last three chapters is the practice of doctrine.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.360]   And the last three chapters is the practical section, how we behave.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.760]   And how we behave is predicated by what we believe.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:40.180]   So we're going to see, first of all, what we believe and how that impacts how we behave.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:49.820]   But we're going to jump above the text of Ephesians in a prayer right there in chapter 1.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.040]   This prayer, you almost feel as though you're in a prayer.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:08:00.280]   You almost feel as a kind of interruption in the flow of Paul's revelation for the church.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:14.760]   It's almost as if he can't go another step unless he offers a prayer for the church.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.660]   He's writing to the church in Ephesus.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.600]   It's been four years since he was there.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.560]   Not only to the church in Ephesus.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.000]   But Ephesus was a major town in Asia Minor, and there were other churches listed in Revelation
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   2 and 3.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.980]   They also would have received this letter.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:38.220]   He starts out with that amazing set of blessings, spiritual blessings in Christ.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:44.720]   And then before he starts to go into some more detail about the church and what it believes
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.400]   and how it behaves, he raises a prayer starting in verse 15.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.080]   So look at it with me.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:58.480]   "This is a prayer for the church.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.780]   For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:10.460]   you and your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you while making mention
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:17.100]   of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.600]   give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.920]   I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, and you will know what is the
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.380]   hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.540]   and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.600]   These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might, which He brought
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.140]   about in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:49.600]   heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.120]   is named.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.980]   He gave His name not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.800]   And He put all things in subjection under His feet and gave Him His head over all things
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.700]   to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:12.860]   That is just filled with Christ-centered truth.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:19.640]   And Paul's prayer is that the church would focus on fully understanding what God is saying.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:26.360]   And what is theirs in Christ?
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:34.540]   Every faithful pastor should be leading his church into the deep knowledge of Christ.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:41.100]   Every faithful pastor must live in the constant expression of a desire to see the church filled
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:47.160]   with the wisdom and knowledge that comes with a deep revelation of Christ.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   This is the church being the church.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.900]   This is the church being Christ-centered.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.140]   So let's look at that prayer.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:01.040]   Verse 15: "For this reason" - we'll stop there.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.860]   What reason?
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.060]   What prompts this intercession?
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:12.400]   What prompts this gratitude and this request for a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.200]   knowledge of Christ?
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.220]   For this reason.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.220]   What is the reason?
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.680]   The reason is because of the incomprehension.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.800]   The incomprehension is the incomparable blessings of Christ listed from verse 3 through 14.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's beyond comprehension how rich the blessings and the promises are in Christ that have been
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.360]   granted to every true believer.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.000]   On the basis that we have, as verse 3 says, been blessed with every spiritual blessing
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.880]   in the heavenly places, on the basis that He chose us in Him before the foundation of
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.200]   the world, on the basis that He chose us that we would one day eternally be holy and blessed,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:56.520]   holy and blameless before Him, because in love He predestined us to adoption as sons,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:03.620]   because in verse 7 we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:09.280]   because in all wisdom and insight He made known to us the mystery of His will according
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.340]   to His purpose - verse 10 - of summing up everything in Christ, things in heaven and
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.340]   things on earth.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.720]   That is, He's even given us the end of history.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:25.060]   It all resolves in Christ, because - verse 11 - we have obtained an inheritance to which
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:33.000]   we were predestined according to His divine purpose, because having believed - verse 13
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.780]   - we were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, and nothing can ever alter that future fulfillment
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:47.240]   because, because, because of all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:55.840]   Verse 11: "For this reason I'm praying that you would have a spirit of wisdom and knowledge
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.000]   in the revelation of Him."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.240]   Wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.300]   What is Paul's desire for a church?
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.620]   That they would know Christ, that they would know Him deeply, profoundly.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:16.760]   That's why Paul in Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly."
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.600]   Richly.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.760]   Now he knows he's writing to a true church, because if you look at verse 15, he says,
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:32.220]   "I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you, and your love
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.380]   for all the saints."
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.520]   Why does he mention those?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.640]   Because those are the evidences of true salvation: faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and manifest
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.540]   love for the saints.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.280]   How did he know about this?
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.180]   How did he know that the Ephesian church was doing so well after four years?
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.220]   Well he says he heard.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.220]   He heard about it.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.600]   How would he have heard about it?
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   He's a prisoner in Rome.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.140]   He hasn't seen Him in four years.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.480]   He's incarcerated.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.580]   But prisoners could receive letters, and they could receive visitors.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:10.700]   And over the period of time of his imprisonment, he had received both letters and visitors.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.980]   And the testimonies were always the same.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.800]   It was about the faith of the people in Ephesus.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.260]   And it was about their love for the saints.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.420]   These are evidences of a true church.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.680]   Paul says the same thing to the Thessalonian church.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:34.540]   As he opens that letter, 1 Thessalonians 1:2, 3, and 4, he says, "I know your work of faith
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.120]   and labor of love."
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:43.060]   Faith and love, trusting in Christ, loving the saints.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.320]   This is the mark of a true church.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.420]   That's what a church is.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.740]   That's how you know it's a real church of redeemed people, because their faith is in
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:15:02.920]   Christ, and they manifest the transformation by loving all the saints.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.980]   So we know then that this is a true church.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.780]   This is a church that believes and loves.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.840]   And because it is a true church, Paul can pray for them.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.300]   And they would understand all that belongs to them.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:28.300]   And I just have to say, there are churches with real Christians in them who have no clue
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.240]   what is theirs in Christ.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.620]   They're cheated of that, because they're not taught the Word of God.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:43.040]   Their thoughts and their interests are all over everywhere when they ought to be focused
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.360]   solely and totally on Christ.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:52.400]   It's when you gaze at Christ, 2 Corinthians 3:18, it's when you gaze at Christ that you're
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.240]   changed into His image from one level of glory to the next.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:06.560]   So my prayer, Paul says, for you is that God, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the God
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.540]   who is one in nature with the Lord Jesus Christ, the God who is the Father of glory, the source
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.880]   of all glory, and the end of all glory.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.120]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.480]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.920]   What does a spirit of wisdom mean?
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:35.920]   Well, spirit here is used in the sense of perspective, disposition, attitude.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.520]   This is the way you need to direct your mind and your thoughts.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.400]   I want God to give you a spirit of wisdom.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.360]   "May give you a spirit of wisdom."
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.640]   So what does the pastor pray for, for his people?
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:36.140]   Full wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:43.580]   All spiritual blessings, chapter 1, verse 3, all spiritual blessings, every spiritual
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.180]   blessing in the heavenlies.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:53.400]   Every single spiritual blessing that heaven has is deposited in the lives of those who
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   know Christ.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   Do you understand that?
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.080]   Do you understand the fullness of that?
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.960]   That's where your preoccupation should be, that you become so much like Christ that you
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.920]   radiate His glory.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.740]   That's how the church influences the world.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.540]   This is how the church should live.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:18.720]   We should live with this consuming preoccupation with the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.400]   The Old Testament, He's anticipated, and the New Testament, He's revealed.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.940]   And He is the revelation of God that is the most clear revelation.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.180]   God spoke in time past through the prophets and the writers of the Old Testament.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.780]   In these last days, He's spoken unto us by His Son.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.680]   God is on display in Christ.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:47.760]   Know Christ is to know all the riches of heaven that are yours, because you are His.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.640]   Churches struggle with this.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.440]   They get caught up.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.400]   They get seduced.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.280]   They get away from Christ.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:03.820]   It seems to me that in the current form of evangelicalism, whatever form that is as it
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:11.380]   morphs, there is a consuming preoccupation with everything but Christ.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:23.400]   There will be an endless seduction effort made at the church from human minds, philosophies,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:34.740]   psychological, social, religious, political, to take the church captive, to kidnap the
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:41.860]   church with vain deceit and the traditions of men.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.320]   I know that when you think about the world, you think there's a certain degree of sophistication
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.640]   in the world.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.500]   And on some level there is.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:53.400]   There certainly is from the hard sciences and things like that, mathematics.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.000]   And so forth.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.580]   But when it comes to philosophy, which is a way to understand the world while ignoring
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:09.260]   God or rejecting God, you get nothing but empty deception, and you get nothing but human
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.100]   ideas passed down from one person to another person.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:18.520]   And in reality, human philosophy is simplistic.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.680]   Simple is good.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.280]   Simple means it's not complicated.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.400]   Simplistic is a bad word.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:32.380]   If somebody says, "You're simplistic," that means you are not giving a reasonable response.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:39.240]   Simplistic is to underestimate the reality of something.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:47.500]   I was at camp with a thousand teenagers over in New Mexico, and the seniors got together
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.080]   and they wanted to have a question and answer session.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   It was wonderful.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.400]   I loved doing it.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.340]   Perhaps the most telling question came from - these are high school seniors.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:06.640]   They said, "What do we need to know, facing university, facing college, going forward?
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.420]   What protections should we have?"
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:20.960]   And they said, "You need two things, two things without which you will be a victim of the
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.400]   world.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.240]   You need conviction.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.720]   You need conviction.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.280]   You have to have some non-negotiables.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:38.160]   You have to have some hills you die on, and you have to know why, and you have to be able
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:45.080]   to substantiate those in the Word of God and in your own conscience.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.020]   Without convictions, you are a cork in the surf.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.480]   You'll end up wherever they take you.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.400]   You need convictions.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:22:04.140]   Your convictions are the immovable pillars of your character.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.380]   They're the structure.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:16.160]   Because what they're going to want to do in the university is crush those convictions,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.400]   because they're biblical convictions and they're true, and the world is ungodly, and the world
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.800]   is run by Satan who's a liar.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:35.880]   They're going to attack you with lies, and they're going to attack your convictions about
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:44.200]   God, about man, about sin, about righteousness, about conduct, about morality, about everything.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.140]   You have to have convictions.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:53.400]   Second thing you have to have is critical thinking, critical thinking.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.840]   And I think for this particular period of history, this is what is most under attack.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.160]   And let me tell you how to look at that.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.740]   Universities these days, certainly in the humanities side of things, universities these
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.060]   days are concerned about ideologies.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.760]   You hear a lot about that, an ideology.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.580]   What do they mean by an ideology?
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.400]   It's just another word for a philosophy.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   But ideologies in the current climate are seductive.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   They're seductive and attractive to people because they are mindless.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.760]   They are mindless.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.740]   Here's how an ideology works.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.560]   What's wrong in America?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.580]   White privilege.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.960]   What's wrong in America?
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.540]   Systemic racism.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.660]   What's wrong in America?
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.340]   Abuse of women.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.400]   They want you to buy into the fact that everything that's wrong in America
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.380]   can be explained by an ideology.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.800]   They don't want you to think critically about it.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:09.380]   The chaos of deception and lies forces you, if you want to navigate the world in which
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.040]   you live, to think critically.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.380]   Are there things wrong with capitalism?
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:20.160]   Capitalism can be abused just like socialism is abused.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.400]   Anything can be abused because sinners are engaged in it.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:31.300]   Any kind of relationships, any kind of anything in human relationships is going to have good,
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.340]   bad, and indifferent.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:38.280]   But what they want you to do is accept the "buy the package" and shut down alternative
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.960]   discussions.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.020]   That's why they cancel culture because they want you to buy the ideology.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.300]   They don't want you to think critically.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:53.400]   We think critically because we think biblically, and we have the mind of Christ.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.720]   It's 2:16, "You have the mind of Christ."
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:05.560]   I don't want to get caught up in philosophy, which is another term for human wisdom.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.640]   I don't want to get caught up in empty deception.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.780]   I don't want to get caught up in something just passed down from person to person in
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.020]   tradition.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:20.080]   And I certainly want to get above the stupid level of the ABCs.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.400]   You can't reduce me to some simplistic moron.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.180]   I'm not going to get into that.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:34.660]   Human wisdom is infantile compared to divine wisdom.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.900]   So look at verse 9, Colossians 2.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:47.220]   Look, we don't pay any attention to that, but we pay attention to Christ, "For in Him
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:53.400]   all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form, and in Him you have been made," what?
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   Complete.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.180]   Everything we need is in Christ.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.900]   First Corinthians 2:16, "We have the mind of Christ."
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.280]   We have the mind of Christ.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:12.600]   So I told those high school students, convictions, critical thinking.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.100]   Think like a Christian.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.480]   Think like Christ.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.720]   Think biblically.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.400]   Don't be kidnapped by lies.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:31.060]   Father, we're grateful beyond comprehension for all that is ours in Christ.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.520]   And may the Word of Christ dwell in us richly.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.220]   Help us to search deeply into the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which are all hidden
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.880]   in Him.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.840]   Don't let us get seduced.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:53.400]   Don't let us get kidnapped by human philosophy and deception.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:01.720]   Don't let us get seduced by human philosophy, human tradition, simplistic ideas designed
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.460]   to deceive.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.480]   May we think biblically.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.020]   Grant us wisdom.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:20.880]   Grant us full understanding of the revelation that gives us the knowledge of Christ.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.400]   Help us to think like Him.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:31.880]   As we allow His Word to dwell in us richly and are changed into His image from one level
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.700]   of glory to the next.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.700]   That's our prayer.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.920]   In His name, amen.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:46.320]   The life of Christ transcends the past, the present, the future, and is the theme of all
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.740]   Scripture.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:53.400]   Pastor John has spent more than half of his 50-plus years preaching in the Gospels, four
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.480]   books dedicated to Christ's life.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:02.160]   The book One Perfect Life blends the Gospel accounts into a single narrative and is available
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.700]   for purchase today by giving us a call at 888-57-GRACE.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:13.080]   That's 888-57-GRACE or online through our website, gty.org.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.560]   On behalf of John MacArthur and all of us at the ministry, thanks for joining us today
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.560]   in the study of our great Savior.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.540]   We'll see you next time on Grace To You.
