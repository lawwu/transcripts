[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.960]   And in this episode, I want to go through a thought process on why Silicon Valley Bank
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:17.320]   would buy 10-year bonds yielding 1.69% back in 2021 and maybe in early 2022.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.920]   Because here in 2023, I've been talking about buying Treasury bills, which are Treasury
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.640]   bonds with a one-year duration or earlier, three months, six months, nine months, or
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.040]   one year at about 5% to 5.15%.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.000]   And it's probably going to go a little bit higher.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.720]   I think T-bills at 5% plus is kind of a no-brainer.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.520]   You just buy them risk-free, no state or local income taxes, and you just wait until the
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.320]   carnage finishes unfolding, right?
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.460]   T-billing and chilling is the new term.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.800]   And I haven't talked much at all about buying 10-year Treasury bonds, let alone five years.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.280]   I talked briefly about three-year, buying three-year Treasury bonds a couple of months
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.120]   ago when they were yielding 4%.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.440]   But now, OK, 10-year Treasury bonds yield about 4%.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.560]   Actually, they did yield about 4%.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.640]   Now, after the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, they're yielding now about 3.65%, 3.7%.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.000]   So if we are not that enthused about buying longer-dated Treasury bonds at 4%, 3.5%, 4%,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.680]   4.5% at one point, why on earth would Silicon Valley Bank buy 10-year Treasury bonds yielding
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.180]   only about 1.7%?
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920]   We can all armchair quarterback and think, well, that was silly because that was near
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.640]   the top of the market.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.160]   And obviously, when rates rise aggressively, bond values decline.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.400]   And if you have to sell those Treasury bonds before maturity, you're going to lose money.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.900]   I'm also looking at the archives, the Financial Samurai post archives and the episodes.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.560]   And I don't see any posts or episodes talking about buying 10-year Treasury bonds when they're
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.520]   yielding 0.56%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.260]   Because at that time, I think we were all discussing, well, that's where bond yields
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.800]   really have nowhere to go but up.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.360]   They could stay low.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.120]   But at that point, OK, look, the risk-reward of buying bonds when they're yielding under
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.800]   1% didn't seem that great.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.880]   So instead, we did talk about buying stocks in real estate.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.640]   You remember a post called "How to Predict the Stock Market Bottom Like Nostradamus."
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.600]   We talked about taking advantage of real estate opportunities during COVID-19.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.760]   And you can see the archives of these posts and my thought process about taking advantage
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.280]   during a difficult time period.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.460]   So back to Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.160]   Why would they do so?
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.400]   They employ smart people.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.760]   They get paid tons and tons of money.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.280]   Well, it's essentially because they weren't buying these Treasury bonds with their money.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.400]   It was other people's money.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.000]   It was their depositors' money.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.080]   And the depositors were getting paid from Silicon Valley Bank probably an interest rate
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.640]   of less than, let's say, 1%.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.720]   We all remember when we were getting 0.1% to 0.5% on our money market accounts.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.800]   So if you are a depositor at Silicon Valley Bank or any of these banks in 2020, 2021,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.400]   you're probably getting less than a 1% interest rate.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.600]   Heck, I even just moved money to a short-term CD at Chase Bank, which is where my small
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.640]   business has a relationship, because we were only getting 0.2%.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.720]   So back then, I'm sure Silicon Valley Bank were paying depositors less than 1%.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.120]   So if you then buy Treasury bonds yielding 1.69%, you have a positive net interest margin,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.380]   a spread of at least 0.7%, maybe higher.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.940]   And then the question is, why wouldn't Silicon Valley Bank better match duration?
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.000]   So these deposits are considered short-term deposits.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.680]   They're very liquid, used for working capital needs, used to buy a house, buy a boat, pay
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.460]   employees and so forth.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.240]   So why would Silicon Valley Bank buy 10-year Treasuries?
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.040]   That's a mismatch in duration.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.680]   And the simple answer is that 10-year Treasury bond yields were higher than 5-year, 3-year,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.760]   1-year.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.140]   So the bank thought, well, let's invest in this duration to make more money.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.020]   It's always about money, folks.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.140]   But it's also about making risk-adjusted investments, risk-appropriate investments.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.520]   And so as the Fed started raising rates, the Fed funds rate is the shortest duration.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.640]   It's like an overnight banking rate.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.980]   Deposit rates started to go up.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.080]   So the cost of funding started going up for Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.900]   And so if you lock in a 1.69% rate for 10 years, and your cost of deposits now balloons
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.840]   to, let's say, 4%, 4.2%, 4.5% now, that's what we see at many of the competing banks,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   then you're upside down.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.320]   You have a negative net interest margin.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.860]   You're losing money.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.880]   And then if you don't get as many deposits, there becomes this shortfall.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.700]   And the shortfall will result in-- it's almost like a Ponzi scheme, right?
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.280]   Because no bank has all of its deposits money available to its depositors, right?
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.240]   The bank will have a tier 1 capital ratio of between 12% to 14%.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.680]   There'll be some tier 2 capital.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.120]   And then the rest is lent out to make a profit.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.800]   That's banking 101.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.260]   So in retrospect, if you have a time machine, you would have told the investment committee
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.280]   at Silicon Valley Bank not to invest half their deposits in 10-year treasury bonds.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.680]   You better match liability duration, let's say, three months, six months, one year.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.820]   So what would happen is your profits would be smaller.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.320]   Your stock price would probably not be as high.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.960]   And nobody likes that, right?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.880]   Everybody wants to make more money.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.000]   So if you're going to take this excess risk, and you're going to see the rewards of a higher
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.800]   stock price, you would then rationally sell as the stock would go to the moon.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.780]   And then you would try to distance yourself as it collapses because the Fed raised rates
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:49.120]   more aggressively and more quickly than anticipated, collapsing your hold to maturity bonds.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.600]   Silicon Valley planned to hold these 10-year bonds to maturity for 10 years and just earn
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.300]   1.69%.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.040]   But then they had to sell to raise liquidity because it was facing a liquidity crunch,
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.240]   especially after it announced it had tried to raise $3 billion from the public market
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.280]   and couldn't.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.560]   And therefore, the bank run accelerated.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.700]   In conclusion, let's talk about some key takeaways.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.840]   Takeaway number one, if you are investing other people's money, you're going to be willing
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.480]   to take more risk.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.040]   It's just the way it is.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.400]   It's human nature.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.800]   But if you're investing your own money, which is what I do to help keep my family afloat
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.280]   so my wife and I don't have to go back to work, it is much different, more conservative,
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.100]   more thoughtful, less risky.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:47.360]   So please be careful listening to other people's investment advice, especially if they're talking
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.160]   about investing other people's money.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.920]   If you look at Wall Street strategists, they strategize about target prices and everything.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.060]   But it's not their money, so they can talk about anything and there's really no repercussions
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.940]   except for maybe their reputation and their salary and bonus.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.440]   So if you go down the chain and you start listening to pontificators on social media,
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.060]   well, there's really no repercussions, especially if they are-- it's the funny thing where people
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.160]   talk about making money investing.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.600]   Well, if you're so good at making money investing, why are you trying to pump people up with
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.820]   your investing course and all that stuff?
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.160]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.200]   But it does make sense because it's more profitable to sell the dream about how to be a great
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.760]   investor than to just invest your own money.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:43.360]   The second takeaway is that very smart and connected people still get things wrong.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.280]   The CEO of Silicon Valley Bank was a director at the San Francisco Fed.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.480]   So presumably, he had conversations with other Fed officials and was more plugged in than
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.920]   the rest of us.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.940]   But if he was more plugged in than the rest of us, why would he green light the decision
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:07.800]   to buy 10-year bonds yielding 1.69% in 2021?
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   I really think most of us back then-- this is not revisionist history because I'm looking
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.280]   at the history.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.400]   Most of us did not want to buy bonds because they were yielding so low.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   The risk reward was not there.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.780]   So I think it's really important that before we invest a single dollar, to talk to someone
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.340]   else with an opposing point of view, to look at the other side.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.040]   If we were always right on our investments, we'd all be multimillionaires or billionaires
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.040]   by now.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:43.260]   Obviously, we're not because something unexpected or something we didn't believe always tends
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.260]   to happen.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.720]   This is the nature of the beast when we put money into risk assets.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.080]   And we have to accept that.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.640]   A third takeaway is to look at the yield curve.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.760]   The yield curve right now is inverted.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.360]   It's the most inverted since the 1980s.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.920]   And this is an indicator of another recession within the next 12 to 18 months.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.440]   And if you lost your job already, it's already a recession.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.680]   It might be a depression.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.120]   Hopefully not.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   But this is the thing.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.460]   If the yield curve is inverted, you don't want to borrow short and lend long.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.560]   This is what Silicon Valley Bank did.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.720]   They borrowed short by paying, paying their depositors a high interest rate.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.800]   It's inverted, right?
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.580]   The short end is more expensive than the long end.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.660]   And then they're lending money.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:35.320]   They're trying to make money on the long end, which is paying a lower interest rate or a
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.800]   lower return.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.900]   So therefore, they're upside down, negative net interest margin.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:49.520]   On the flip side, for all of us who wisely refinanced our mortgages in 2021 and 2022,
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.080]   we were on the other side of the Silicon Valley Bank trade of spending $90 to $100 billion
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.300]   buying 10-year bond yields, yielding 1.7%.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.700]   We were able to borrow long and then sell short.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.860]   And since we're not a bank, we're not really selling short.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.200]   We're just enjoying our home now.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.920]   So that's the short.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.480]   A fourth takeaway from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse is the risk of working at a
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   startup.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.240]   I never thought about this risk before, how the working capital can just get frozen up
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.840]   in a bank that's been around for 40 years.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.900]   And it's been a great partner to many, many thousands of startups in the ecosystem.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:37.440]   But working at a startup, you face a much higher risk profile than working at an established
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.160]   firm with very strong profitability and cash flow.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   I do question the narrative that if Silicon Valley Bank funds are not released ASAP, that
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.720]   the entire startup ecosystem will fail because companies won't be able to meet payroll and
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.400]   will have to lay off or furlough workers.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.560]   The thing is, if you're a worker, is missing one paycheck really going to devastate your
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   finances?
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.520]   I hope not, especially if you're a financial samurai listener and reader.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.040]   I am hopeful that there's going to be resolution and there's going to be a large acquire of
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.400]   Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:18.560]   And we'll find out pretty soon who will make depositors who have over $250,000 at the bank
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   hole.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:26.480]   In such a scenario, you volunteering two weeks more of your time to work and then ultimately
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.720]   getting paid will come out making you look pretty good.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.080]   You're going to look pretty loyal.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.480]   You're going to look like you're part of the team, brothers and sisters in arms.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.600]   And if you don't end up getting paid, which is the lower probability scenario, then you
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.320]   will have ended up wasting time, the ability to make some side hustle money.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.560]   But your reputation as a strong team player will live on.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.600]   People don't forget this, especially during times of crisis.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.940]   And that will be helpful for your next job, your next career, your next opportunity.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:05.320]   The final takeaway from this whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse is that we shouldn't
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.240]   depend on the government to save us.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:15.080]   Even though the FDIC has stepped in to receive Silicon Valley Bank and guarantee those depositors
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:22.440]   with up to $250,000, we should not rely on anybody to achieve financial independence
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.080]   and to bail us out if we are in trouble.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:30.340]   I remember Monday, September 15, 2008, very clearly.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.340]   Just like now.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.340]   It's very interesting.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.640]   Just like now, there was a lot of smoke and fire about whether Lehman would survive the
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.920]   weekend.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.280]   And I bet my neighbor, my colleague, Will, $100, saying that, of course, the government
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.940]   was going to bail out Lehman.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.600]   How could they let contagion continue?
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.480]   And then, of course, on Monday, the government let Lehman fail.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.260]   And then Lehman failed, and then the contagion spread, and what resulted in a terrible collapse
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.600]   in the financial markets and the real estate market.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.640]   It was a clear wake-up call back then to never rely on the government to save you.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:16.020]   Financial Samurai was born in July 2009 at the bottom of the global financial crisis.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.920]   If there was not a global financial crisis, the site would never have been born.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.960]   This podcast would never have been started.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.640]   So that's a bright side for you as listeners and readers if you enjoy this work.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.720]   And for me as someone who sought financial freedom, this pain that I felt during the
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.600]   global financial crisis motivated me to change.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.440]   Before the financial crisis, I just sucked up dealing with all the stress and pain and
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.640]   long hours because I wanted to climb the corporate ladder and make more money.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.340]   And then when the financial crisis hit and I realized the government wouldn't save me
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:58.000]   or my colleagues or the industry, I realized I needed to find and develop contingency plans.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.600]   I couldn't just rely on my job, one income source to survive and to gain financial independence
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   eventually.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:12.400]   I needed to develop alternative income streams, more passive income investments, a side hustle,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.200]   a side business, whatever it is.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   I needed to do whatever it took so that I would be secure and my future family would
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.640]   be secure as well.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   So if you're feeling some pain from the Silicon Valley bank collapse, embrace it, accept it,
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.040]   and use it as motivation to change for the better.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.400]   All right, everybody.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.560]   It's Saturday morning, March 11th, 2023.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.260]   I got to get out of bed to feed the kids and take the kids to a birthday play date.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.960]   Let's hope for the best.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.880]   Let's hope there is a positive resolution in the coming week where all depositors, innocent
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.600]   depositors get made whole.
