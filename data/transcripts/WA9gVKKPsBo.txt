[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   The following is a conversation with Jordan Jonas,
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.920]   winner of "Alone" season six,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.300]   a show where the task is to survive alone
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.800]   in the Arctic wilderness longer than anyone else.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.120]   He is widely considered to be one of,
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.280]   if not the greatest competitors on that show.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.560]   He has a fascinating life story
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.920]   that took him from a farm in Idaho
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.560]   and hoboing on trains across America
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.440]   to traveling with nomadic tribes in Siberia.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.960]   All that helped make him into a world-class explorer,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.120]   survivor, hunter, wilderness guide,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.880]   and most importantly, a great human being
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   with a big heart and a big smile.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.200]   This was a truly fun and fascinating conversation.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.000]   Let me also mention that at the end, after the episode,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.320]   I'll start answering some questions
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.400]   and will try to articulate my thinking
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.360]   on some top-of-mind topics.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.880]   So if that's of interest to you,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.080]   keep listening after the episode is over.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.880]   This is "Alex Rubin Podcast."
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.720]   To support it,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.360]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.680]   And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Jonas.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.200]   You won "Alone" season six,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.400]   and I think are still considered to be one of,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.040]   if not the most successful survivor on that show.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   So let's go back.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.600]   Let's look at the big picture.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.080]   Can you tell me about the show "Alone"?
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.120]   How does it work?
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.480]   - Yeah, it's a show where they take 10 individuals
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.720]   and each person gets 10 items off of the list.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.880]   You know, basic items would be an ax, a saw, a frying pan,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.760]   you know, some pretty basic stuff.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.440]   And then they send 'em all,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.280]   drop 'em off all in the woods with a few cameras.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   And so the people are actually alone.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.640]   There's not a crew or anything.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.080]   And then you basically live there as long as you can,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.920]   you know, and so the person that lasts the longest,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.840]   you know, once the second place person taps out,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.600]   they come and get you and that individual wins.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   So it's a pretty legit challenge.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.800]   You know, they drop you off,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.080]   helicopter flies out,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.000]   and you're not gonna get your next meal
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.320]   until you make it happen, so.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.480]   - So you have to figure out the shelter,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.120]   you have to figure out the source of food,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.520]   and then it gets colder and colder
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.280]   'cause I guess they drop you out in a moment
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160]   where it's going into the winter.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.480]   - Yeah, they typically do it in temperate,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.240]   colder climates, things like that.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.920]   And they start in September, October,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.080]   so the time's ticking when they drop you off.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.140]   And yeah, the pressure's on.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.600]   You know, you get overwhelmed with all the things
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.680]   you have to do right away.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.520]   Like, oh man, I'm not gonna eat again
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.960]   until I actually shoot or catch something.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.040]   Gotta build a shelter.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.400]   It's pretty overwhelming.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.160]   Figure your whole location out,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.200]   but it's interesting 'cause once you're there
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.160]   a little while, you kind of get into a,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.440]   well, at least for me I did.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.960]   There was like a week, or maybe not a week,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.520]   but that I was kind of a little more annoyed with things.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.680]   You know, it's like, oh, my sight sucks, sucks.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.280]   And then you kind of accept it.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.560]   Like, you know what, it is what it is.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.240]   No amount of complaining's gonna do anybody any good,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.680]   so I'm just gonna make it happen.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.520]   And so then, or, you know, do my best to.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.280]   And then I felt like I got in a zone
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.720]   and I felt like I was right back in kind of Siberia
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.880]   or in that head space,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.720]   and I found I actually really enjoyed it.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.040]   I'd been a little bit out of, I guess you'd call it,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.280]   the game 'cause I had had a child,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.680]   and so when we had our daughter,
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.180]   we came back to the States,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.140]   and then a bunch of things happened,
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.800]   and I just ended up, we didn't end up going back to Russia.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.200]   So it'd been a couple years that I was just,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.880]   you know, we were raising the little girl and boy, then.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.120]   - So you've gotten a little soft.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.940]   - So I was like, "Did I get a little soft?"
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.280]   (laughing)
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.000]   But then it was fun how after just some days there,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.880]   I was like, "Oh man, I feel like I'm at home now."
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.480]   And then it was like, you're kind of in that flow state.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.760]   - Actually, there's a few moments
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000]   like when you left the ladder up or with the moose
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.960]   that you kind of screwed up a little bit.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.800]   - Oh yeah.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.680]   - How do you go from that moment of frustration
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.400]   to the moment of acceptance?
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.280]   - I mean, the more you put yourself in life
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.880]   in positions that are kind of outside your comfort zone
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.100]   or push your abilities,
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.040]   the more often you're gonna screw up.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.480]   And then the more opportunity you have to learn from that.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   And then, to be honest, it's kind of funny,
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.920]   but you almost get to a position
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.280]   where you don't feel that uncomfortable.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.400]   It's not unexpected.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.920]   You kind of expect you're gonna mess up here and there.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.960]   I remember particularly with the moose,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.040]   the first moose I saw, I had a great shot at it,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.740]   but I had a hard time judging distance
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.200]   because it was in a mud flat,
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   which means it's hard to tell yardage.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.360]   'Cause you're usually typically going by trees or markers,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.800]   be like, "Oh, I'm probably 30 yards away."
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.920]   This was a giant moose, and he was 40-something yards away.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.320]   And I estimated that he was 30-something yards away,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.920]   so I was way off and shot and dropped between his legs.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.960]   And then I realized I had not grabbed my quiver,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.160]   so I only had one shot,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.940]   and I just watched him turn around and walk off.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.040]   But I was struck initially with like...
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.680]   I actually noticed how unmad I was.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.280]   I was like, "Oh, this is actually..."
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.320]   I was like, "That was awesome."
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.520]   That was like seeing a dinosaur.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.360]   That was really cool.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.600]   And then I was like, "Oh, what an idiot.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.440]   "How'd I miss?"
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.560]   But then I was like...
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.440]   But it made me that much more determined
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.000]   to make it happen again.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.580]   It was like, "Okay, nobody's gonna make this happen
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.040]   "except myself.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.880]   "Can't complain.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.700]   "It wouldn't have done me any good
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.300]   "to go back and mope about it."
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.080]   And so then I had a thought.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.180]   I was like, "Oh, I remember the native guys telling me
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.200]   "they used to build these giant fences
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.680]   "and funnel game into certain areas and stuff."
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.480]   And I was like, "Man, that's a lot of calories,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.440]   "but I have to make that happen again now."
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.520]   So I kinda went out there and tried that,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.800]   and that was kind of an attempt at something, too.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.120]   It could have failed or not worked,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.280]   but sure enough, it worked.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.000]   And the opportunity came again.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.440]   The moose came wandering along,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.000]   and I was able to get it.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120]   But being able to take failure,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.080]   as soon as you can, the better.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.000]   Accept it and then learn from it
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.020]   is kind of a muscle you have to exercise a little bit.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.360]   - Well, it's interesting, 'cause in this case,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.920]   the cost of failure is like,
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.760]   you're not gonna be able to eat.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.860]   - Yeah, that was really interesting.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.560]   I mean, the most interesting thing about that show
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.280]   was how high the stakes felt.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.480]   'Cause it didn't feel, you know,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.160]   you didn't tell yourself you're on a show.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.000]   At least I didn't.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.300]   You just felt like you're gonna starve to death
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.300]   if you don't make this happen, so.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.200]   The stakes felt so high.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.840]   And it was an interesting thing to tap into,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.680]   because, I mean, so many of our ancestors
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.400]   probably all just dealt with that on a regular basis,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.960]   but it's something that we're,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.560]   all the modern amenities and such,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.640]   and food security that we don't deal with.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.040]   And it was interesting to tap into
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   what a kind of a peak mental experience that is,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.520]   when you really, really need something to survive,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.000]   and then it happens, it's, you can't imagine.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.720]   I mean, that's what our, all our dopamine
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.320]   and receptors are tuned for that experience in particular.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.420]   So it was, yeah, it was pretty awesome,
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.480]   but the pressure felt very on.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   Like, I always felt the pressure of providing or starving.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.120]   - And then there's the situation
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.080]   when you left the ladder up.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.560]   - Right. - And you needed fat,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.920]   and what is it, the ovary needs some of the fat.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.600]   - Right, yeah, well, it was,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.120]   when I got the moose, I was so happy.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.320]   The most joy I could almost experience maxed out.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.720]   But I didn't think I,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.400]   I didn't think I won at that point.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.720]   I never thought like, oh, that's my ticket to victory.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.280]   I thought, holy crap, it's gonna be me
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.080]   against somebody else that gets a moose now,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.040]   and we're gonna be here six, eight months,
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.920]   who knows how long.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.080]   And so I can't be here six, eight months and still lose.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.420]   So I've gotta like,
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.720]   I've gotta out-produce somebody else with a moose.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.720]   So I had all that in my head.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.680]   And I already was, of course, pretty thin.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.040]   And so I was just like, man,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.160]   if somebody else gets a moose, I'm still gonna be behind.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.080]   And so everything felt like precious to me.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   And then I had found a plastic jug,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.920]   and I put a whole bunch of the moose's fat
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.800]   in this plastic jug and set it up on a little shelf.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.360]   And I thought, ah, you know what, if a bear comes,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.600]   I'll probably hear it, and I'll come out
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.700]   and be able to shoot it.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.280]   So I went to sleep, and I woke up the next morning,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.360]   and I went out, and I was like, where's that jug?
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.040]   And then I was like, wait a second,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.060]   what are all these prints?
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.720]   And then I started looking around.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.440]   And it took a second to dawn on me
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.760]   'cause I haven't interacted with wolverines
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.800]   very often in life.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.440]   And I was like, oh, those are wolverine tracks.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.660]   And he was just so much sneakier
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.280]   than a bear would have been or something.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.400]   So it kind of surprised me.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.720]   And he took off with that jug of fat.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.000]   And so then I went from feeling pretty good about myself
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.420]   to like, now I'm losing again against whoever,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.160]   you know, this other person is with a moose.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.960]   So I, again, kind of the pressure came back to,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.400]   oh, no, I gotta produce again.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.440]   You know, it wasn't the end of the world.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.200]   And I think they may have exaggerated a little bit
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.080]   how little fat I had left.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.120]   You know, I still had, a moose has a lot of fat.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.520]   But it did make me feel like I was at a disadvantage again.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.640]   And so, yeah, that was pretty intense
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.560]   'cause those wolverines, they're bold little animals.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.280]   And he was basically saying, no, this is my moose.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.080]   (laughing)
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.660]   And I had to counter his claims.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.480]   - Well, yeah, they're really, really smart.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.280]   They figure out a way to get to places really effectively.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.480]   Wolverines are like fascinating in that way.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.200]   So let's go to that happy moment, the moose.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.320]   You are the first and one of the only contestants
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   to have ever killed a moose on the show,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.640]   a big game animal with a bow and arrow.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.320]   So this is day 20.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.680]   So can you take me through the kill?
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.360]   - Yeah, so I'd missed one and I just decided
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.080]   I'm not here to starve.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.540]   I'm here to try to become sustainable.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.180]   So I was like, I don't care if it's a risk,
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.240]   I'm gonna build that fence.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.460]   I built it.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.780]   I would just pick berries and call moose every day.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.400]   And it was actually really pleasant
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.440]   to sit in a berry patch and call moose.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.600]   (laughing)
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.240]   But then I also had this whole trap
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.880]   and snare line set out everywhere.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.480]   So I had all these, I was getting rabbits.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   But, and I was actually taking a rabbit out of a snare
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.980]   when I heard a clank 'cause I had set up
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.700]   kind of an alarm system with string and cans, so.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.880]   - It was a brilliant idea.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.300]   - Yeah, another thing that could have not worked,
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.140]   but it actually worked.
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.300]   (laughing)
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.620]   And it came through.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.460]   And I was like, oh, I heard the cans clank.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.300]   And I was like, no way.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.380]   And so I ran over.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.780]   I didn't know what it was exactly,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.620]   but something was coming along the fence.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.980]   And I ran over and jumped in the bush
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.220]   next to the funnel exit on the fence.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.780]   And sure enough, the big moose came running up.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.620]   And you know, your heart gets pounding like crazy.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.180]   You're just like, no way, no way.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.180]   I probably could have waited a little longer
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.140]   and had a perfect broadside shot.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.140]   But I took the shot when he was,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.820]   he was pretty close, like 24 yards.
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.740]   But he was quartering towards me,
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.780]   which makes it a little harder to make a perfect kill shot.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.160]   You know, and so I hit it and it took off running.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.720]   And I just thought, you know, I was super excited.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.580]   I couldn't believe I actually, you know,
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.400]   I was like, oh my gosh, got the moose.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.940]   I think that was a really good shot.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.460]   You get all excited.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.380]   But then it plays back in your head.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.540]   And particularly when you're first learning to hunt,
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.860]   there's always an animal that gets away, you know,
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.140]   and you like make a bad decision
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.780]   or not a great shot or something.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.260]   And it's just part of it.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.540]   And so of course you're like,
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.940]   I'm not gonna be satisfied until I see this thing.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.620]   So I followed the blood trail a little while
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.020]   and I saw some bubbly blood,
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.620]   which meant it was hitting the lungs,
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.740]   which meant it's not gonna live.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.580]   You know, you'll get it.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.900]   And so as long as you don't mess it up.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.460]   And so I went back to my shelter and waited an hour.
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.260]   I skinned that rabbit that had caught
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.540]   and then super nervous, the slowest hour ever.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.500]   And then I followed it along,
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.300]   ended up losing the blood trail.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.100]   I was like, no, no.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.500]   And then I was like, well, if there's no blood,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.100]   I'm just gonna follow the path that I would go
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.260]   if I was a moose, you know,
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.340]   like the least resistance through the woods.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.940]   So I followed kind of along the shore there
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.740]   and sure enough, I saw him up there.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.140]   I was like, oh, you know, I was so excited.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.860]   Lay down, but he hadn't died yet.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.700]   And so he just sat there and he would stand up
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.780]   and I would just like, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.580]   And he would lay back down and go, yes.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.220]   And then he would stand up and it was like that
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.660]   for a couple hours it took him.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.380]   And then finally at one point,
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.020]   you know, and a lot of people have asked like,
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.060]   why wouldn't you go finish it off?
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.740]   So when an animal like that gets hit,
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.220]   it had no idea what hit it.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.780]   You know, it just all of a sudden it's like, ah,
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.780]   something got it and it ran off and it lays down
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.500]   and it's actually fairly calm
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.540]   and it doesn't really know what's going on.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.460]   And if you can leave it in that state,
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.900]   it'll kind of bleed out and as peaceful as possible.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.380]   If you go chase after it, that's when you lose an animal
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.740]   'cause as soon as it knows it's being hunted,
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.940]   you know, it gets panicked,
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.100]   adrenaline and it can just run and run and run
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.700]   and you'll never find it.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.580]   So I didn't want it to see me.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.660]   I knew if I tried to get it with another arrow,
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.180]   there's a chance I could have finished it off,
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.320]   but there's also a not bad chance
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.140]   that it would see me take off or even attack
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.580]   'cause moose can be a little dangerous.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.340]   And so I just chose to wait it out.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.100]   And at one point it stood up and fell over
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.260]   and I could tell it had died and walked over.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.620]   Like you actually touch it and you're just like, whoa,
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.980]   no way, like that whole burden of weeks of,
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.020]   you're gonna starve, you're gonna starve.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.140]   And it got rid of that demon.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.860]   To be honest, it's one of the happiest moments of my life.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.820]   It's really hard to replicate that joy
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.260]   because it was just so, so real.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260]   You're so directly connected to your needs.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.860]   It's all so simple, you know?
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.700]   (laughs)
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.860]   It was a peak experience for sure.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.460]   - And were you worried that it would take many more hours
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.960]   than it would take it into the night?
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.800]   - Yeah, I was.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.980]   I mean, until you actually have your hands on it,
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.820]   I was worried the whole time.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.780]   It's a pretty nerve wracking period there
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.540]   between when you get it and when you actually
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.900]   recover the animal, get your hands on it.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.780]   So it took longer than I wanted, but I finally got it.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.980]   - Can you actually speak to the kill shot itself
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.460]   just for people who don't hunt?
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.300]   - Yeah, so--
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.500]   - Like what it takes to stay calm,
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.900]   to not freak out too much, to like wait,
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.020]   but not wait too long.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.540]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, another thing about hunting
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.320]   is that for every animal you get,
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.040]   you probably don't get nine or 10
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.960]   that just turned the wrong way when you were drawn back
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.440]   or went way behind a tree or you never had a clean shot
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.320]   or whatever it is.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   And so every time you can see a moment coming,
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.800]   your heart really starts beating
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.920]   and you have to breathe through it.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.440]   I can almost, you almost feel the nervousness of it.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.600]   And then you just try to stay calm.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.160]   Whatever you do, just try to stay calm,
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.660]   wait for it to come up, draw back.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.300]   You've practiced shooting a lot,
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.380]   so you have like kind of a technique.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.580]   Like I'm gonna go back, touch my face,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.020]   draw my elbow tight, and then the arrow's gonna let loose.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.100]   - It's a muscle memory.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.620]   - It's kind of muscle memory.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.540]   You have a little trigger, like draw that elbow tight,
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.460]   and then, and then it happens.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.480]   And then you just watch the arrow
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.320]   and see where it goes.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.740]   Now with the animal, you try to do it ethically.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.240]   That is like make as good of a shot as you can.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.100]   Make sure it is either hit in the heart or both lungs.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.440]   And when that happens, it's a pretty quick death,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.540]   which is, death is a part of life.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.100]   But honestly, for a wild animal,
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.220]   that's probably the best way to go they could have.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.060]   Now, when an animal's kind of walking towards you,
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.460]   if it's walking towards you, but not directly towards you,
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.060]   that's what you call quartering towards you,
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.280]   you can picture it's actually pretty difficult
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.140]   to hit both lungs because the shoulder blade
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.420]   and all that bone is in the way.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.620]   So you wanna, so you have to make a perfect shot
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.460]   to get 'em both.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.860]   And to be honest, when I took my shot,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.860]   I was a couple inches or a few inches right.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.060]   And so it went through the first lung,
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.260]   and then it sunk the arrow all the way into the moose.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.400]   But it didn't, it allowed that second lung
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.600]   to stay breathing, which meant the moose stayed alive longer.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.980]   - What's your relationship with the animal
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.300]   in a situation like that?
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.360]   You said death is a part of life.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.200]   - Yeah, that's an interesting thought
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.580]   because no matter what your relationship to,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.560]   however you choose to go through life,
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.180]   whether whatever you eat, whatever you do,
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.240]   death is a part of life.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.800]   Every animal that's out there is living off of a dead,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.260]   even plants, we're all part of this ecosystem.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.920]   I think it's really easy in a,
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.620]   particularly in an urban environment,
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.800]   but anywhere to think that we're separate
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.820]   from the ecosystem.
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.720]   But we are very much a part of it,
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   whether it be farming requires all this habitat
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.000]   to be turned into growing soybeans and da-da-da-da.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.040]   And when you get the plows and the combines,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.900]   you're losing all kinds of different animals
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.640]   and all kinds of potential habitat.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.080]   So it's not cost free.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.000]   And so when you realize that,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.360]   then you wanna produce the food
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.100]   and the things you need in an ethical manner.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.100]   So I, so for me, hunting plays a really major role in that.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.620]   Like I literally know how many animals a year
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.100]   it takes to feed my family and myself.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.100]   I actually know the exact number.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.860]   And it's like, and I know what the cost of that is.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.580]   And I'm aware of it 'cause I'm out in the woods
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.480]   and I see these like beautiful elk and moose.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.240]   And I really love the species, love the animals.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.200]   But there is a fact that one of those individuals,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.540]   is going to have to feed me.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.780]   And particularly like on a loan,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.820]   it was very heightened, that experience.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.820]   So I shot that one animal and I was so, so thankful
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.380]   that I wanted to give that big guy a hug
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.780]   and like, hey, sorry, it was you, but had to be somebody.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.260]   - Yeah, there's that picture of you just almost hugging it.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.440]   - Right, right, totally.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.260]   - And you can also think about the calories,
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.700]   the protein, the fat, all of that,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.460]   that comes from that, that will feed you.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.220]   - Right, you're so grateful for it.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.780]   Like the gratitude is like, you know, definitely there.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.780]   - What about the bow and arrow perspective?
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.980]   - Well, when you hunt with a bow,
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.100]   you just get so much more up close to the animals.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.920]   You know, you can't just get it from 600 yards away.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.600]   You actually have to sneak in within 30 or so yards.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   And when you do that, the experiences you have are just,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.660]   they're way more dragged out.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.100]   So, you know, your heart's beating longer,
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.440]   you have to control your nerves longer.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.380]   More often than not, it doesn't go your way
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.860]   and the thing gets away and, you know,
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.300]   you've been hiking around in the woods for a week
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.020]   and then your opportunity arises and floats away.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.500]   (laughs)
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.660]   No, and then, but at the same time,
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.500]   that's the only time when you like really have
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.760]   those interactions with the animals
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.220]   where you got this bugling bull, you know,
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.040]   like tearing at the trees right in front of you
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.140]   and other cow, elk, and animals running around.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.240]   You know, you end up having really,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.940]   I don't know what I'm daring to say,
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.940]   intimate experiences with the animal just because,
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.020]   'cause you're in it, you're kind of in its world,
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.020]   you're playing its game, it has its senses to defend itself
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.120]   and you have your wit to try to get over those.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.400]   And it really becomes, you know, it's not easy,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.160]   they're not, it becomes kind of that chess game
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.440]   and those prey animals are always tuned in,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.400]   it's, you know, slightest stick,
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.100]   they're looking for wolves or for whatever it is.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.840]   So there's something really pure and fun about it.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.520]   You know, I will say that there is an aspect that is fun,
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.360]   there's no denying it.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.800]   It's like how we're, you know,
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.440]   people have been hunting forever
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.640]   and I think it speaks to that part of us somehow.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.600]   But, and I think bow hunting is probably
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.840]   the most pure form of it
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.360]   and that you get those experiences more often
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.960]   than with a rifle.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.320]   So I don't know, I enjoy it a lot
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.800]   and the way they do regulations and such,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.280]   kind of the best times to hunt are usually allowed for bow
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.760]   because they're trying to, you know,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.320]   keep it fair for the animal and such, so.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.960]   - So the distance, the close distance
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.280]   makes you more in touch with sort of
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.200]   the natural way of the predator and prey.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.400]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.000]   - You're one of the predators
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.360]   where you have to be clever, you have to be quiet,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.760]   you have to be calm, you have to, all of that.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.600]   - Yep.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.720]   - And the full challenge and the luck involved
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.560]   and the same thing as the predators do.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.440]   - Exactly, how many times do they snap a stick
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.040]   and watch 'em run off and like, "Darn, my stock was failed."
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.560]   Or, you know, so, yeah, you're just,
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.880]   you're in that, in that ecosystem.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.880]   - How'd you learn to shoot the bow?
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.480]   - Yeah, I didn't grow up hunting.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.960]   I grew up in an area that a lot of people hunted,
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.560]   but my dad wasn't really into it
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.440]   and so I never got into it until,
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.200]   until I lived in Russia with the natives.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.240]   It was just such a part of everything we did
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.400]   and a part of our life that when I came back,
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.920]   I got a bow and I started doing archery in Virginia.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.120]   They had, it was a pretty easy way to hunt
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.200]   'cause the deer were overpopulated
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.400]   and you could get these urban archery permits.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.960]   So you'd go out and, you know, every couple days
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.600]   you'd have an opportunity to shoot a deer
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.360]   that they needed population control
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.360]   and so there were a lot of 'em
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.320]   and it gave you a lot of opportunities to learn quickly.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.520]   So that's what got me into it
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.760]   and then I found I really enjoyed it.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.040]   - Do you practice with a target also or just practice out?
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.480]   - Oh no, I would definitely practice with a target a lot.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.640]   You wanna, again, you kinda have an obligation
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.520]   to do your best 'cause you don't wanna be flinging arrows
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.720]   into like the leg of an animal
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.800]   and it's a cool way, honestly,
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.840]   to provide quality meat for the family.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.520]   You know, it's all raised naturally and wild and free
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.240]   until you bring it home into the freezer, so.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.200]   - So if we step back, what are the 10 items you brought
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.860]   and what's actually the challenge
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.640]   of figuring out which items to bring?
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.880]   - Yeah, the challenge is that you don't exactly know
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.280]   what your site's opportunities are gonna be.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.920]   So you don't really know, should I bring a fishing net?
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.960]   Am I gonna even have a spot to net or not?
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.480]   And things like that.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   I brought a axe, a saw, a Leatherman Wave,
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:06.320]   a ferro rod, this is like a, makes sparks to start a fire,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   a frying pan, a sleeping bag, a fishing kit,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.340]   a bow and arrow, trapping wire, and paracord.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.720]   And so those are my 10 items.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.480]   - Is there any regrets, any?
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.640]   - No major regrets.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.200]   I took the saw, kind of.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.560]   I thought it would be more of a calorie saver
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.680]   than I, I didn't really need it.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.080]   In hindsight, if I was doing, you know, season seven
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.840]   instead of six and got to watch, I would have taken the net
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.880]   'cause I just planned to make a net,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.080]   but I would have rather just had two nets,
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.800]   brought one, and left the saw
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.160]   because in the northern woods in particular,
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.560]   every tree's, you know, the size of your arm or leg,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.000]   you can chop it down with an axe in a couple swings.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.080]   Yeah, yeah, you don't really need the saw.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.280]   And so it was handy at times and useful,
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.700]   but I think it was my, if I had to do nine items,
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.640]   I would have been just fine without the saw.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.480]   - So two nets would just expand your--
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.400]   - Food gathering potential.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.440]   - And then in terms of trapping,
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.360]   you were okay with just the little you brought?
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.240]   - The snare wire was good.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.720]   I ran some, you know, I put out, I used all my snare wire.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.640]   I ran trap line, which is just a series of traps
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.320]   through the woods and brush every place you see sign,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.200]   put a snare, put a little mark on the tree
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.400]   so I knew where that snare was
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.440]   and just make these paths through the woods.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.640]   And I put out, you know, I don't know how many,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.560]   150, 200 snares, so every day I'd get a rabbit
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.600]   or two out of 'em.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   And then, I had a lot of rabbits, but once I got the moose,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.520]   I actually took all those snares down
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.060]   'cause I didn't wanna catch anything needlessly.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.760]   And you come to find out you can't live off of rabbits.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.840]   Man cannot live off a rabbit alone, it turns out.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.320]   - So you set up a huge number of traps.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.640]   You were also fishing and then always on the lookout
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.080]   for moose. - Yeah.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.040]   - So like, what's, in terms of survival,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.740]   if you were to do it over again,
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.080]   over and over and over and over,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.520]   like how do you maximize your chance
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.200]   of having enough food to survive for a long time?
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.300]   - You have to be really adaptable
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.960]   because everything's gonna,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.120]   it's always gonna look different,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.480]   your situation, your location.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.140]   I actually had a, what I thought was a pretty good plan
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.440]   going into a loan.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.080]   And it just, you know, the location didn't allow
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.360]   for what I thought it would.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.400]   - What was the plan?
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.760]   - Well, I thought I would just catch a bunch of fish
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.920]   'cause I'm on a really good fishing lake.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.240]   I'd catch a whole bunch of fish
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.320]   and let 'em rot for a little while
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.280]   and then just drag 'em all through the woods
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.760]   into a big pile and then hunt a bear
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.720]   on that big fish pile. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.560]   - That was the plan.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.320]   And I thought, but when I got there,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.520]   for one, I had a hard time catching fish off the bat.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.880]   You know, they didn't come like I was hoping.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.920]   And then for two, it had burned prior,
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.440]   so there were no berries.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.320]   And so, there were very few berries,
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.600]   which meant there weren't grouse, there weren't bear.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.840]   You know, they had all gone to other places
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.760]   where the berries were.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.100]   And so, what I had grown accustomed to
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.960]   kind of relying on in Siberia wasn't there, there.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.040]   You know, so in Russia, which was a similar environment,
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.200]   it was just grouse and berries and fish
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.360]   and grouse and berries and fish.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.840]   And then occasionally, you know,
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.960]   you'd get a moose or something.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.680]   But I had to reassess, which was part of me
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.080]   being grumpy at the start, like, "This place sucks."
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.280]   (laughing)
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.680]   And then, once I reassessed, and you know,
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.200]   right away I saw that there were moose tracks and such.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.840]   So, I just started to plan for that.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.760]   I moved my camp into an area that was as removed
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.720]   as I could be from where all the action is,
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.800]   where the tracks were, so that I wasn't
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.420]   disturbing animal patterns.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.400]   I made sure the wind, the predominant wind
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.420]   was blowing out my scent to sea, or you know, to the water.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.560]   And then, really, to be honest,
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.640]   if you wanna actually survive somewhere,
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.040]   it is different than alone.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.760]   But you do have to be active.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.600]   And it has to, you're gonna have to,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.720]   you're not gonna live, you're not gonna be sustainable
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.320]   by, you know, starving it out.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.280]   You'd have to unlock the key that is sustainability.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.420]   And I think there's a lot of areas
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.240]   that still have that potential,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.080]   but you have to figure out what it is.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.920]   It's usually gonna be a combination of fishing,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.600]   you know, trapping, and then hunting.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.080]   And then once you have some, the fishing and trapping
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.480]   will get you until you have some success hunting.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.320]   And then that'll buy you three or four months of time
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.720]   to continue, you know, to keep hunting again.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.420]   And you just have to roll off of that.
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.800]   But every, you know, depends on where you are,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.560]   what opportunities are there.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.840]   - So, okay, so that's the process,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.900]   fishing and trapping until you're at successful hunting.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.400]   And then the successful hunt buys you some more time.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.480]   - Mm-hmm, right, right.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.320]   - And you just go year-round.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.960]   - And then you just go year-round like that,
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.440]   and that's how people did it forever.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.560]   The pressure, I noticed that, you know,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.360]   you got that moose, and then you're happy for a week or so,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.320]   and then you start to be like, you know, this is finite.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.840]   I'm gonna have to do this again.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.360]   And imagine if you had a family that was gonna starve
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.320]   if you weren't successful, you know, this next time.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.440]   And there's just always that pressure, you know.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.400]   It made me really, like, appreciate
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.080]   the amount of what people had to deal with.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.520]   - Well, in terms of being active,
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.260]   like, so you have to do stuff all day.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.400]   So you get up-- - Get up.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.840]   - And planning. - Mm-hmm.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.580]   - Like, what am I gonna, in the midst of the frustration,
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.340]   you have to figure out, like, what's the strategy?
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.480]   Like, how do you put up all the traps?
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.160]   Is that a decision, like, you know,
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.360]   most people, like, sit at their desk
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.100]   and have, like, a calendar or whatever.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.640]   Are you, like, figuring out, like--
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.560]   - One thing about wilderness life in general
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.160]   is it's remarkably less scheduled
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.480]   than anything we deal with.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.760]   Schedules are fairly unique, too, of a modern context.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.840]   Like, you'd wake up, and you just sort of,
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.680]   you have a, you know, confluence of things you wanna do,
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.280]   things you need to do, things you should do,
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.500]   and you just kinda tackle 'em as you see fit,
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.820]   as it flows in, you know.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.540]   So, and that's actually one of the things
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.120]   that people really, that I really appreciate
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   about that lifestyle, is it really is,
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.360]   you're kind of in that flow.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.560]   And so I'd wake up and be like,
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.080]   eh, maybe I'll go fishing.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.320]   And then I'd wander over and fish.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.160]   And then I'd be like, ah, I'm gonna go check the trap line,
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.680]   add every day, if I add five or 10 snares,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.040]   you know, you're constantly adding
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.040]   to your productive potential.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.940]   And then, but nothing's really scheduled.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.640]   You're just kinda flying by the seat of your pants.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.400]   - But then there's a lot of instinct
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.080]   that's already loaded in. - Oh, there's so much, yeah.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.780]   - Like, you already, just, like, wisdom
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.120]   from all the times you've had to do it before.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.920]   That you're just actually operating a lot on instinct.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.440]   Like you said, where to find, to place the shelter.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.840]   Like, how hard is that calculation,
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.240]   where to place the shelter?
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.600]   - If you're, like, dropped off,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.240]   and this is all new to you, of course,
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.560]   all those things are gonna be things
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.520]   you have to really think through and plan.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.840]   When you're thinking about a shelter,
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.080]   you have to think of, oh, here's a nice flat spot.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.040]   You know, that's a good place.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.760]   But also, is there firewood nearby?
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.900]   And if I'm gonna be here for months,
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.760]   is there enough firewood that I'm not gonna be walking
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.080]   a half a mile to get a dry piece of wood?
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.000]   Is the water nearby?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.240]   Is there, is it somewhat open,
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.960]   but also protected from the elements?
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.600]   'Cause sometimes you get a beautiful spot.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.760]   Oh, this is great, on a calm day.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.880]   And then the wind comes, like, (imitates wind)
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.680]   And so, there's all these factors.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.920]   You know, even down to taking in what game
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.600]   is doing in the area also,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   and how that relates to where your shelter is.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.800]   - You said you have to consider where the action will be,
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.040]   and you wanna be away from the action,
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.200]   but close enough to it.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   - To see it, yeah, you wanna be, yeah, right.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.760]   And so, ideally, you know, it depends.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.160]   You're always gonna make give and takes.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.520]   And one thing with shelters,
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.080]   and location selection and stuff,
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.920]   that's another thing.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.160]   You just have to trust your ability to adapt
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.600]   in that situation, because everybody has a particular,
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.440]   you know, you got an idea of a shelter you're gonna build.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.200]   But then you get there, and maybe there's a good cliff
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.600]   that you can incorporate, you know,
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.880]   or maybe, and then you just become creative.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.840]   And that's a really fun process, too,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.360]   to just allow your creativity to try to flourish.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   - What kind of shelters are there?
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.760]   - There's all kinds of philosophies in shelters,
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.400]   which is fun.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.640]   It's fun to see people try different things.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.800]   Mine was fairly basic for the simple reason
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.000]   that I'd lived, you know, winters,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.280]   through winters in Siberia in a teepee.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.640]   So I knew I didn't need, like, anything too robust.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.480]   As long as I had calories, I'd be warm,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.320]   and I wasn't particularly worried about the cold.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.960]   But you'll see.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.560]   So I kept my shelter really pretty simple
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   with the idea that I built a simple A-frame type shelter,
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.520]   and then most of my energy's gonna be focused
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.600]   on getting calories.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.800]   And then, of course, there's always gonna be downtime.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.600]   And in that downtime, I can tweak, modify,
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.680]   improve my shelter, and that'll just be a constant process
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.380]   that by the time you're there, a few months,
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.920]   you'll have all the kinks worked out.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.640]   It'll be a really nice little setup.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.480]   But you don't have to start with that, necessarily,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.920]   'cause you got other needs you gotta focus on.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.500]   That said, you'll see a lot of people on a loan
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.280]   that really focus on, you know, building the log cabin,
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.920]   'cause they wanna be secure,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.640]   or incorporating, you know, whatever the earth has around,
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.160]   whether it be rocks, or whether it be digging a hole.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.960]   You know, and we've seen some really cool shelters,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.920]   and I'm not gonna knock it.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   Everybody's got, there's all these different strokes
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.760]   for different folks.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.400]   But my particular idea was to keep it fairly simple,
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.360]   improve it with time, but spend most of my energy.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.320]   You know, the shelter you really need to think about,
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.960]   it can't be smoky, 'cause that'll be miserable.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.040]   But it is nice to have a fire inside,
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.560]   so you need to have a fire inside
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.820]   that's not gonna be dangerous, and smoke-free.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.320]   And then also airtight,
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.040]   because you're never gonna have a warm shelter out there,
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.540]   'cause you don't have seals and things like that.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.880]   But as long as the air's not moving through it,
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.040]   you can have a warm enough shelter.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.880]   - With a fire.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.760]   - With a fire, and dryer socks, and stuff.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.120]   - How do you get the smoke out of the shelter?
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.480]   - If you have good clay, and mud, and rock,
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.000]   you can build yourself a fireplace,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.280]   which is surprisingly not that hard.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.120]   - Oh, really?
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.960]   - Yeah, it's a fun thing to do, it works well.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.000]   You take a little hole, start stacking rocks around it,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.860]   make sure it's opening, and it actually works.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.840]   So that's not as hard as you might think.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:32.880]   For me, where I was, I kind of came up with it
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.160]   as I was there with my A-frame.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.920]   I hadn't built an A-frame shelter like that before,
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.840]   and so when I built it, and then I had put a bunch
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.440]   of tin cans in the ground so that air would get the fire,
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.660]   so it was fed by air, which helps create a draft.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.000]   But I realized in an A-frame, it really doesn't,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.720]   the smoke doesn't go out very well,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.160]   even if you leave a hole at the top,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.360]   it collects and billows back down.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.600]   So then I cut some of my tarp, and made this,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.800]   and cut a hole in the A-frame,
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.760]   and then I made a hood vent that I could pull down
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.240]   and catch the smoke with, and so while the fire was going,
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.960]   it would just billow out the hood vent,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.000]   and then when it was done burning,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.840]   and it was just hot coals, I could close it,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.560]   seal it up, and keep the heat in.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.120]   So it actually worked pretty well.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.080]   - So start with something that kind of works,
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.000]   and then keep improving. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   - I always wonder, I mean, the log cabin,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.800]   it feels like that's a thing that takes
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.600]   a huge amount of work before it worked.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.960]   - The difference between a log cabin and a warm log cabin
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.200]   is like an immense amount of work,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.080]   and all the chinking, and all the door sealing,
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.760]   and the chimney has to be, anyway,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.160]   so otherwise it's just gonna be
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.240]   the same ambient temperature as outside.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   So I don't think alone's the proper context for a log cabin.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.680]   I think like a log cabin's great as a hunting cabin,
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.880]   as you know, if you're gonna have something for years,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.840]   but in a three, six month scenario,
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.840]   I don't know that it's worth the calorie expenditure.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.680]   - And it is a lot of calories.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.160]   That's an interesting sort of metaphor
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.920]   of just like get something that works.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.400]   You see a lot of this with companies,
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.160]   like successful companies, they get a prototype,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.520]   get a system that's working, and then improve fast
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.000]   in response to the conditions, to the environment.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.360]   - Yeah, 'cause it's constantly changing.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.680]   - And you end up being a lot better
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.000]   if you're able to learn how to respond quickly,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.920]   versus like having a big plan
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.160]   that takes a huge amount of time to accomplish.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.320]   - Right, and forcing that through the pipeline,
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.520]   whether or not it fits.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.000]   - Can you just speak to like the place you were,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.960]   the Canadian Arctic?
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.880]   It looked cold.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.520]   - Yeah, we were right near the Arctic Circle.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.760]   I don't know, it was like 60 kilometers
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.520]   south of the Arctic Circle, so it was,
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.800]   it's a really cool area, really remote.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.640]   Thousands of little lakes, you know,
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.760]   when you fly over, you're just like, man, it's incredible.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.200]   There must be so many of those lakes
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.360]   that people haven't been to.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.760]   You know, it really was a neat area, really remote,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.600]   and for the show's purpose, I think it was perfect,
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.320]   'cause it did have enough game
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.960]   and enough different avenues forward
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.280]   that I think it really did reward activity, so I think,
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.360]   but it's a special place.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.320]   It was Dene, there was a tribe that lived there,
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.720]   the Dene people, which interestingly enough,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.840]   here's a side note, when I was in Siberia,
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.920]   I floated down this river called the Podgomennaya Tunguska,
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.440]   and you get to this village called Sulamay,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.560]   and there's these Ket people, they're called,
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.760]   and there's only 600 of 'em left,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.000]   but this is in the middle of Siberia,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.320]   not in like the Pacific Coast,
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.640]   but their language is related to the Dene people,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.800]   and so somehow, you know, that connection
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.440]   was there thousands of years ago, super interesting, but.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.880]   - Yeah, so language travels somehow.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.360]   - Right, and the remnant stayed back there.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.920]   It's very interesting to think through history.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.320]   - Yeah, within languages contains a history of peoples,
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.160]   and it's interesting how that evolves over time,
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   and how wars tell the story,
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.480]   like language tells the story of conflict,
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.240]   and conflict shapes language,
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.480]   and we get the result of that.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.220]   - Right, so fascinating.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.600]   - And the barriers that language creates
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.560]   is also the thing that leads to wars
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.860]   and misunderstandings and all this kind of stuff.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.800]   It's a fascinating tension, but it got cold there, right?
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.200]   It got real cold.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.080]   - Yeah, I mean, I think, I don't know,
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.160]   I didn't have a thermometer,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.200]   but I imagine it probably got to negative 30 at the most.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.960]   You know, it might've gotten,
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.120]   it would've definitely gotten colder had we stayed longer,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.440]   but yeah, to be honest, I was,
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.320]   just that I never felt cold out there.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.100]   I was pretty, I had that one pretty dialed in,
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.960]   and then once you have calories, you can stay warm,
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.440]   you can stay active, you can, you know,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.680]   you gotta dress warm, you know, you don't,
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.960]   never let, oh, there's a good one.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.720]   If you're in the cold, never let yourself get too cold,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.520]   'cause what happens is you'll stop feeling what's cold,
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.880]   and then frostbite, and then issues,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.420]   and then it's really hard to warm back up.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.160]   So every, it was so annoying.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.800]   I'd be out going to ice fish or something,
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.000]   and then I would just notice that my feet are cold,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.040]   and you're just like, ah, dang it.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.680]   I just turn around, go back, start a fire,
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.040]   dry my boots out, make sure my feet are warm,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.920]   and then go again.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.640]   I wouldn't ignore that, you know?
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.480]   - Oh, so you wanna be able to feel the cold.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.960]   - Yeah, you wanna make sure you're still feeling things
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   and that you're not toughening through it,
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.360]   'cause you can't really tough through the cold.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.800]   It'll just get ya, so.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.640]   - What's your relationship with the cold,
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.660]   psychologically, physically?
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.640]   - Ah, it's interesting.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.480]   Well, I actually, there's some part of it
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.960]   that really makes you feel alive.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.400]   You know, I imagine, you know, sometimes in Austin here,
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.800]   you go out, and it's hot, and sweaty,
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   and you're like, ugh.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.920]   You get that kind of, kind of saps you.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.800]   There's something about that brisk cold
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.640]   that hits your face that you're like, boo,
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.800]   wakes you up, makes you feel really alive, engaged.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.120]   You know, it feels like the margins of air are smaller,
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.240]   so you're alert and engaged a little more.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.160]   There is something that's a little bit life-giving,
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.960]   just because you feel on an edge, you're on this edge.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.420]   But you have to be alert, because even, you know,
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.600]   some of the natives I lived with,
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.240]   the lady had face issues,
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.700]   because she let her head get cold
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.880]   when they were on a snowmobile.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.040]   Hat was up too high, you know, that little mistake,
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.120]   and then it just freezes this part of your forehead,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.320]   and then the nerves go, and then you got issues
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.160]   when just the hat wasn't high enough.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.440]   So you kind of got to be dialed in on stuff.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.120]   - Well, there's a psychological element to just,
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.320]   I mean, it's unpleasant.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.120]   If I were to think of what kind of unpleasant
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.120]   would I choose, you know, fasting for long periods of time,
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.600]   because going without food in a warm environment
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.320]   is way more pleasant than--
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.640]   - Being fed in a golden bowl.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.720]   - Exactly, like if you were to choose--
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.240]   - I would choose the opposite.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.920]   - Oh yeah, okay, well, there you go.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.520]   I wonder if that's, I wonder if you're born with that,
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.880]   or if that's developed, maybe your time in Siberia,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.840]   like you, or do you gravitate towards,
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.720]   I wonder what that is, 'cause I really don't like
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.640]   survival in the cold.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.360]   - I think a little bit of it is learned.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.080]   You like almost learn not, you learn not to fear it,
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.560]   you learn to kind of appreciate it,
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.120]   and a big part of that is, I mean, to be honest,
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.760]   it's like dressing warm, being in good,
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.120]   it's not that, you know, there's no secrets to that,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.520]   is you just can't beat the cold,
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.520]   so you just need to dress warm.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.520]   The native, you know, all that fur, all that stuff,
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.760]   and then all of a sudden, you have your little refuge,
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.040]   have a nice, warm fire going in your teepee,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.240]   you know, and then, I bet you could learn to appreciate it.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.560]   - Yeah, I think some of it is just opening yourself up
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.560]   to the possibility that there's something enjoyable
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.520]   about it, like here, I run in Austin all the time
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.200]   in like 100 degree heat, and I go out there
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.040]   with a smile on my face, and like, and learn to enjoy it.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.880]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.320]   - And so you're just like, I look kind of like you do
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.120]   in the cold, and just, I don't think I enjoy the heat,
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.440]   but you just allow yourself to enjoy it.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do feel that way.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.560]   I mean, I don't mind the heat that much,
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.840]   but I think you could get to the place
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.600]   where you appreciated the cold.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.820]   It's probably just a lack of, it's kind of scary
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.440]   when you haven't done it, and you don't know
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.480]   what you're doing, and you go out, and you feel cold.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.720]   It's like, not fun, but I bet you could,
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.040]   you'd enjoy it, you'll have to come out sometime.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.200]   - 100%.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.680]   I mean, you're right, it does make you feel alive.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.520]   That it, like, maybe that's the thing
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.520]   that I struggle with, is the time passes slower,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.600]   'cause it does make you feel alive.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.680]   You get to feel time, but then the flip side of that
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.400]   is you get to feel every moment,
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.440]   and you get to feel alive in every moment.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.760]   So it's both scary when you're inexperienced,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.700]   and beautiful when you are experienced.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.100]   Were there times when you got hungry?
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.740]   - I got shot a rabbit on day one,
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.460]   and I snared a couple rabbits on day two,
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.980]   and then more and more as the time went.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.760]   So I actually did pretty well on the food front.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.300]   The other thing is when you have all those berries around
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.380]   and stuff, you do have an ability to fill your stomach,
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.740]   and so you don't really notice if you're getting thinner,
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.940]   if you're losing weight.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:23.400]   So I can say, on a loan, I was not that hungry.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.120]   I've definitely been really hungry in Russia.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.400]   There were times when I lost a lot of weight.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.480]   I mean, I lost a lot more weight in Siberia
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.560]   than I did on a loan.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.200]   - Oh, wow. - Many times.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.000]   - Okay, we'll have to talk about it.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.120]   So you caught a fish, you caught a couple.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.880]   - I think I caught, like, 13 or so.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.440]   They didn't show a lot of 'em.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.520]   - You caught 13 fish?
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.100]   - 13 of those big fish, too.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.940]   Well, I caught a couple that were small.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.100]   - This is like a meme at this point.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.020]   You're a perfect example of a person who was thriving.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:43:00.020]   - I was thought, you know, in hindsight.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.020]   Again, when I was out there,
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.660]   I never let myself think you might weigh,
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.020]   and I just was gonna be out there as long as I could
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.300]   and tried to remain pessimistic about it.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.780]   No, but then I remember a thought that I was like,
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.340]   I wonder if they're gonna be able to make this look hard.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.940]   I did have that thought at one point,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.820]   and 'cause it went pretty well,
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.100]   and I was definitely, it was hard psychologically
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.980]   because I didn't know when it was gonna end.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.140]   Like, I thought this could go, you know, like I said,
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.100]   six months, it could go eight months, a year,
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.980]   and then you start to, you know,
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.420]   I had a two- and a three-year-old,
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.400]   and you start to weigh in the, is it worth it
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.660]   if it goes a year, and it's not worth it
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.420]   if it goes eight months and I still lose.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.820]   So I feel like I had this pressure,
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.020]   and it was psychologically difficult for that reason.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.860]   Physically, it wasn't too bad.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.860]   - This is off-mic, we're talking about Gordon Ryan
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.540]   competing in jiu-jitsu, and maybe that's the challenge
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.900]   he also has to face is to make things look hard.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:03.260]   'Cause he's so dominant in the sport that,
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:08.140]   in terms of the drama and the entertainment of the sport,
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.460]   and in this case of survival, it has to be difficult.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.660]   - You know, and I'll add that for sure, though,
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.020]   that it's the woods, it's nature,
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.360]   you never know how it's gonna go.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.260]   It's like, every time you're out there,
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.420]   it's a different scenario.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.180]   So, yeah, whatever, hallelujah, it went well.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:27.760]   - So you won after 77 days.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.580]   How long do you think you could have lasted?
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.740]   - When I left, I weighed what I do right now.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.660]   So I just weighed my normal weight.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.420]   I had, you know, a couple hundred pounds of moose.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.980]   I had at least, you know, a hundred pounds of fish.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.340]   I had, you know, a pile of rabbits, a wolverine.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.340]   You know, I had all this stuff.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.460]   And I hadn't gotten cold yet.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:54.020]   I just thought, but in my head, I thought,
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.780]   if I get to day 130 or 40,
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.940]   even if someone else has big game,
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.140]   I had a pretty good idea they might quit.
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.620]   Because it would be long, cold, dark days.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.860]   And how miserable is that?
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.100]   Just, it's so boring, it's freezing.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.460]   And so I thought, the only time I thought
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.500]   I could think about winning
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.620]   is when I got to day 130 or 40.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.420]   And I definitely had that with what I had.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.140]   Now, maybe I would've got, you know,
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.460]   I probably would've gotten more.
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.540]   I had caught that big 20-something pound pike
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.460]   on the last day I was there.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.020]   Maybe catch some more of those.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.460]   You know, and I don't know,
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.860]   like I don't know how many calories I had stored,
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.980]   but I had a lot.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.940]   And so how long would that have lasted me
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.860]   assuming I didn't get anything else?
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.060]   It definitely would've,
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.180]   I definitely would've reached my goal
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.980]   of 130 or 40 days.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.660]   And then after that,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.700]   I thought we were just gonna push into the,
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.500]   you know, then it's just to see how much,
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.180]   who has what reserves and we'll go as far as we can.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.340]   And that would get me through January into February.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.180]   And I just thought, man,
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.380]   that's gonna be miserable for people.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.380]   - And you were like, I can last through misery.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.100]   - And I knew I could do it, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.980]   - What aspect of that is miserable?
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.860]   - The hardest thing for me would have been the boredom
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:14.540]   because it's hard to stay busy when it's all dark out,
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.780]   when the ice is, you know, three, four foot thick,
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.660]   you can't fish.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.660]   And I just think it would've just been really boring.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.300]   You would've had to been a real Zen master
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.100]   to push through it.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.140]   But because I had experience to some degree,
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.300]   I knew I could.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.420]   And then I think things that might, you know,
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.140]   you start thinking about family and this and that
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.660]   in those situations.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.300]   And I just knew that those,
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.380]   because I'd gone to all these trips to Russia
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.740]   for a year at a time,
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.340]   the time context was a little broader for me
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.860]   than I think for some people.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   'Cause I knew I could be gone for a year and come back,
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.100]   catch up with my loved ones, you know,
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.220]   bring what I got back,
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.420]   whether that be psychological or whatever it is,
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.700]   and we'd all enrich each other.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.180]   And once it's in hindsight,
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.220]   that year would have been like that talking about it.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.460]   So I had that perspective in it.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.420]   So I knew I wasn't gonna tap for any other reason
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.380]   other than running out of food someday.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.140]   So that was my stressor.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.620]   - So you're able to, given the boredom,
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.700]   given the loneliness,
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.460]   kind of zoom out and accept the passing of time.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.620]   Just let it pass.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.860]   - You know, for me, I'm gonna act fairly.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   I like to be active.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.740]   And so I would try to think of creative ways
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.340]   to keep my brain busy.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.340]   You know, we saw the like dumb rabbit first skit.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.540]   But then I did a whole bunch of like elaborate
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.300]   Normandy re-invasion, you know,
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.620]   invasion reenactments and stuff.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.260]   It was like a, there was a,
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.300]   every day I would think of,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.380]   I gotta think of something to make me laugh, you know,
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.500]   and then do some stupid skit.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.340]   And then that would be,
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.100]   that would fill a couple hours of my time.
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.020]   And then I'd spend an hour or two,
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.260]   a few hours fishing.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.660]   And then you spend a few hours, you know,
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.500]   whatever you're doing.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.340]   - Would you do that without a camera?
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.180]   - Yeah.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.540]   Oh, no, the skits, funny question.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.380]   That's a good question.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.220]   I don't know.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.180]   I actually don't know.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.300]   That, I will say that was one of the advantages
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.140]   of being on the show versus in Siberia.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.900]   So no, 'cause I didn't in Siberia,
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.300]   just do skits by myself.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.300]   But I didn't film it.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.700]   And so it was quite nice to have this camera
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.900]   that made you feel like you weren't quite as alone
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.260]   as if you were just in the woods by yourself.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.620]   And I think for me, I was able to,
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:26.460]   it was a pain.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.900]   It was part of the cause of me missing that moose.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.980]   You know, there's issues with it,
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.620]   but I just chose to look at it as like,
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.300]   this is an awesome opportunity to share with people
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.340]   a part of me that most people don't get to see,
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.740]   you know, 'cause, no, so that was,
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.260]   I just chose to look at it that way.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.060]   And it was an advantage 'cause you could do stuff like that.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.180]   - I think there's actual power to doing this kind
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.580]   of documenting, like talking to a camera
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.260]   or an audio recorder.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.000]   Like that's an actual tool in survival.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.100]   I had a little bit of an experience of being alone
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.020]   in the jungle and just being able to talk
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.180]   to a thing is much less lonely.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.380]   - It is, it really is.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:09.020]   It can be a powerful tool, just sharing your experience.
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.100]   I had the, I definitely had the thought.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.700]   So going back to your earlier comment,
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.520]   but I definitely had the thought.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.660]   If I knew I was the last person on Earth,
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.500]   I wouldn't even bother.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.420]   Like I wouldn't do that.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.860]   Like I would just, I'd just give up, I'm sure.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.700]   Because even if I had a bunch of food and this and that.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:30.420]   But because I knew, you know you're a part, you're sharing,
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.220]   it gives you a lot of strength to go through.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:36.260]   And having that camera just makes it that much more vivid
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.140]   'cause you know you're not just gonna be sharing
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.200]   a vague memory, but an actual experience.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.420]   - I think if you're the last person on Earth,
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.260]   you would actually convince yourself.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.740]   First of all, you don't know for sure.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.580]   There's always going to be--
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.100]   - Hope dies last.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.060]   - Hope really does die last.
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.260]   You really don't know.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.000]   You really hope to find.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.280]   I mean if you're, if like an apocalypse happens,
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.060]   I think your whole life will be going
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.300]   about finding the other person.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.140]   - It would be.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.980]   And there's a chance, I mean, I guess I'm saying
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.420]   if you knew you were for some reason,
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.220]   knew you were the last, I wonder if you would.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.620]   I wonder if, that was a thought I had.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.700]   If I knew I was the last person.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.580]   Like 'cause out here I was having a good time,
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.460]   having fun fishing, plenty of food.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.260]   But like if I knew I was the last person on Earth,
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.640]   I don't know that I would even bother.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.860]   But now if that was for real, would I bother?
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.700]   That's the question.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.800]   - No, no, no, I think if you knew,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.160]   if somebody, some way you knew for sure,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.620]   I think your mind will start doubting it.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.880]   That whoever told you you're the last person,
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.520]   whatever was lying.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.360]   - Right, right.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.080]   The power of hope might be more stronger
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.820]   than I accounted for in that situation.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.380]   - Also, you might, if you are indeed the last person,
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.360]   you might want to be documenting it for once you die,
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.800]   you know, an alien species comes about.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.960]   'Cause whatever happened on Earth
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.000]   is a pretty special thing.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.960]   And if you're the last one,
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.920]   you might be like the last person
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.880]   to tell the story of what happened.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.800]   And so that's gonna be a way to convince yourself
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.400]   that this is important.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.320]   And so the days will go by like this,
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.240]   but it would be lonely.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.600]   Boy, would that be lonely.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.720]   - It would be, wow.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.600]   You're delving into the dredges, the depths of it.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.760]   - Yeah, I mean-- - Of something.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.800]   - There is going to be existential dread.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.380]   But also, I don't know, I think hope will burn bright.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.800]   You'll be looking for other humans.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.640]   - That's one of the reasons I was looking forward
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.480]   to talking to you.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.240]   Things I appreciate about you is you're always,
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.280]   not out of naivety,
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.720]   but you always choose to look at the positive.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.880]   And I think that's a powerful mindset to have.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.700]   I appreciate it.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.720]   - Yeah.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.680]   That'd be a pretty cool survival situation, though,
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.440]   if you're the last person on Earth.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.040]   - If you could share it.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.520]   (laughing)
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.560]   - If you could share it, yeah.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.240]   Like I said, many people consider you
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.640]   the most successful competitor on a loan.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.120]   The other successful one is Roland Welker, Rock House guy.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.400]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.440]   - This is just a fun, ridiculous question,
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.980]   but head-to-head, who do you think survives longer?
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:12.720]   - If you want to get into the competitive side of it,
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.160]   I would just say I'm pretty dang sure
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.820]   I had more pounds of food.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.040]   (laughing)
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.160]   But, and I didn't have the advantage
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.380]   of knowing when it would end,
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:26.000]   which I think would have been a great psychological.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.840]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.660]   - It would have made it really easy.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.540]   Once I got the moose, I could have shot the moose
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.840]   and just not stressed.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.460]   I would have been like a...
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.560]   And so that was a big difference between the seasons
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.080]   that I felt like, I mean,
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.440]   I felt like the psychology of season seven,
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.100]   they kind of messed up by doing a 100-day cap
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.820]   because, for my own experience, that was the hardest part.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.040]   But Roland's a beast.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.240]   So for people who don't know, they put a 100-day cap on it.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.240]   So it's whoever can survive 100 days for that season.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.560]   It's interesting to hear that for you,
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.760]   the uncertainty, not knowing when it ends,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.280]   is the hardest. - That was for sure, yeah.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.400]   - That's true, 'cause you wake up every day.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.140]   - I didn't know how to ration my food.
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.320]   I didn't know if I was gonna lose after six months
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.000]   and then it was all gonna be for naught.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.360]   I didn't know if it, I just, there's so many unknowns.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.740]   You don't know, like I said,
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:19.480]   if I shot a moose and it was 100 days, done.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.360]   If I shot a moose and you don't know,
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.140]   it's like, crap, I could still lose to somebody else.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.840]   But it's gonna be way in the future.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.640]   (laughing)
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.680]   So anyway, that for me was definitely the hard part.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.120]   - And when you found out that you won
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.280]   and your wife was there,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.400]   it was funny because you're really happy.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.480]   There's a great sort of moment of you reuniting,
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.760]   but also there's a state of shock of like,
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.820]   you look like you were ready to go much longer.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.420]   - That was the most genuine shock I could have.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.740]   I hadn't even like entertained the thought yet.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.620]   I didn't even think it was, you'd hear the helicopters
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.020]   and I just assumed there was other people out there.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.620]   I just hadn't, I thought, and for one,
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.820]   the previous person that had gone the longest
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.180]   had gone 89 days, so I just knew
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.520]   whoever else was out here with me,
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.740]   somebody's got that in their crosshairs.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.220]   They're gonna get to 90 and they're not gonna quit at 90.
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.620]   They're gonna go to 100.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.260]   I just figured we can't start thinking about the end
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.940]   until a couple months from when it ended.
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.700]   So I was just shocked and they tricked me pretty good.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.260]   They know how to make you think you're not,
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.100]   that you're not alone.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.300]   - So they want you to do the surprise.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.900]   - Yeah, they want it to be a surprise.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.340]   - You really weren't, I mean, you have to do that,
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.180]   I guess, for survival.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.500]   Don't be counting the days.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.860]   - No, I think that would be, then you see that
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.340]   and some of the people do that.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.420]   For myself, that would be bad psychology
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.300]   'cause then you're just always disappointing yourself.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.300]   You have to be resettled with the fact
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.980]   that this is gonna go a long time and suck.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.140]   Once you come to peace with that,
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.780]   maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised,
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.380]   but you're not gonna be constantly disappointed.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.220]   - So what was your diet like?
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.380]   Like, what was your eating habits like during that time?
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.700]   Like, how many meals a day?
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.940]   (laughing)
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.940]   - Oh, man, no, I was trying to eat the thing.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.340]   I was like, not trying to,
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.980]   the more the moose is hanging out there,
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.380]   the more the critters, every critter in the forest
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:16.940]   is trying to peck at it or mice trying to eat it and stuff.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.780]   - So one of the ways you can protect the food
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:19.620]   is by eating it.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.580]   (laughing)
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.740]   - So I was having three good meals a day
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.460]   and then I'd cook up some meat and go to sleep
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.780]   and then wake up in the middle of the night
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:28.740]   'cause they're long nights
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:33.180]   and have some meat at night, eat a bunch at night.
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.060]   So I'd usually have a fish stew for lunch
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.420]   and then moose for breakfast and dinner
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:41.780]   and then have some for a nighttime snack
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.820]   'cause the nights were long,
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:44.740]   so you'd be in bed like 14 hours
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.340]   and wake up and eat and dink around and go back to sleep.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.380]   - Is it okay that I was pretty low carb situation?
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:53.940]   - Yeah, I actually felt really good.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.940]   I tried to, I think I would have felt better
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.540]   if I would have had a higher percentage of fat
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.420]   because it's still more protein
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:05.540]   than if you're on a keto diet, you want a lot of fat.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.460]   And so I did try to mix in nature's carbs,
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.740]   different reindeer lichen and things like that,
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:15.740]   but honestly, I felt pretty good on that diet, I will say.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.260]   - What's the secret to protecting food?
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.700]   What are the different ways to protect your diet?
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.740]   - Yeah, a lot of times in a typical situation
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:23.580]   in the woods hunting,
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.980]   you'll raise it up in a tree in a bag,
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:28.420]   put it in a game bag so the birds can't peck at it
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.220]   and hang it in a tree so that it cools.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.900]   You gotta make sure first to cool it 'cause it'll spoil,
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.220]   so you cool it by whatever means necessary,
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.180]   hanging it in a cool place, letting the air blow around it.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:44.680]   And then you'll notice that every forest freeloader
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.100]   in the woods is gonna come and try to steal your food.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:48.940]   - Yeah.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.820]   - And it was just fun.
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.820]   I mean, it was crazy to watch.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.300]   You know, it's all the jay,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.420]   all the camp jays pecking at it.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:00.420]   Everything I did, there was something that could get to it.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.780]   If put on the ground, the mice get on and they poop on it
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.620]   and they kind of mess it up.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:07.780]   So I ultimately, it kind of just dawned on me,
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.780]   shoot, I'm gonna have to build
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.460]   one of those Evenki food caches.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:13.340]   So I did and I put it up there
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.740]   and I thought I kind of solved my problem.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.300]   To be honest, the Evenki then,
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.220]   so they would have taken a page out of like,
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:22.100]   they would have mixed me in Roland's solution.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.700]   They build this tall stilt shelter
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.580]   and then put a box on the top that's enclosed.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.600]   And then the bears can't get to it,
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.660]   the mice can't poop on it, the birds, the wolverine,
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.820]   you know, it's safe.
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.900]   And I never finished it and in hindsight,
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:36.820]   I don't actually know why.
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.940]   I think I was just, the way it timed,
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:40.540]   like I didn't think something was gonna get up there.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.940]   Then it did and then I, you know,
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.180]   you're like counting calories and stuff.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.100]   I should have, in hindsight, just boxed it in right away.
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:49.100]   - To get ready for the long haul.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:50.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.740]   - Is rabbit starvation a real thing?
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:55.100]   - Yeah, so you can't just live off protein
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.700]   and rabbits are almost just protein.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.820]   I'd kill a rabbit, eat the innards
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.620]   and the brain and the eyes
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.300]   and then everything else is just protein.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:08.300]   And so it takes more calories to, you know,
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.140]   process that protein than you're getting from it
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:11.980]   without the fat.
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.540]   So you actually lose, I lost, I had, you know,
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.220]   a lot of rabbits in the first 20 days.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.420]   I had 28 rabbits or something,
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.780]   but I was losing weight at exactly the same speed
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:23.260]   as everybody else that didn't have anything.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.460]   So that's interesting.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.520]   Yeah, and I'd never tried that before.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.920]   So I was wondering if, I'm catching a ton of rabbits,
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.180]   I wonder if I can last, what, six months on rabbits?
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.700]   But no, you just starve as fast as everybody else.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.180]   And so I had to kind of learn that on the fly and adjust.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.940]   - I wonder what to make of that.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.700]   So you need fat to survive, like fundamentally.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.260]   - Yeah, that's the, yeah.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.860]   And you'll notice when the wolverine came
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:48.020]   or when animals came, they would eat the skin off of the fish,
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.060]   they would eat the eyes, you know,
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.380]   they'd steal the moose fat, they'd leave all the meat.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.960]   Yeah, like behind the eyes is a bunch of fat.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.620]   So yeah, you can kind of observe nature
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.380]   and see what they're eating and know where the gold is.
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.260]   - What do you like eating when you're like,
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.820]   when you can eat whatever you want?
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.700]   What do you feel best eating?
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:07.660]   - What do I feel best?
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.340]   I just try to eat clean, I think.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:13.100]   I'm not like super strict or anything,
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.820]   but I think when I eat less carbs, I feel better.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.700]   Meat and vegetables, I like, we eat a lot of,
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.380]   you know, I eat a lot of meat.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.420]   - So basically everything you ate on a loan,
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.260]   plus some veggies.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.420]   - Plus veggies, I'll throw in some buckwheat,
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.180]   like buckwheat, like french bread.
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.360]   - Let's step to the early days of Jordan.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:39.100]   So your Instagram handle is @hobojordo.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.060]   So early on in your life,
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:45.780]   you hoboed around the US on freight trains.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.720]   What's the story behind that?
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.100]   - My brother, when he was 17 or so,
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.700]   he just decided to go hitchhiking
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:54.780]   and he hitchhiked down to Reno from Idaho,
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:58.740]   where we were, and ended up loving traveling,
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.900]   but hated being dependent on other people.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:05.860]   So he ended up jumping on a freight train and just did it.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.740]   He honestly, he pretty much got on a train
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:12.540]   and traveled the country for the next eight years on trains,
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.180]   lived in the streets and everywhere.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.960]   But, you know, he was sober,
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.940]   so it gives you a different experience than a lot.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:21.900]   But at one point when I was, I guess, yeah, 18,
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.860]   he invited me to come along with him.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.540]   He'd probably been doing it five or so,
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.500]   four or five years or more.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.340]   And I said, "Sure."
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.340]   So I quit my job and went out with him.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.100]   Hobo Jorda is a bit of an overstatement.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.260]   I feel self-conscious about that
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.920]   'cause I rode trains across the country,
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.340]   up and down the coast, back.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.740]   You know, spent the better part of the year
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.180]   running around, riding trains,
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.860]   and all the staying in places related to that.
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:50.660]   But all the people, you know, the real hobos,
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.220]   those guys that are out there doing it for years on end.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.580]   But it was such a, for me what it felt like was,
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.060]   it felt like a bit of a rite of passage experience,
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.140]   which is kind of missing, I think, in modern life.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.060]   So I did this thing that was a huge unknown.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.340]   Ben kind of was there with me and my brother for most of it.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.420]   We traveled around, pushed my boundaries in every which way,
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.260]   you know, froze at night and did all the stuff.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.220]   And then at the end, I actually wanted to go back
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.140]   and go back home, and so I went on my own
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:26.520]   and went from Minneapolis back up to Spokane on my own,
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.540]   which was my first stint of time by myself
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.460]   for like a week, which was interesting.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.700]   - Alone with your own thoughts.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.940]   - With your own thoughts is my first time in my life
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.260]   having been like that, you know?
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.220]   And so it was powerful at the time.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.300]   You know what it did, too,
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.500]   is it gave me a whole different view of life
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.260]   'cause I had gotten a job when I was 13,
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.540]   and then 14, 15, 16, 17.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.240]   And then I was just in the normal run of things, kind of.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.780]   And then that just threw a whole different path
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.700]   into my life, and then I realized some of the things
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.460]   while I was traveling that I wouldn't experience again
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.300]   until I was living with natives and such.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.420]   And that was, you know, you wake up,
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.260]   you don't have a schedule.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.020]   You literally just have needs,
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.860]   and you just somehow have to meet your needs.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.860]   And so there's a really sense of freedom you get
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.740]   that is hard to replicate elsewhere.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.660]   And so that was eye-opening to me,
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:20.180]   and I think once I did that, I went back.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.180]   So I went back to my old job at the salad dressing plant,
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.380]   and there was this old cross-eyed guy,
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.580]   and he was, "Oh, Hobo Gordo's back!"
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.220]   And that's kind of where I got it.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.640]   But freedom always was very important to me,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.180]   I think, from that time on.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.940]   - What'd you learn about the United States,
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.260]   about the people along the way?
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.820]   'Cause I took a road trip across the U.S. also,
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.860]   and there's a romantic element there, too,
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:52.860]   of the freedom, of the, well, maybe for me,
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:58.140]   not knowing what the hell I'm gonna do with my life,
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.420]   but also excited by all the possibilities,
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.780]   and then you meet a lot of different people,
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.300]   and a lot of different kinds of stories.
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:11.300]   And also a lot of people that support you for traveling.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.060]   'Cause there's a lot of people kind of dream
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.100]   of experiencing that freedom,
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.820]   at least the people I've met.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:22.180]   And they usually don't go outside of their little town.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.180]   They have a thing, and they have a family, usually,
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.900]   and they don't explore, they don't take the leap.
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.180]   And you can do that when you're young.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.340]   I guess you could do that at any moment.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:37.340]   Just say, "Fuck it," and leap into the abyss
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.200]   of being on the road.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.760]   But anyway, what'd you learn about this country,
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.820]   about the people in this country?
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.320]   - You're in an interesting context
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.180]   when you're on trains,
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.380]   'cause the trains always end up
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.460]   in the crappiest part of town.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.620]   And you're always outside, interacting.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.100]   A lot of the interesting things.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.660]   Every once in a while, you'll have to hitchhike
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.900]   to get from one place to another.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.300]   One interesting thing is you notice
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:04.460]   you always get picked up by the poor people.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.940]   They're the people that empathize with you,
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.340]   stop, pick you up.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.820]   You go to whatever ghetto you end up in,
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:13.700]   and people are really, "Oh, what are you guys doing?"
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.440]   Real friendly and relatable.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.000]   It broadened my horizons, for sure,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.120]   from being just an Idaho kid,
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.480]   and then meeting all these different people
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.320]   and just seeing the goodness in people and this and that.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.200]   It's also a lot of drugs and a lot of people
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.080]   with mental issues that you're friends with,
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.160]   dealing with, all that kind of stuff.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.240]   - Any memorable characters?
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.120]   - Well, there's a few, for sure.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.180]   A lot of 'em I still know that are still around,
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.040]   but Rocco was one guy we traveled with.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.080]   He's become like a brother,
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.080]   but he traveled with my brother for years
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.760]   'cause they were the two sober guys.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.620]   Rather than traveling 'cause he was hooked on stuff,
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.940]   did it to escape all that,
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.480]   and so he was kind of sober and straight edge,
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.400]   and he was a 5'7" Italian guy
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   that was always getting in fights,
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.840]   and he has his own sense of ethics
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.240]   that I think is really interesting
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.640]   'cause he's super honest, but he expects it of others.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.080]   And so it's funny, in the modern context,
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.160]   the thing that pops in my head
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.640]   is when he got a car for the first time,
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.360]   which wasn't that long, he was in his 30s or something,
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.920]   and he registered it,
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.580]   which he was mad about that he had to register,
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.180]   but then the next year,
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.740]   they told him he had to register again,
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.520]   and he's like, "What, did you lose my registration?"
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.560]   He went down there to the DMV,
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.520]   chewed 'em out that he had to re-register
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.080]   'cause he already registered, where's the paperwork?
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.720]   But he just kind of views the world
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.760]   from a different lens, I thought.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.840]   But on everything, he's the character.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.000]   Now he just lives by digging up bottles
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.720]   and finding treasures in them.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.800]   - But he notices the injustices--
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.440]   - He notices them and speaks up,
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.280]   and he's always like,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.120]   "Why doesn't everybody else speak up
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.160]   "about their car registration?"
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.200]   (laughing)
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.360]   And then there was like, Devo comes to mind
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.720]   'cause he was such a unique character
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.000]   as far as just, for one, he would've lived to be 120
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.140]   'cause the amount of chemicals and everything else
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.020]   you put into his body and still,
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.200]   "Hey, man," you know, you're one of those guys.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.440]   You could always get a dime,
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.160]   you know, always spare a dime, spare a dime,
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.560]   and you have bum change,
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.240]   and I'd see him sometimes, and I'd be gone,
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.200]   and then go to New York to visit my sister or something,
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.280]   and I'd go, "Sure enough, there's Devo on the street.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.120]   "What do you know?"
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.320]   And then you go visit him in the hospital
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.600]   'cause he got bit by, you know, 27 hobo spider bites.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.920]   He was just always rough but charismatic,
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.240]   vital, like the vitality of life was in him,
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.280]   but it was just so permeated with drugs and alcohol, too.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.120]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.240]   - I wonder what, 'cause I've met people like that,
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.720]   and they're like, they're just, yeah,
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.880]   joy permeates their whole way of being,
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.560]   and they're like, they've been through some shit.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.440]   They have scars, they've gotten rough,
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.520]   but they've always got a big smile.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.600]   There's a guy I met in the jungle named Pico.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:08.600]   He lost a leg, and he drives a boat,
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.880]   and he just always has a big smile,
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.960]   even given that, like, the hardship he has to get through.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.320]   Everything requires a huge amount of work,
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.360]   but he's just big smile, and there's stories in those eyes.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.080]   - Something about, yeah, enduring difficulty
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.000]   that makes you able to appreciate life
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.680]   and look at it and smile.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.000]   - Any advice for if I were to take a road trip again,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.520]   or if somebody else is thinking of hopping out
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.760]   on a freight train, or hitchhiking?
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.800]   - It's way easier now, 'cause you have a map on your phone.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.640]   You can tell where you're going.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.600]   You're kind of cheating now.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.720]   - It's not about the destination,
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.680]   'cause the map is about the destination.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.960]   - Right.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.480]   - But here, it's like, you don't really give a damn.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.680]   - Yeah, right, the train's where you're going.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.280]   You're not going anywhere.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.120]   - Exactly.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.800]   - I say do it, like, go out and do things,
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.960]   especially when you're young.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.800]   Experiences and stuff help create the person
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.280]   you will be in the future.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.480]   Doing things that you think, like,
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.360]   oh, I don't want to do that.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.600]   I'm a little scared of that.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.160]   I mean, that's what you gotta do.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.840]   You just get out of your comfort zone,
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.680]   and you will grow as a person,
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   and you'll go through a lot of wild experiences
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.520]   along the way.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.160]   Say yes to life in that way.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.440]   - Say yes to life, yeah.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.800]   I love the boredom of it.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.060]   - Freight train riding is very boring.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.000]   (laughing)
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.480]   And you'll wait for hours for a train that never comes,
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.440]   and then you'll go to the store and come back,
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.280]   and it'll be gone.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.840]   And you're like, no!
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.360]   But I remember, we went to jail, we got out, and then--
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.880]   (laughing)
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880]   - How'd you end up in jail?
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.520]   - Oh, you know, it was--
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.360]   - Thanks.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.440]   - Trespassing on a train.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.600]   But we were riding a train, and my brother woke up,
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.560]   and he had a dead owl land on his head.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.480]   And he hit the train and fell on him.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.440]   And we woke up, and we were laughing.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.240]   That's gotta be some kind of bad omen.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.840]   (laughing)
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.560]   And then we were looking out of the train,
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.000]   and we saw a train worker look and saw us.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.840]   And he went, "Oh, we know that's a bad omen."
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   (laughing)
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.440]   Anyway, sure enough, the police stopped the train.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.720]   Somebody had seen us on it.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.440]   And they searched it, got us, and threw us in jail.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.640]   It was not a big deal, we were in jail a couple days.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.440]   And then, but when we got out, of course they put us,
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.400]   we were in some podunk town in Indiana,
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.880]   and we didn't know where to catch out of there.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.520]   And so we were at some factory, and we just,
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.240]   ban in factory, and we were right there for like four days.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.440]   No train that was going slow enough that we could catch.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.080]   And then we found this big old roll of aluminum foil.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.080]   And I gotta apologize to this woman,
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.600]   'cause we were so bored just sitting there.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.320]   We built these like hats, you know,
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.360]   with like horns coming out every which way,
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.000]   and loops, and just sitting there.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.080]   And then it was at night, and some minivan
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.040]   pulled up to this train that was going by, too.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:37.880]   (laughing)
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.760]   We're like, rrr, rrr, rrr, and went over,
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.360]   like circled the car. - Entertaining yourself.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.720]   - Entertaining yourself with whatever you can.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.880]   Poor lady was terrified.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.560]   - So hitchhiking was tough.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.680]   - I didn't like hitchhiking, just 'cause you're
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.240]   depending on other people.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.120]   And it is not, I don't know why.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.800]   You just wanna be independent.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.520]   But if you do meet really cool people,
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.760]   a lot of times, there's really nice people
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.040]   that pick you up, and that's cool.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.680]   But I just personally actually didn't do it a lot.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:09.200]   And I wasn't, you know, if you're on the streets
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.800]   for 10 years, you'll end up doing it a lot more,
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.240]   'cause you need to get from point A to point B.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.360]   But we just tried to avoid it as much as we could,
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.560]   'cause it didn't appeal to us as much.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.080]   - Well, one downside of hitchhiking is people talk a lot.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:21.920]   - Oh, they do.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.080]   - So it's both the pro and the con.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.120]   - 'Cause they'll, you know, sometimes you just wanna be
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.880]   sort of alone with your thoughts.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.880]   There is a kind of lack of freedom in having to listen
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.880]   to a person that's giving you a ride.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.700]   (laughing)
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.540]   - It's so true.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:38.560]   And then you don't know how to react to it.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.480]   I mean, I was young, I remember I got picked up,
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.840]   I was probably 19 or something.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.080]   And then I was just like, "Hey, how's it going?"
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.280]   And she's like, "Oh, fine, my husband just died."
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.480]   And then all, and I got diagnosed with cancer,
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.440]   and this and that, and pretty bitter, and all that,
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.480]   and understandably so, but you're just like,
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.520]   "I have no idea how to respond here."
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.080]   And so then you're young, and you had to be nice,
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.480]   and I remember that ride being interesting,
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.400]   'cause I didn't really know how to respond.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   And she was angry, and going through some stuff,
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.080]   and dumping it out.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.720]   She didn't have anyone else to dump it out on.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.560]   I was like, "Wow."
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.240]   - I'm gonna take the freight train next time.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.300]   So how'd you end up in Siberia?
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.940]   - I'll try to keep it a little bit short on the how.
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.240]   (laughing)
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.600]   But the long story short was I had a brother
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.620]   that's adopted, and when he grew up,
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.960]   he wanted to find his biological mom
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.160]   and just tell her thanks.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:35.160]   And so he did, and when he was probably 20 or something,
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.400]   he found his biological mom, told her thanks.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.960]   Turns out he had a brother that was gonna go over to Russia
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.200]   and help build this orphanage,
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.460]   and that brother was about my age.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:49.040]   I mean, I remember at that time I read this verse that said,
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.760]   "If you're in the darkness and see no light,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.840]   "just continue following me," basically.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.080]   I was like, "Okay, I'm gonna take that to the bank,
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.920]   "even though I don't know if it's true or not."
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.840]   And then the only glimpse of light I got in all that
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.200]   was when I heard about that orphanage,
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.240]   to go build that orphanage.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.320]   And I prayed about it, and I felt,
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.980]   and I can't explain, it brought me to tears.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.700]   I felt so strongly that I should go.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.040]   And so I was like, "Well, that's a clear call.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.440]   "I'm just gonna do it."
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.240]   Yes, I just bought a ticket, got a visa for a year,
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.440]   and then I went and helped build an orphanage.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.600]   And we got that built, but he was an American,
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600]   and I wanted to live with the Russians to learn a language.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.380]   And so he sent me to a neighboring village
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.200]   to live with a couple Russian families that needed a hand,
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.400]   somebody to watch their kids and cut their hay
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.640]   and milk the cow and all that.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.700]   So I found myself in that little Russian village
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:49.200]   just getting to know these two guys and their families.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.200]   It was pretty fascinating.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.240]   And of course, I didn't know the language yet,
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.120]   and they were two awesome dudes.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.720]   Both of them had been in prison
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.360]   and met each other in prison, and were really close,
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.400]   'cause they had found God in prison together
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   and got out and stayed connected.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.680]   And so I'd bounce backs between those two families,
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.320]   and they used to always tell me about their third buddy
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.340]   they'd been in prison with, who was a native fur trapper
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.260]   now in the North.
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.640]   And so they'd go, "You gotta go meet our buddy up North."
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   And one day that guy came through to sell furs in the city,
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.140]   and he invited me to come live with him.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.660]   And my visa was about to expire,
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:29.980]   but I was like, "When I come back, I'll come."
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:34.040]   And so I went back home, earned some more money,
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.660]   did some construction or whatever, then went back
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:41.660]   and headed North to hang out with Yura and Fur Trap.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.100]   And that started a whole new,
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:49.100]   opened a whole new world that I didn't know about.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.820]   - Before we talk about Yura and Fur Trapping,
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:55.040]   let's actually rewind, and would you describe that moment
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.120]   when you were in the darkness as a crisis of faith?
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.620]   - Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:05.620]   It was like, it was darkness in that I didn't know
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:10.740]   how to parse, what is this thing that's my faith?
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:14.820]   And what's the wheat and what's the chaff,
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.100]   and how do I get through it?
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:21.100]   And I basically just clung to keeping it really simple.
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:27.300]   And oddly enough, in my Christian path,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.820]   God was actually defined in a certain, God is love.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.380]   And I was just like, that's the only thing
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.780]   I'm gonna cling to, you know?
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.980]   And I'm gonna try to express that in my life
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:41.980]   in whichever way I can, and just trust that if I do that,
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:45.300]   if I act like I, you know, I've heard this lately,
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.560]   but if you just act like you believe,
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.740]   over time that world kind of opens to you.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:53.740]   When I said I would go to Russia, I prayed.
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.780]   I was like, Lord, I don't see you, I don't know,
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:00.260]   but I got this, what I felt like was a clear call.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.700]   I have only one request, and that is that you would give me
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:06.980]   the faith to match my action.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.700]   You know, I'm choosing to believe.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:12.300]   Like, I could choose not to, because, you know, whatever.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.740]   But I'm gonna choose to act,
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.980]   and I just ask to have faith someday.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:21.420]   And then, honestly, the whole first year I went through,
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.060]   that was a very crazy time for me,
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.060]   learning the language, being isolated,
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.900]   being misunderstood, blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.220]   But then trying to approach all that
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.700]   with a loving, open heart.
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:34.540]   And then I came back, and I realized
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.260]   that that prayer had kind of been answered.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.580]   That wasn't the end of my journey, but it was,
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:42.140]   I was like, whoa, that was like my deepest request
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.000]   that I could come up with,
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.500]   and somehow that had been answered.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.140]   - So through that year, you were just like,
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.540]   first of all, you couldn't speak the language.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.420]   - Right. - That's really tough.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:51.260]   That's really tough. - It's tough,
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.540]   because it's unlike on "Alone," where,
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.140]   because not only can you not speak, and you feel isolated,
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.860]   but you're also misunderstood all the time,
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.740]   so you seem like an idiot and all that.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:03.340]   And so that was tough.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.340]   I felt very alone at that time,
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.380]   at certain times in that journey.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.620]   - But you were sort of radiating,
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:11.940]   like you said, lead with love.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.580]   So you were radiating this kind of camaraderie.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:17.800]   - Mm-hmm, I was really intentional about trying to,
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.620]   I don't know why I'm here.
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:23.820]   I just know that I, that that's my call,
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.500]   is to love one another.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.940]   And so I would just try to like,
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.820]   and then it meant digging people's wells.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.260]   It might mean just going and visiting
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:33.540]   that old lady babushka up at the house that's lonely.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.620]   And that was really cool.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:37.460]   I got to talk to some fascinating ladies and stuff,
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.460]   and then go to that village, help those families.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:42.260]   I'm gonna be like, cut the hay,
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:44.580]   be the most, the hardest worker I can be,
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.060]   because that's my goal here.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.940]   I didn't have any other agenda or anything,
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.540]   except to try to live a life of love,
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.380]   and I couldn't define it beyond that.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.580]   - What was it like learning the Russian language?
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.820]   - Oh, it was super interesting.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.740]   I think, I had the thought while I was learning it,
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.480]   one, that it was way too hard.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.780]   Like, if I would've just learned Spanish or German,
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.020]   I would be so much farther.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.460]   But here I am, a year in, and I'm like,
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.600]   how do you say I want cheese properly?
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.380]   (laughing)
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.500]   And then, but at the same time,
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.180]   it was really cool to learn a language
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:22.420]   that I thought in a lot of ways was richer than English.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.580]   It's a very rich language.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:27.060]   I remember there was a comedy act in Russian,
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.980]   but he was saying, you know,
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:33.340]   one word you can't have in English is (speaking foreign language)
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:37.300]   meaning like, I didn't drink enough to get drunk.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.260]   You know, that type thing.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.260]   But it's just, you can make up these words
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:44.960]   using different prefixes and suffixes,
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.060]   and blend them in a way that is quite unique and interesting,
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.780]   and honestly, would be really good for poetry,
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.020]   'cause it also doesn't have sentence structure,
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:54.060]   in the same way English does.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.900]   The words can be jumbled in a way.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.980]   - And somehow, in the process of jumbling,
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:02.300]   some humor, some musicality comes out.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.140]   It's interesting.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.900]   Like, you can be witty in Russian
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.420]   much easier than you can in English.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:10.340]   Like, witty and funny, and also with poetry,
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:14.180]   you can say profound things by messing with words,
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.540]   and the order of words, which is hilarious,
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.860]   because you had a great conversation with Joe Rogan,
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.540]   and on that program, you talked about
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:27.740]   how to say I love you in Russian, which is hilarious.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:32.220]   And it was, for me, the first time, I don't know why,
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.780]   you were a great person to articulate
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.260]   the flexibility and the power of the Russian language.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.340]   That's really interesting. - Oh, interesting.
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:44.340]   - 'Cause you were saying, like, (speaking foreign language)
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:49.820]   You could say every single order,
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:53.660]   every single combination of ordering of those words
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:59.460]   has the same meaning, but slightly different.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.860]   - You could, like, and it would change the meaning
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.260]   if you took ya out and just said (speaking foreign language)
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.260]   There's, like, a different emphasis, or maybe,
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.860]   or (speaking foreign language)
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:09.380]   or something, you know, like, all these different--
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.100]   - Or just (speaking foreign language)
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.660]   - Right, exactly.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.780]   So it is rich, and it was interesting
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.660]   coming from an English context and getting a glimpse of that
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:19.620]   and then wondering about all those, you know,
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.460]   Russian authors that we all appreciate that,
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.900]   oh, we actually aren't getting the full deal here.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.460]   - Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.700]   I've recently become a fan, actually,
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.220]   of Larisa Volokhonskaya and Richard Prevear.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:36.500]   They're these world-famous translators of Russian literature.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.500]   Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Pushkin,
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.580]   Bulgakov, Pasternak.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:44.540]   They've helped me understand just how much
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.060]   of an art form translation really is.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:50.180]   Some authors do that art more translatable than others,
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.340]   like Dostoevsky is more translatable,
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:54.940]   but then you can still spend a week on one sentence.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.780]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.940]   - Like, just how do I exactly capture
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:00.380]   this very important sentence?
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.380]   But I think what's more powerful
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:07.380]   is not, like, literature, but conversation,
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:12.380]   which is one of the reasons I've been caring
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:16.180]   and feeling the responsibility of having conversations
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:17.500]   with Russian speakers,
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:21.180]   because I can still see the music of it.
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.660]   I can still see the wit of it.
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:24.660]   And in conversation comes out, like,
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.620]   really interesting kinds of wisdom.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:31.180]   When I listen to, like, world leaders
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:36.060]   that speak Russian speak, and I see the translation,
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.500]   and it loses.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:42.500]   It loses the irony, like, in between the words.
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:46.020]   If you translate them literally,
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:50.180]   you lose the reference in there
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.420]   to the history of the peoples.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.420]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.500]   And I've definitely seen that on,
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.460]   like, you know, and if you listen to,
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:00.820]   I think it probably was a Putin speech or something,
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.180]   and you just see that, oh, wow,
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.540]   something major's being lost in translation.
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.860]   You can actually see it happen.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.860]   I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't the case
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.380]   with the, you know, that whole greatest tragedy
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:12.860]   is the fall of the Soviet Union,
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.980]   that I hear him being quoted as saying all the time.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.260]   I bet you there's something in there
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.380]   that's being lost in translation that is interesting.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.540]   - I think the thing I see the most lost in translation
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.420]   is the humor.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:27.300]   - I'll just say that that was the hardest,
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.940]   that was the tangibly the hardest part
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.500]   about learning the language, is that humor comes last.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.940]   And you have to, like, wait.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:35.100]   You have to wait that whole year, you know,
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:36.780]   or however long it takes you to learn a language
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.740]   to be able to start getting the humor.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:39.820]   You know, some of it comes through,
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.460]   but you miss so much nuance.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.900]   And that was really difficult in interaction with people
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.260]   to, like, just be the guy, you know,
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.380]   when there's humor going on
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.860]   and you're totally oblivious to it.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.940]   - Yeah, everybody's laughing and you're like,
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:57.340]   trying to laugh along.
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.700]   What do they make of you?
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.860]   - To be honest?
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:03.660]   - This person that came from no, descended upon us,
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.020]   all full of love.
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.500]   - I've had a nickel for every time I heard, like,
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.740]   oh, Americans suck, but you're a good American.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.580]   You're, like, the only good American I've ever met.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.100]   But then, of course, they never met any.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.540]   - Yeah, exactly, you're the only one.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.100]   - But, you know, I think because I was just,
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.020]   tried to work hard, tried to be more useful
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.900]   than I was a drain, all that, they all,
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:30.340]   I think it was pretty appreciated me out there.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:33.540]   I definitely heard that a lot, and so that's nice.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.540]   - Can you talk about their way of life?
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.340]   So, like, when you're doing fur trapping.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.660]   - Yeah, so fur trapping was an interesting experience.
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:47.300]   Basically, what you do in October or something,
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.940]   you'll go out to your hunting cabin,
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.060]   and you'll have, like, three hunting cabins.
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:54.940]   You'll go stock 'em with noodles or whatever it is,
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.620]   and then for the next couple months or however long,
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.540]   you'll go from one cabin, usually the guys
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.940]   are just out there doing this on their own,
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:04.180]   so they'll go out and they'll go from one cabin,
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.780]   and each cabin will have five or six trap lines
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:08.220]   going out of it every day.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:10.860]   It'll take a half a day to walk into your trap line,
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.780]   open all the traps, and a half a day to get back.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.900]   And they'll do that, so they'll spend a week at a cabin,
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.300]   open up all the traps, and then it'll take a day
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.980]   to hike over to the other cabin, go to that one,
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.900]   open up all those traps, and then there,
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:23.460]   and then, like, three weeks later or so,
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.580]   they'll end up back at the first cabin,
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:26.940]   and then check all the traps.
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.300]   And so it's kind of that rhythm,
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.980]   and they'll do that for, you know,
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.380]   a couple few months during the winter.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:36.300]   And you're trapping sable, they're called sable,
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.300]   like pine martin is what we would have
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.460]   the equivalent of over here, and--
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.300]   - What is it?
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.420]   - It's like a weasel, a furry little weasel,
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.700]   and they make coats out of it.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:49.140]   And so when I went, he showed me how to open a trap,
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:52.500]   showed me the ropes, gave me a topographical map.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.140]   There's one cabin, there's the other,
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.260]   and we parted ways for, like, five weeks.
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:59.380]   We did run into each other once in the middle there
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.300]   at a cabin, but other than that,
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:05.060]   you're just off by yourself, hoping to shoot a grouse
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:07.260]   or something to add to your noodles
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:09.380]   and make your meal better, catch a fish,
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.860]   and then working really hard,
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.340]   trying not to get lost and stuff.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.100]   - How do you get from one trap and location to the next?
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.940]   - That's funny, 'cause it was basically by landmarks
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:23.300]   and feel, like I didn't have a compass and things like that.
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.260]   - By feel, okay.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.180]   - I got myself into trouble once,
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.380]   and the first time I went to one cabin,
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.980]   I got myself into trouble.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:33.660]   First time I went to the other cabin, I nailed it.
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.860]   And so I had two different experiences on my first trip.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.060]   But the one that I nailed, I remember I had to go,
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.620]   and it's like a day hike.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:43.620]   I was like, well, I know the cabin's south,
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.700]   and so if I just walk south,
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.620]   you know, the sun should be on the left in the morning
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.780]   and right in front of me in the middle of the day,
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.420]   and by evening, it should end up at my right,
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:57.340]   and just kind of guess what time it is and follow along.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.100]   And it takes all day, and I kid you not,
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.540]   I ended up like 100 yards from the cabin.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.380]   (laughs)
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:05.940]   I was like, whoa, this is the trail,
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:08.060]   and that's the cabin, like, oh, amazing.
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.900]   And then the other time, I went out,
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:13.300]   and I was heading over the mountains,
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.540]   and I thought, you know, hours had passed.
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.540]   I probably had gotten slightly lost.
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:20.400]   And then I thought I was halfway there,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.860]   so I thought, okay, I'm gonna sit down
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:25.340]   and cook some food, get a drink, I'm thirsty.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:28.100]   So I sat down and went to start a fire,
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.500]   and my matches had gotten all wet,
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.340]   'cause the snow had fallen on me and soaked me,
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:32.780]   and I didn't have 'em wrapped in plastic.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.340]   I was like, oh, no, I can't drink water.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.300]   You know, so I was like, well, I'm just gonna power through.
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:39.980]   I'm halfway there, but I kept hiking,
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.660]   and then I realized it was getting night,
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:45.180]   and then I realized I was at the halfway point,
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:46.900]   'cause I saw this rock that I was like,
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.140]   oh, no, that's the halfway point.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.460]   I was like, I can't do this, and so I need to go get water.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.660]   I ended up having to divert down the mountain
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.660]   and head to the water.
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.820]   I ended up, you know, it was a whole ordeal.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.620]   I had to take my skis off, 'cause I was going through
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:02.460]   an old forest fire burn, so they were all really close trees,
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:04.060]   but then the snow was like this deep,
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.620]   so I was just trudging through,
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:09.980]   and just wishing a bear would eat me and get it over with.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.380]   But I finally made it down to the water,
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.980]   chopped a hole through the ice, was able to take a sip.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:16.580]   - So you're severely dehydrated.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:18.340]   - Severely dehydrated, and I--
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.540]   - Exhausted, cold. - Exhausted, cold.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:23.180]   Like, you know, you feel sort of nervous.
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.740]   You're in over your head, and then I got down to the river,
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.980]   chopped a hole in the ice, drank it, hiked up the river,
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:29.420]   and eventually got to the other cabin.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.380]   It was probably three in the morning or something.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.980]   - He chopped a hole in the ice to drink.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.060]   - To get some water, yeah.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:40.660]   - It's gotta be, like, one of the worst days of your life.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.780]   - You know, it was a bad day for sure.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.900]   I'm out of fumes. (laughs)
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.540]   It was a bad day, and here's what was funny,
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:49.500]   is I got to the cabin at, like, three in the morning,
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:53.660]   and I brushed over a lot of the misery that I had felt,
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.500]   and I laid down, I was about to go to sleep,
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.320]   and then Europe charges in from the other way.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.360]   I was like, "Whoa, dude, Europe, what are you doing?"
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.620]   And I was like, "How's it going?"
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:04.540]   He's like, "Oh, it sucks."
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.780]   And he laid down and just fell asleep.
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:08.020]   I fell asleep, and I was like, "Oh, that's funny.
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.460]   "The last few weeks that we've been apart,
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:11.560]   "who knows what he went through?
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.480]   "Who knows why he was there at that time at night?"
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.420]   All just summarized, and it sucked,
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.220]   and we went to sleep, and the next morning,
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.380]   we parted ways, and who knows what happened.
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:21.220]   - And you didn't really tell him.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.380]   - I never knew neither of us said what happened.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.580]   It's just like, "Oh, that's interesting."
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:29.340]   - Yeah, and he probably was through similar kinds of things.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:30.180]   - Who knows, yeah.
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.740]   - Like, what gave you strength in those hours
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:38.740]   when you're, you know, just going through waist-high snow,
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.180]   all of that?
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:44.980]   You're laughing, but, like, that's hard.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:48.140]   - Yeah, you know that Russian phrase,
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.180]   (speaking in Russian)
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.820]   eyes are afraid, hands do.
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.620]   I'm sure there's a poetic way to translate that.
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:55.900]   - Right, it's kind of like, you know,
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:57.420]   just put one foot in front of the other.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:58.980]   You know, when you think about what you have to do,
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.820]   it's really intimidating, but you just know,
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.580]   if I just do it, if I just do it,
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:06.460]   if I just keep trudging, eventually I'll get there,
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:07.900]   and pretty soon, you realize,
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:10.820]   oh, I've covered a couple kilometers, right?
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.820]   And so when you're really in it in those moments,
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.940]   I guess you're just putting your head down
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.180]   and getting through.
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:19.020]   - I've had similar moments, there's wisdom to that.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.460]   Like, once, just take it one step at a time.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:22.900]   - One step at a time, I think that a lot.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.100]   Honestly, I tell myself that a lot
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.460]   when I'm about to do something really hard,
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.900]   just, you know, (speaking in Russian)
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:28.820]   one step at a time.
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:31.940]   Just gonna get, don't, like, sit there and think,
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.100]   oh, that's a long ways.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.780]   Just go, and then you'll look back
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.340]   and you've covered a bunch of ground.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:38.780]   - One of the things I've realized
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.860]   that was helpful in the jungle,
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.100]   that was one of the biggest realizations for me,
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.140]   is, like, it really sucks right now,
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:51.100]   but when I look back at the end of the day,
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:56.900]   I won't really remember exactly how much it sucked.
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.980]   I have a vague notion of it sucking,
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.380]   and I'll remember the good things.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:05.060]   So, being dehydrated, I'll remember drinking water,
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:09.020]   and I won't really remember the hours of feeling like shit.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.180]   - That's absolutely true.
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:11.900]   I gotta tell you, it's so funny how, like,
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:14.500]   this awareness of that, having been through it
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.100]   and then being aware of it means,
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.740]   next time you face it, you'll be like, you know what?
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:20.020]   Once this is over, I'm gonna look back on it,
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:21.380]   and it's gonna be like that and nothing,
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:23.860]   and I'll actually laugh about it and think it was,
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.980]   it's a thing I'll remember.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:27.500]   You know, I remember that story of that miserable day
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.380]   going down to the ice, and I can smile about it now,
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.040]   and now that I know that, I can be in a miserable position
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.020]   and realize that that's what the outcome will be
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.460]   once it's over. - It's just gonna be a story.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.420]   - It's just gonna be a story.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.460]   - If you survive, though.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.220]   - If you survive, and that can be.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:44.880]   - So, you mentioned you've learned about hunger
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.100]   during these times.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.260]   When was, like, the hungriest you've gotten?
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:52.460]   - It was the first time, so to continue the story slightly,
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.260]   I went fur trapping with that guy,
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.340]   and then it turned out all his cousins
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:59.500]   were these native nomadic reindeer herders,
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:03.020]   and after I, like, earned his trust and he liked me a lot,
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:06.200]   he took me out to his cousins who were all these,
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.940]   you know, nomads living in teepees.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:08.860]   I was like, this is awesome.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.820]   I didn't even know people still lived like this,
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:12.780]   and they were really open and welcoming
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.260]   'cause their cousin just brought me out there
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:19.580]   and vouched for me, but it was during fencing season,
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.180]   and fencing in Siberia for those reindeers,
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:23.100]   like, an incredible thing.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:26.780]   You take an ax, you go out, and you just build
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:31.220]   these 30-kilometer loop fences with just logs interlocking.
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:33.540]   It's tons of work, and all these guys
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.300]   are more efficient bodies.
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.020]   They're better at it, and I'm just, like,
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:41.400]   working less efficiently and also a lot bigger dude,
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.420]   but we're all just on the same rations, kind of,
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:47.860]   and I got down, that was like 155 pounds,
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.580]   you know, getting down pretty dang skinny
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:53.260]   for my 6'3" frame and just working really hard,
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:54.820]   and it's in the spring in Siberia.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:56.700]   There's no, like, there's not much to forage.
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.580]   You know, in the fall, you can have pine nuts
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:30:59.900]   and this and that, but in the spring,
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:03.140]   you're just stuck with whatever random food you've got,
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:07.020]   and so that's where I lost the most weight
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:10.060]   and felt the most hungry, and I had a lot of other issues.
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.940]   You know, I was new to that type of work,
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:15.320]   and so working as hard as I could,
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.060]   but also making mistakes, chopping myself with the ax,
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:22.220]   and getting injured, all kinds of stuff, you know?
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:25.740]   - So injuries plus very low calorie intake.
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:26.780]   - Low, yep.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:27.700]   - And exhausted.
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.980]   - I remember if you got, you were the poor son of a gun,
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.660]   you get stuck slicing the bread, you know,
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.940]   like you're here cutting the bread,
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.340]   and somebody throws all the spoons
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.540]   and drops the pot of soup there,
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.060]   and it's like before you can even done slicing your slice,
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.180]   all the meat's, like, gone from the bowl.
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:43.980]   Everybody else has grabbed the spoon in midair and poof,
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:47.100]   and you're just like, "Oh, hoping this one little noodle's
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.640]   "gonna give me a lot of nourishment."
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.860]   (laughing)
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:54.260]   - Wow, so everybody gets, I mean, yeah,
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.660]   first come, first serve, I guess.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.300]   - 'Cause it's like all the dudes out there
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.220]   working on the fence.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.540]   - So you mentioned the ax, and you gave me a present.
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:06.540]   This is probably the most badass present I've ever gotten.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:10.140]   So tell me the story of this ax.
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:12.620]   - So the natives, when I got there, I thought,
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:13.740]   you know, I grew up on a farm,
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.100]   I thought I was pretty good with an ax,
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:18.140]   but they do tons of work with those things.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:22.140]   And I really grew to love their type of ax,
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:24.240]   their style of ax, and just an ax in general.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.900]   They'd always say it's the one tool you need
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:29.100]   to survive in the wilderness, and I agree.
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:32.740]   And this one has certain, yeah, design features
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:36.100]   that the natives, that was unique to the Evenki,
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.300]   to the natives I was with.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.940]   One is, with these Russian heads, or the Soviet heads,
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:43.900]   whatever they had, they're a little wider on top here,
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.820]   meaning you can put the handle through from the top,
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:50.000]   like a tomahawk, and that means you're not dealing
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.660]   with a wedge, and if it ever loosens and you're swinging,
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:55.660]   it only gets tighter, it doesn't fly off.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:58.280]   And so that's something that's kinda cool.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:02.620]   Then they have, what they do that's unique is,
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.740]   so you can see, there's the Wolverine ax,
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.140]   so it's got the little Wolverine head
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:11.540]   in honor of that Wolverine I fought on the show.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:15.100]   - So you have actually two axes, this is one of the small.
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:16.700]   - This is a little smaller, I didn't wanna make it
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.380]   too small, 'cause you need something
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:20.300]   to actually work out there, you need something
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:21.120]   kinda serious.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.980]   But then they sharpen it from one side,
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:26.000]   so if you're right-handed, you sharpen it
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.940]   from the right side, and that means when you're
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:30.000]   in the woods and living, there's a lot of times
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.700]   where you're, whether you're making a table,
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:34.180]   or a sleigh, or an ax handle, or whatever you're doing,
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.700]   that you're holding the wood and doing this work.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:39.300]   And it makes it really good for that planing.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.700]   The other thing it is, especially in northern woods,
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.820]   all the trees are like this big, you know,
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:46.220]   you're never cutting down a big, giant tree.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:50.060]   And so when you swing with a single-sided ax like this,
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:52.180]   sharpened from the one side, it really,
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.820]   with your right-hand swing like this,
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:56.780]   it really bites into the wood, and gives you a,
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:59.280]   because with that, if you can picture it,
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.140]   that angle's gonna cause deflection.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:04.140]   And without that angle on your right-handed swing,
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:06.340]   it just, like, bites in there like crazy.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:11.020]   And so, that, there's other little,
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:14.380]   you know, the handle was made by some Amish guys in Canada.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.780]   This is all hand-forged by--
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:17.620]   - Oh, it's hand-forged?
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.440]   - Yeah.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.280]   - I mean, yeah, it looks--
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.940]   - And so it's a pretty sweet little--
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.180]   - Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:23.180]   - There's other things, you know,
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:25.540]   like I slightly rounded this pole here.
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:28.600]   It's just a little nuance, 'cause when you pound a stake in,
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.340]   if you picture it, if it's convex, when you're pounding it,
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:34.860]   it's gonna blow the fibers apart.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.860]   If it has just a slight concave,
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.200]   it helps hold the fibers together.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.880]   And so, it's a little nuance, not too flat,
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.420]   'cause you wanna still be able to use the back as you would.
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.380]   - What kind of stuff are you using the axe for?
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:49.500]   - Oh, so the axe is super important to chop through ice
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.300]   in a winter situation, which you probably,
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.380]   hopefully, won't need. (laughs)
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:57.860]   But what I use an axe all the time for is when I'm,
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:01.340]   when it's wet and rainy, and you need to start a fire,
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.740]   like, it's hard to get to the middle of dry wood
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.940]   if it's just a knife or a saw.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:10.620]   And so, I can go out there, find a dead, tall tree,
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:12.820]   you know, a dead standing tree, chop it down,
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:14.500]   split it apart, split it open,
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.560]   get to the dry wood on the inside,
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.620]   shave it, some little curls,
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.540]   and have a fire going pretty fast.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.100]   And so, if I have an axe, I feel always confident
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.860]   that I can get a quick fire in whatever weather,
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:29.580]   and I wouldn't feel the same without it in that regard.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:31.360]   So, that's the main thing.
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.420]   Of course, you can use it, I use it
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:36.140]   if you're taking an animal apart,
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:39.020]   or if you're, you know, all kinds of,
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:44.460]   what else, building a shelter, skinning teepee poles,
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:45.500]   or whatever you're doing.
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.300]   - What's the use of a saw versus an axe?
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.760]   - I greatly prefer an axe.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.600]   A saw, though, has, its value goes up quite a bit
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.020]   when you're in hardwoods.
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.900]   Like, when you're in a hardwood oaks and hickory
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.860]   and things like that, they're a lot harder to chop.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:04.380]   So, a saw is pretty nice in those situations, I'd say.
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:07.880]   In those situations, I'd like to have both.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:11.220]   In the north woods, and in more coniferous forests,
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:13.060]   I don't think there's enough advantages
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.100]   that a saw incurs.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:15.700]   With a good axe, now, you'll see people
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.380]   with little camp axes and stuff,
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.460]   and they just don't think they like axes.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.460]   It's like, well, you haven't actually tried a good one first.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:24.300]   And get good with it.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.820]   The one thing about an axe, they're dangerous,
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:28.900]   so you need to practice, always control it with two hands,
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.980]   make sure you're not, you know where it's gonna go,
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:33.700]   it doesn't hit you, or when you're chopping,
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.360]   like, say, you're creating something,
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.220]   that you're not doing it on rocks and stuff,
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.220]   so that it's, you're doing it on top of wood,
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:40.540]   so that when you're hitting the ground,
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:41.700]   you're not dulling your axe.
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:43.940]   You know, you gotta be a little bit thoughtful about it.
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:45.060]   - Have you ever injured yourself
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.580]   with an axe in the early days?
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:47.960]   - Oh, yeah. (laughs)
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.780]   That first, so I'd gotten a knee surgery,
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:53.100]   and then about three months later,
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.180]   I had torn my ACL, and I went over to Russia,
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:56.700]   and I was like, well, I got a good knee, it's okay.
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.020]   And then, that's when I was building
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:59.680]   that fence that first time.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.500]   And at one point, I chopped my rubber boot with my axe,
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.500]   'cause it reflected off, and I was new to 'em,
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:10.540]   and I was really frustrated, 'cause I'd done it before.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:14.400]   And the native guy was like, oh, you know,
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.980]   I think there's a boot we left.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.380]   You know, a few years ago, we left a boot
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:19.660]   like four kilometers that way.
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:22.100]   So we got the reindeer, took 'em, rode 'em over.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.820]   Sure enough, there's a stump with a boot upside down.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:25.740]   Pull it off, put it on.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:27.480]   I was like, sweet, I'm back in business.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.820]   Went back, couple days later, bing, choom, chopped it.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:32.900]   Cut your foot, cut my rubber boot,
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.180]   and I was just like, dang it.
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:36.980]   And I was mad enough that I just grabbed the axe
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:39.060]   and swung it at the tree, and it just one-handed,
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.380]   and deflected off, and bam, right into my knee.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.420]   - Oh, no. (laughs)
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:44.980]   - I was like, oh, I fell down.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:46.800]   I was like, oh, my gosh, 'cause you get your axe
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.540]   really razor sharp, and then just swung it into my knee.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:51.460]   I didn't even wanna look.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.500]   I was like, oh, no.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.460]   I looked, and it wasn't a huge wound,
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.780]   because it had hit right on the bone of my knee,
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.540]   but it split the bone, cut a tendon there,
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.660]   and I was out in the middle of the woods.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.940]   So I literally, I knew I was in shock,
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.440]   'cause I'm just gonna go back to teepee right now.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.840]   So I ran back to teepee, laid down,
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.980]   and honestly, I was stuck there for a few days.
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:12.740]   I was in so much pain, and my other knee was bad.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.140]   It was rough.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:17.580]   I literally couldn't even walk at all or move.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:19.940]   I had to, there was a plastic bag.
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:23.260]   I had to poop in it, and roll to the edge of the teepee,
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:27.060]   shove it under the moss, like I was just totally immobilized.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:30.420]   - I guess that should teach you to not act
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.700]   when you're in a state of frustration or anger.
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:33.540]   - There you go.
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.100]   I mean, it's such a lesson, too.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:37.980]   There were so many of those, and it was always,
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:39.580]   I was always in a little bit over my head,
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.260]   but like I said, you kind of do that enough,
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:45.300]   and you make a lot of mistakes, but every time you learn.
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:46.740]   Now it's like an extension of my arm.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:47.580]   That's not gonna happen,
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:50.620]   because I just know how it works now.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.220]   - You mentioned wet wood.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:54.780]   How do you start a fire
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:57.340]   when everything around you is wet?
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:58.720]   - I mean, it depends on your environment,
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:00.220]   but I will say in most of the forests
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:02.860]   that I spend a lot of time in, in all the north woods,
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:07.060]   the best thing you can do is find a dead standing tree.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:11.060]   So it can be downpouring rain, and you chop that tree down,
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:13.540]   and then when you split it open,
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:14.980]   no matter how much it's been raining,
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:16.900]   it'll be dry on the inside.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.980]   So you chop that tree down, chop a piece,
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.220]   you know, a foot long piece out,
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:24.860]   and then split that thing open, and then split it again,
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:27.660]   and then you get to that inner dry wood,
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:30.420]   and then you try to do this maybe under a spruce tree
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.460]   or under your own body,
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:34.020]   so that it's not getting rained on while you're doing it.
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.820]   Make a bunch of little curls that'll catch a flame or light,
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:40.860]   and then you make a lot more kindling
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:42.740]   and little pieces of dry wood than you think,
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:43.820]   'cause what'll happen, you'll light it,
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.140]   and it'll burn through, and then like, dang it.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.540]   So just be patient, you're gonna be fine.
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:52.620]   You know, like, and make a nice pile of curls
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.540]   that you can light or spark,
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:57.540]   and then get a lot of good dry kindling,
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.640]   and then don't be afraid to just boom, boom, boom,
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.020]   pile a bunch of wood on and make a big old fire,
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:03.460]   get warm as fast as you can.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:05.960]   It's amazing how much of a recharge it is
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.460]   when you're cold and wet.
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.700]   - You can throw relatively wet wood on top of that.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:12.900]   - Once you get that going, yeah, then it'll dry as it goes,
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:14.620]   but you need to be able to split open
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:18.020]   and get all that nice dry wood on the inside.
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:21.800]   - I saw that you mentioned that you look for fat wood.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.940]   What's fat wood?
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.700]   - So on a lot of pine trees,
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:27.540]   a place where the tree was injured when it was alive,
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.420]   it like pumps sap to it.
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.340]   And this is a good point, because I use this a lot.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.900]   It pumps that tree full of sap,
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:38.980]   and then years later, the tree dies, dries out, rots away,
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:41.900]   but that sap-infused wood,
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:45.900]   it's like turpentine in there, you know?
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:49.780]   It's oily, and so if it gets wet, you can still light it.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.400]   It repulses water.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:55.220]   And so if you can find that in a rainstorm,
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:57.140]   you can just make a little pile of those shavings,
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:59.180]   get the crappiest spark or quickest light,
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:01.220]   and it'll just sit there and burn
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:04.060]   like a factory fire starter.
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.000]   You know, it's really, really nice.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.580]   So it's good to spot.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:09.420]   It's a good thing to keep your eye out for.
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.820]   - Yeah, it's really fascinating.
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.900]   And then you make this thing.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.900]   That's just to get the sauna going fast.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:17.620]   (laughs)
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:18.460]   - What was that?
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:19.280]   That was oil?
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.380]   - Oh, it was used motor oil.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.500]   I add, if you mix it with some sawdust,
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:26.420]   and then, no, the sauna's going just like that.
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:28.540]   It's kind of like homemade fat wood.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:32.340]   - I don't know how many times I've watched Happy People,
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:35.260]   A Year in the Taiga by Werner Herzog.
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:37.500]   You've talked about this movie.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:40.700]   Where is that located relative to where you were?
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:43.500]   - So there's this big river called the Yenisei
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.940]   that feeds through the middle of Russia.
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:48.340]   And there's a bunch of tributaries off of it.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:50.540]   And one of the tributaries is called the Podkom
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:52.820]   in the Tunguska, and I was up that river.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:55.100]   And just a little ways north is another river
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:57.580]   called the Bakhta, and that's where that village is
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:59.140]   where they filmed Happy People.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.580]   So in Siberian terms, we're neighbors.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.020]   (laughs)
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.260]   - Nice.
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.540]   - Similar environment, similar place.
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:10.940]   The fur trapper that I was with knew the guy in the film.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:13.020]   - What would you say about their way of life?
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:15.180]   Maybe in the way you've experienced it
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:17.860]   and the way you saw in Happy People.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:21.660]   - There's something really, really powerful
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:26.660]   about spending that much time being independent,
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:30.700]   depending on what we talked about a little earlier,
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.300]   but you're putting yourself in these situations
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.660]   all the time where you're uncomfortable, where it's hard,
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:36.180]   but then you're rising to the occasion.
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:37.260]   You're making it happen.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.820]   When you're fur trapping by yourself,
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.380]   there's nobody else to look at to blame
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:43.620]   for anything that goes wrong.
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.980]   It's just yourself that you're reliant on.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:50.860]   And there's something about the natural rhythms
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:55.820]   that you are in when you're that connected
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.380]   to the natural world that really does feel like
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.540]   that's what we're designed for.
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:02.060]   And so there's a psychological benefit you gain
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:05.140]   from spending that much time in that realm.
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:08.420]   And for that reason, I think that people
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:09.740]   that are connected to those ways
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.700]   are able to tap into a particular...
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.540]   I noticed it a lot with the natives.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.460]   So if I met the natives in the village,
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:21.820]   I would think of them as unhappy people.
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:25.900]   They drink a lot, they're always fighting,
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:27.660]   the murder rate is through the roof,
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.220]   the suicide rate's through the roof.
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:32.020]   But if you meet those same people out in the woods
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:35.380]   living that way of life, I thought these are happy people.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:37.780]   And it's an interesting juxtaposition,
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:39.060]   it'd be the same person.
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:42.100]   But then I lived in a native village
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.700]   that had the reindeer herding going on around it
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.660]   and everybody benefited because of that.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:48.020]   I also went to a native village
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:51.020]   that they didn't hold those ways anymore.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:52.980]   And so everybody was just in the village life
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:54.460]   and it just felt like a dark place.
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:56.220]   Whereas the other native village,
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:57.580]   it was rough in the village
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:59.020]   because everybody drank all the time.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.020]   But it had that escape and it had that escape valve.
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:02.860]   And then once you're out there,
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:04.460]   it's just a whole different world.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:08.380]   And it was such an odd juxtaposition.
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:12.780]   - It's funny that the people that go trapping
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:14.580]   experience that happiness.
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:19.220]   And still don't have a self-awareness
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:21.860]   to stop themselves from then drinking
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:24.860]   and doing all the dark stuff when they go to the village.
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:27.340]   It's strange that you're not able to,
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:28.780]   you're in it, you're happy,
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:30.820]   but you're not able to reflect
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:33.420]   on the nature of that happiness.
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:34.420]   - It's really weird.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:35.460]   I've thought about that a lot
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:36.980]   and I don't know the answer.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.340]   It's like there's a huge draw to comfort.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.180]   There's a huge,
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.540]   and it's all multifaceted and somewhat complex
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.340]   because you can be out in the woods
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:45.380]   and have this really cool life.
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:48.260]   I will say it's a little bit different for men than women
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:50.780]   because the men are living the dream
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:53.180]   as far as what I would like.
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:56.460]   So you're hunting and fishing and managing reindeer
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:58.700]   and you got all these adventures.
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.700]   So what ends up happening is that a lot more guys
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.900]   than young men out there in the woods.
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.300]   And so there's a draw also, I think,
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:07.740]   to go to the village probably to find a woman.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:11.180]   And then there's a draw of technology and the new things.
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.100]   And I think it,
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:13.900]   but then once they're there, honestly,
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.580]   alcohol becomes so overwhelming
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:19.540]   that everything else kind of just fiddles away.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:22.660]   - But it's funny that the comfort you find,
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:23.980]   there's a draw to comfort.
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:26.900]   But once you get to the comfort,
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:28.700]   once you find the comfort,
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:29.860]   within that comfort,
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:32.780]   you become the lesser version of yourself.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.780]   - Yeah, oh, for sure.
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:34.620]   - It's weird.
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:37.060]   - What a lesson for us.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:39.060]   - Like we need to keep struggling.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:41.500]   - Yeah, a lot of times you have to force yourself in that.
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.900]   So like if we take them as an example,
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:46.020]   I mean, a lot of times you drag this drunk guy
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:47.380]   into the woods,
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:50.020]   literally just drag him into the woods
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.180]   and then he'd sober up
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:53.660]   and then he was like a month blackout drunk
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:54.500]   and now he's sobered up
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:56.140]   and now boom, back into life,
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:59.940]   back into being a knowledgeable, capable person.
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:02.420]   And because comfort's so available to us all,
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:05.220]   you almost have to force yourself into that situation,
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:06.100]   plan it out.
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:08.380]   Okay, I'm gonna go do that.
[01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:09.220]   - Do the hard thing.
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:10.460]   - I'm gonna do that hard thing
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:13.300]   and then deal with the consequences when I'm there.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:15.260]   - What do you learn from that
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:16.460]   on the nature of happiness?
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:18.180]   What does it take to be happy?
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:19.380]   - Happiness is interesting
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:23.580]   because it's complex and multifaceted.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:26.060]   It includes a lot of things that are out of your control
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:27.900]   and a lot of things that are in your control.
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:32.740]   And it's quite the moving target in life.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:33.580]   You know what I mean?
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:34.420]   - Yeah.
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:37.700]   - One of the things that really impacted me
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:41.100]   when I was a young man and I read the Gulag Archipelago
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:42.820]   was don't pursue happiness
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:44.780]   because the ingredients to happiness
[01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:46.180]   can be taken from you,
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:48.820]   outside of your control, your health.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:52.460]   But pursue a spiritual fullness.
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:57.220]   Pursue, I think he words it, duty.
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:00.340]   And then happiness may come alongside or it may not.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:01.980]   So he gave the example that I thought
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:04.580]   was really interesting in the prison camps.
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.740]   Everybody's trying to survive
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:08.220]   and they've made that their ultimate goal.
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.460]   I will get through this.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:13.060]   And then, and they've all basically turned into animals
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.220]   in pursuit of that goal
[01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:16.580]   and like lying and cheating and stealing.
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.420]   And then he was like,
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.980]   and somehow the corrupt Orthodox church
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.940]   produced these little babushkas
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:25.580]   who were like candles in the middle of all this darkness
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:28.180]   because they did not allow their soul to get corrupted.
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.420]   And he's like, what they did do is they died.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:34.020]   They all died, but they were lights while they were alive
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:36.700]   and lost their lives, but they didn't lose their souls.
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:38.900]   So for myself, that was really powerful to read
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.180]   and realize that the pursuit of happiness
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:43.500]   wasn't exactly what I wanted to aim at.
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.500]   I wanted to aim at living out my life according to love,
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.980]   like we talked about earlier.
[01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:50.300]   - Trying to be that candle.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:51.540]   - Trying to be that candle.
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:52.980]   Yeah, make that your ideal.
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.500]   And then in doing so is interesting.
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:58.980]   So for me personally, my personal experience of that is
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:01.380]   I thought when I went to Russia that I kind of gave up.
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:04.180]   I was like in my 20s, I spent my whole 20s
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.220]   living in teepees and doing all this stuff
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:08.140]   that I thought I should be getting a job.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.540]   I should be pursuing a career.
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.980]   I should get an education of some sort.
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.020]   Like what am I doing for my future?
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:15.900]   But I felt I knew where my purpose was.
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:16.740]   I knew what my calling was.
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:17.740]   I'm just gonna do it.
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:20.340]   And it sounds glamorous now when I talk about it,
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.820]   but it sucked a lot of the times.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:24.540]   And it was a lot of loneliness,
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.060]   a lot of giving up what I wanted,
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:29.500]   a lot of watching people I cared about.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.940]   You put all this effort in and you just see the people
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:33.540]   that you put all this effort in just die,
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.180]   and this and that, and then commits,
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.540]   it was that happened all the time.
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.300]   And then the other thing I thought I gave up
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:40.620]   was a relationship 'cause you couldn't,
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:45.220]   I wasn't gonna find a partner over there.
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:48.500]   And so interestingly enough, now in life,
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:50.260]   I can look back and be like, whoa, weird,
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.740]   those two things I thought I gave up
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.580]   is where I've been almost provided for the most in life.
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:59.500]   Now I have this career guiding people in the wilderness
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.220]   that I love, I genuinely love it.
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:02.300]   I find purpose in it.
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:04.540]   I know it's healthy and good for people.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:07.820]   And then I have an amazing wife and an amazing family.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:09.060]   How did that happen?
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:10.900]   But I didn't exactly aim at it.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:15.900]   I consciously, in a way, I mean, I hoped it was tangential,
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:18.060]   but I aimed at something else,
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.860]   which was those lessons I kind of got
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:21.180]   from the Gulag Archipelago.
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:26.020]   - So you have, just 'cause you mentioned Gulag Archipelago,
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.740]   I gotta go there.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.620]   You have some suffering in your family history,
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:35.700]   whether it's the Armenian-Assyrian genocide
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.260]   or the Nazi occupation of France.
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:42.820]   Maybe you could tell the story of that.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:50.020]   The survival thing, it runs in your blood, it seems.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:51.500]   - I love history.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:54.460]   I find so much richness in knowing what other people
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.220]   went through and find so much perspective
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:57.780]   in my own place in the world.
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:01.260]   I have the advantage of, in my direct family,
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:02.380]   my grandparents, yeah,
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:04.780]   they went through the Armenian genocide.
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:08.260]   They were Assyrians, which was like a Christian minority,
[01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:10.740]   indigenous people in the Middle East.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.620]   They lived in Northwestern Iran.
[01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:16.420]   And during the chaos of World War I,
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:21.020]   and the Ottoman Empire was collapsing
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:22.460]   and it had all kinds of issues.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:25.940]   And one of its issues was it had a big minority group
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:28.100]   and it thought it would be a good time to get rid of it.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:33.100]   And you know, they can justify it in all the ways you can,
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.540]   like there were some people that were rebelling
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:36.380]   or this or that.
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:39.460]   But ultimately, it was just a big collective guilt
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:44.140]   and extermination policy against the Armenians
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:47.380]   and the Assyrians and my grandparents.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:51.540]   My grandma was 13 at the time and my grandpa was 17,
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:53.500]   which is interesting 'cause it happened
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.380]   almost a hundred years ago,
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:56.700]   but our, just my dad was born when my mom was,
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:58.200]   my grandma was pretty old, so.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:04.260]   But my grandmother, her dad was taken out to be shot.
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:06.900]   You know, the Turks were coming in
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:08.940]   and rounding up all the men
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.420]   and they took them out to be shot.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.220]   And then they took my grandma and her,
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:17.140]   she had seven brothers and sisters and her mom
[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:19.340]   and they like drove her out into the desert.
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:24.100]   Basically, she, her dad got taken out to be shot,
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:26.380]   so his name was Shalman Yamar or whatever.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.980]   Took him out.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.820]   They were all tied up, all shot.
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:31.860]   He said a quick prayer before they shot him,
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:36.160]   but he fell down and he found he wasn't hit.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:37.380]   And usually, of course, they'd come up
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:39.660]   and stab everybody or finish him off,
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.820]   but there was some kind of an alarm
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.860]   and all the soldiers rushed off
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.220]   and he found himself in the bodies
[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.580]   and was able to untie himself.
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:49.500]   They were naked and, you know, hungry and all that
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:52.380]   and he ran out of there, escaped,
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:55.140]   went into a building and found a loaf of bread
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:59.620]   wrapped in a shirt and was able to escape, fled.
[01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:02.780]   He never saw his family for, so to continue the story,
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:07.220]   my grandma got taken with her mother
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.580]   and brothers and sisters and all just,
[01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:10.420]   they just drove them into the desert until they died,
[01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:12.540]   basically, and run them around in circles
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:14.700]   and this and that and then all the raping
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:16.300]   and pillaging that accompanies it.
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:21.300]   And at one point, her mom had the baby
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:25.460]   and the baby died and her mom just collapsed
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.980]   and said, "I just can't go any further."
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:30.420]   And my grandma and her sister, like,
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:32.420]   picked her up to, "We gotta keep going,"
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:34.740]   and like, picked her up and they left the baby
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:36.940]   along with the other, everybody else had died.
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:38.660]   It was just the three of them left
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:42.980]   and somehow they bumbled across this British military camp
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:44.200]   and were rescued.
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.360]   Neither the sister nor my great-grandmother
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:49.940]   ever really covered as far, you know,
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.380]   recovered from what I understand,
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:53.360]   but my grandma did.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:58.700]   At the same time, in another village in Iran there,
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:02.940]   the Turks came in and were burning down my grandpa's village
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:06.380]   and they caught, and my grandpa's dad was in a wheelchair
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.300]   and he had, like, some money belt
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.460]   and he stuffed all his money in it
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:12.340]   and gave it to grandpa and just told him to run
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:13.300]   and don't turn back.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.620]   And they came in the front door
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:16.300]   as he was running out the back
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:19.240]   and he never saw his dad again.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:22.840]   But he turned around and saw the house on fire,
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:25.380]   never knew what happened to his sister.
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:27.780]   So he was just alone, he ran.
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:30.780]   Yeah, at some point he, I can't remember,
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:32.540]   he, like, lost his money belt
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.500]   and, like, he took his jacket off, forgot it was in there.
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.520]   Something happened.
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.700]   Anyway, so he got, he was in a refugee camp.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:41.340]   He ended up getting taken in by some Jesuit missionaries.
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:44.820]   So anyway, both of them had lost basically everything.
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:47.840]   And then at some point they met in Baghdad,
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:51.380]   started a family, immigrated to France,
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:54.180]   and then it just so happened to be right before World War II
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:56.700]   and so then the Nazis invaded.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:58.060]   My aunt, she's still alive,
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:02.900]   but she actually met a resistance fighter,
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:04.140]   you know, for the French.
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:06.660]   And under a bridge somewhere.
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:09.620]   And they fell in love and she got married,
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:13.460]   so she had kind of an in on the French resistance
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.300]   at one point.
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:16.100]   And of course, they were all hungry.
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:17.380]   They'd recently immigrated,
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.660]   but also had this Nazi occupation and all that.
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:24.420]   And so the Uncle Joe, the resistance fighter guy,
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:27.560]   told him, like, hey, we're gonna storm this noodle factory.
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:28.400]   Like, come.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:29.940]   And so they stormed the noodle factory
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:31.320]   and all my aunts around in there
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.540]   and were, like, throwing out noodles into wheelbarrows
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:34.840]   and everybody was running.
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:38.440]   Then the Nazis came back and took it back over
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:41.260]   and, like, shot a bunch of people and everything.
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:44.180]   And Grandpa, 'cause he had already come
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.460]   from where he came from, was paranoid,
[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.740]   so he buried all the noodles out in the garden.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:51.880]   And then my two aunts got stuck in that factory overnight
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.540]   with all the Nazi guards or whatever.
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.300]   And then the Nazi guards went all from house to house
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:58.340]   to find everybody that had had noodles
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.320]   and, you know, punish 'em.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.860]   But they didn't find my grandpas, fortunately.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.140]   They searched his house, oh, but not the garden.
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:07.500]   And then, so they had noodles
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.900]   and somehow must have been in the same factory or something,
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:11.780]   but olive oil, and they just lived off of that
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:13.700]   for all the whole war years.
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:15.700]   My aunts ended up getting out of the,
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:18.400]   they hid behind boxes and crates overnight and stuff,
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.660]   and the resistance stormed again in the morning
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:22.500]   and they got away and stuff.
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:23.980]   But anyway, chaos.
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.580]   So when they moved to America, I will say,
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:27.940]   the most patriotic family everywhere ever.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.040]   They loved it.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:29.880]   (laughing)
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:32.140]   It was like paradise here.
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:36.780]   - I mean, that's a lot to go through.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:40.340]   What lessons do you draw from that on perseverance?
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:42.560]   - Look, I'm just one generation away
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:43.940]   from all that suffering.
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:47.060]   Like my aunts and uncles and dad and stuff
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.780]   were the kids of these people.
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.460]   And somehow, I don't have that,
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:53.140]   like what happened to all that trauma?
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:57.280]   Like it's like somehow my grandparents bore it.
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:59.480]   And then they were able to build a family,
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:02.140]   but not just a family, but a happy family.
[01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:03.580]   Like I knew all my aunts and uncles
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:05.140]   and I didn't know them, they died before me,
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:08.920]   but it was so much joy.
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.860]   The family reunions were the best thing ever
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:11.700]   at the Jonas's.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.240]   And it's just like how in one generation
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.940]   did you go from that to that?
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:21.020]   And it must have been a great sacrifice
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:26.020]   of some sort to not pass that much resentment,
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:29.700]   or like what did they do to break that chain
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:30.680]   in one generation?
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.880]   - Do you think it works the other way?
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:36.360]   Like where their ability to escape genocide,
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.360]   to escape Nazi occupation gave them a gratitude for life?
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:43.640]   - Oh yeah.
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.680]   - It's not a trauma in the sense
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:47.520]   like you're forever bearing it.
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:50.200]   The flip side of that is just gratitude
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:53.040]   to be alive when you know so many people did not survive.
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.280]   - Yeah, it must be because the only footage
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:57.480]   I saw of my grandma, it was like they were all,
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:00.440]   the kids and stuff, and they were cooking up a rabbit
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:01.680]   that they were raising or whatever.
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:05.920]   And they, but a joyful woman, you could see it in her.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:10.440]   And she must have been so, she must have understood
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:13.280]   how fortunate she was and been so grateful for it
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:16.600]   and so thankful for every one of those 11 kids she had.
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.920]   So I recognize it again in my dad,
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:21.600]   'cause my dad went through a really slow
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.160]   kind of painful decline in his health.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:28.080]   And he had diabetes, ended up losing one leg.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.400]   And so he lost his job.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:32.800]   He had to watch his mom, or my mom go to school.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:35.560]   He had long, all he wanted to do was be a provider
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:36.880]   and be like a family man.
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:38.240]   I bet the best time in his life
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:40.080]   was when his kids ran to him and gave him a hug.
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.080]   But then all of a sudden he found himself
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:43.320]   in a position where he couldn't work
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.760]   and he had to watch his wife go to school,
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.000]   which was really hard for her,
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.600]   and become the breadwinner for the family.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.220]   And he just felt like a failure.
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:53.600]   And I watched him go through that.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.780]   After all these years of letting that foot heal,
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:57.740]   we went out, first day,
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:57:59.480]   and we were splitting firewood with the splitter.
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:01.640]   And he was just so good to be back out, Jordan.
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.480]   It was so nice.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.200]   And he crushed his foot in the log splitter,
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.600]   and you're just like, no.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:07.600]   And so then they just amputated it.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.560]   We've got both legs amputated.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:11.920]   And then his health continued to decline.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:13.360]   He lost his movement in his hands.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:16.120]   So he was like incapacitated to a degree,
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:17.080]   and in a lot of pain.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:19.160]   I would hear him at night in pain all the time.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:22.440]   And I delayed a trip back to Russia
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.920]   and just stayed with my dad for those last six months.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:29.400]   And it was so interesting having had lost everything.
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.660]   I've watched him wrestle with it through the years.
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:34.280]   But then he found his joy and his purpose
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:37.580]   just in being almost, I mean, a vegetable.
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:40.140]   I'd have to help him pee, roll him onto the cot,
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.320]   take him to dialysis.
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:43.460]   But we would laugh.
[01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:47.680]   He would hear him at night crying, or in pain, like, ah!
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.560]   And then in the morning,
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.720]   he'd have encouraging words to say.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:55.720]   And I was like, wow, that's how you face loss and suffering.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:59.880]   And he must have gotten that somehow from his parents.
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:01.720]   And then I find myself on this show,
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:05.560]   and I had a thought, why is this easy to me, in a way?
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:07.560]   Why is this thing that's, and I was like,
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:09.320]   and it just felt like this gift
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:11.320]   that it kind of handed down,
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:13.400]   and now it would be my duty to hand down.
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:16.560]   But it's kind of an interesting thought.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.680]   - And be the beacon of that,
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:19.720]   represent that kind of perseverance
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:24.720]   in the simpler way that something like survival
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:26.400]   in the wilderness shows.
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.360]   - Yeah. - It's the same.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.360]   It rhymes.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:30.880]   - It rhymes, and it's so simple.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.680]   Like, the lessons are simple,
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:35.180]   and so we can take 'em and apply 'em.
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:36.820]   - So that's on the survivor side.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:39.920]   What about on the people committing the atrocities?
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:42.080]   What do you make of the Ottomans,
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:44.680]   what they did to Armenians, or the Nazis,
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.240]   what they did to the Jews, the Slavs,
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.920]   and basically everyone?
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:52.560]   What do you, why do you think people do evil in this world?
[01:59:52.560 --> 02:00:00.280]   - It's interesting that, it's really easy, right?
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:02.800]   It's really easy, you can almost sense it in yourself
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:07.800]   to justify, to justify a little bit of evil,
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.840]   or you see yourself cheer a little bit
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.720]   when the enemy gets knocked back in some way.
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:17.760]   It's really, in a way, it's just perfectly natural,
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:21.680]   for us to feed that hate, and feed that tribalism,
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:23.780]   in-group, out-group, we're on this team.
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:26.600]   And I think that can happen,
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.480]   I think it just happens slowly,
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:33.180]   like one justification at a time, one step at a time.
[02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:38.320]   You hear something, and it makes you think,
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:41.240]   then, that you are in the right to perform some kind of,
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.520]   you know, you're justified, and, you know,
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.680]   break a couple eggs to make an omelet type thing.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.800]   And then, but all of a sudden that takes you down
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:53.360]   this whole train, to where pretty soon,
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.960]   you're justifying what's completely unjustifiable.
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.560]   - It's just gradual.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.400]   - Yeah.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.960]   - It's a gradual process, of a little bit at a time.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:07.880]   - I think that's why, for me, having a path of faith,
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:09.720]   is like, works as like a mooring,
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.160]   because it can help me shine that light on myself.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.120]   You know, it's like something else,
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:14.440]   'cause if you're just looking at yourself,
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:19.440]   and looking within yourself for your compass in life,
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:21.840]   it's really easy to get that thing out of whack,
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.280]   but you kind of need a perspective
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.340]   from which you can step out of yourself,
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:29.560]   and look into yourself, and judge yourself accordingly.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.080]   And am I walking in line with that ideal?
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:36.840]   You know, and then, I think without that check,
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:40.020]   your subject, you know, it's easy to ignore the fact
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.400]   that you might be able to commit those things,
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:45.520]   but we live in a pretty easy, comfortable society.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:49.140]   Like, what if, you know, what if we pictured yourself
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:51.600]   in the position of my grandparents,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.720]   and then, all of a sudden, you got the upper hand
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:55.360]   in some kind of a fight?
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.200]   What are you gonna do?
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:58.640]   You know, you could definitely picture
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.360]   becoming evil in that situation.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.360]   - I think one thing faith in God can do
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.800]   is humble you before these kinds of complexities
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:16.480]   of the world, and humility is a way
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:20.100]   to avoid the slippery slope towards evil, I think.
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:23.800]   Humility that you don't know who the good guys
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:26.840]   and the bad guys are, and you defer that
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.420]   to sort of bigger powers to try to understand that.
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:32.260]   - Yeah.
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:34.120]   - I think there's a kind of, I mean,
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.280]   a lot of the atrocities were committed
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:41.280]   by people who are very sure of themselves being good.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.360]   - Yeah, that's so true.
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:46.960]   - It is sad that religion is, at times,
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:51.960]   used as a way to kind of, as yet another tool
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:57.840]   for justification, which is a sad application of religion.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:00.360]   - It really is.
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.760]   It's so inherent and so natural in us
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:07.080]   to justify ourselves, it's really,
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.600]   I mean, I think it's almost,
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.360]   I mean, just understanding history,
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:15.840]   you read history, it blows my mind that,
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:19.460]   and I'm super thankful that somehow,
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:20.760]   and this has been misused so much,
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:23.560]   but somehow this ideology arose that,
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:27.680]   love your enemies, forgive, forgive those
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:32.680]   that persecute you, and just on down the line,
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.200]   that something like that rose in the world
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:39.240]   into a position where we all kind of accept those ideals,
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:44.120]   I think is really remarkable and worth appreciating.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:47.360]   That said, a lot of that gets wrapped up
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:49.480]   in what you're talking, you know,
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:51.520]   what is so natural just becomes another instrument
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.560]   for tribalism or another justification for wrong,
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.840]   and so I, even myself, am self-conscious
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.640]   sometimes talking about matters of faith
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:00.800]   because I know when I'm talking about it,
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:04.160]   I'm talking about something else other than,
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.920]   you know, other than what someone else might think of
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.040]   when they hear me talking about it, so it's interesting.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.120]   - Yeah, I've been listening to Jordan Peterson
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.840]   talk about this, he has a way of articulating things,
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:18.040]   which are sometimes hard to understand in the moment,
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.800]   but when I read it carefully afterwards,
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:21.960]   it starts to make more sense.
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:24.560]   I've heard him talk about religion and God
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.400]   as a kind of base layer, like a metaphorical substrate
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.440]   from which morality of our sense
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.480]   of what is right and wrong comes from,
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:38.040]   and just our conceptions of what is beautiful in life.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:42.960]   All these kinds of higher things that are like fuzzy,
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.280]   understand? - Mm-hmm.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.140]   - That their religion helps create this substrate
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:50.720]   from which we as a species, like as a civilization,
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:52.360]   can come up with these notions,
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:55.760]   and without it, you are lost at sea.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:59.520]   - I guess for him, morality requires that substrate.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:01.080]   - Like you said, it's kind of fuzzy,
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:04.600]   so I've only been able to get clear vision of it
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:07.880]   when I live it, and it's not something you profess
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:09.320]   or anything like that, it's something
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:13.560]   that you take seriously and apply in your life,
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:16.600]   and when you live it, then there's some clarity there,
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:19.880]   but that it has to be kind of defined,
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:22.360]   like it's like, and that's where you come in
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:23.680]   with the religion and the stories,
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:26.640]   because if you leave it completely undefined,
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.120]   I don't really know where you go from there.
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.960]   I actually, isn't it funny to speak to that?
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:36.360]   I did mushroom, have you ever done those before?
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:38.100]   - Mushrooms, yeah.
[02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:40.320]   - I've done 'em a couple times, but one time was,
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.320]   didn't do that many, the other time, more,
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:45.960]   and I had a really profound experience
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:50.960]   in helping couch all this in a proper context for myself,
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:54.200]   so when I did it, I remember I was sitting on a swing
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:56.800]   and I could see my, everything was so blissful,
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.120]   except I could see my black hands on these chains,
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.360]   like on the swing, but everything else was blissful
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:06.560]   and kind of amorphous, and I could see the outline
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:09.480]   of my kids, and I could just feel the love for them,
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:11.720]   and I was just like, man, I just feel the love,
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:16.120]   it's so wonderful, but then at times I would try
[02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:18.000]   to picture 'em, and I couldn't quite picture the kids,
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.800]   but I could feel the love, and then I started asking
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.680]   all the deepest existential questions I could,
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:25.880]   and it felt like I was just one answer,
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:27.240]   another answer, another answer,
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:29.600]   everything was being answered, and I felt like
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:32.280]   I was communing with God, whatever you wanna say,
[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:36.000]   but I was very aware of the fact that that communing
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.320]   was just peeling back the tiniest corner of the infinite,
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:41.820]   and it just dumped me with every answer
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:46.660]   I felt like I could have, and it kind of blew me away,
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:49.880]   so then I asked it, well, if you're the infinite,
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:51.320]   why did you reveal to me yourself?
[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:55.480]   Why did you use the story of Jesus to reveal yourself?
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:07:00.480]   And then that infinite, amorphous thing
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:05.880]   had to somehow take form for us to be able to relate to it,
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:08.600]   it had to have some kind of a form,
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.660]   but whenever you create a form out of something,
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:14.840]   you're boxing it in and subjugating it to boundaries
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:18.120]   and stuff like that, and then that subject to pain
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.000]   and subject to the brokenness and all that,
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.200]   and I was like, oh, wow, but when I had that thought,
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:25.880]   then all of a sudden, I could relate my dark hands
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:27.960]   on the chains to the rest of the experience,
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:30.720]   and then all of a sudden, I could picture my children
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.200]   as the children rather than this amorphous feeling of love.
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.840]   It was like, oh, there's Elan and Altai and Zion,
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:42.040]   but then they were bounded, and then once they're bounded,
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:44.760]   you're subject to the death and to the misunderstanding
[02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:49.200]   and to all that, and I picture the amoeba or the cell,
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:53.160]   and then when it dies, it turns into a unformed thing,
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:57.280]   and so we need some kind of form to relate to,
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.800]   so instead of always just talking about God
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:02.440]   completely intangibly, it kind of gave me a way
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:04.200]   to relate to it, and I was like, oh, wow,
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:07.640]   that was really powerful to me in putting it
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:12.120]   in a context that was applicable.
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:17.120]   - But ultimately, God is the thing that's formless,
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:23.040]   that is unbounded, but we humans need,
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:26.800]   I mean, that's the purpose of stories,
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:28.800]   they resonate with something in us,
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:31.960]   but when you need the bounded nature,
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:33.640]   the constraints of those stories,
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:36.200]   otherwise we wouldn't be able to--
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.040]   - Relate to it.
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:40.640]   - Can't relate to it, and then when you look
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:43.520]   at the stories literally, or you just look at 'em
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.520]   just as they are, it seems silly.
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.800]   It's just too simplistic.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.800]   - Right, right, and then that was always,
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:56.080]   a lot of my family and loved ones and friends
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.120]   have completely left the faith, and I totally,
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.000]   in a way, I get it, I understand,
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.400]   but I also really see the baby that's being thrown out
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.800]   with the bathwater, and I want to cherish that
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:08.800]   in a way, I guess.
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:11.400]   - And it's interesting that you say that
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:13.560]   the way to know what's right and wrong
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:15.760]   is you have to live it.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.320]   Sometimes it's probably very difficult to articulate,
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:24.160]   but in the living of it, do you realize it?
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.240]   - Yeah, and I'm glad you say that,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.160]   because I found a lot of comfort in that,
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:31.320]   because I feel somewhat inarticulate a lot of the times,
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:33.120]   and unable to articulate my thoughts,
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:36.440]   especially on these matters, and then you just think,
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.840]   I just have to, but I do have to, I can live it.
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:41.840]   I can try to live it, and then what I also am struck with
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:44.520]   right away is I can't, 'cause you can't love everybody.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.680]   You can't love your enemies, and you can't,
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:50.840]   but as placing that in front of you as the ideal
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:54.840]   is so important to put a check on your human instincts,
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:59.840]   on your tribalism, on your, I mean, you can very quickly,
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:02.920]   like we talked about with evil,
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:06.160]   it can really quickly take its place in your life.
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:09.440]   I almost, you almost won't observe it happening,
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:14.440]   but, and so I so much appreciate all the, me striving,
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:17.800]   and that's where, I grew up in a Christian family,
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:21.520]   so I had these cliches that I didn't really understand,
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:24.680]   like a relationship with God, like what does that mean?
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:28.360]   But then I realized when I struggled with trying,
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:30.920]   with taking, I actually did try to take it seriously,
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.280]   and struggle with what does it mean
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.800]   to live out a life of love in the world,
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.600]   but that's like a wrestling match,
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:37.720]   'cause it's not that simple.
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.400]   It doesn't sound, it sounds good,
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:42.960]   but it's really hard to do, and then you realize
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:46.840]   you can't do it perfectly, but in that struggle,
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:49.200]   in that wrestling match is where I actually sensed
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.920]   that relationship, and then it's,
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:53.520]   and that's where it kind of gains life,
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.000]   and how that, and I'm sure that relates
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.000]   to what Jordan Peterson is getting at in his metaphor.
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.720]   - Yeah, in the striving of the ideal,
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:09.520]   in the striving towards the ideal,
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:13.800]   you discover the, how to be a better person.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:16.440]   - One thing I noticed really tangibly on "Alone"
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.360]   was that because I had so many people that were close to me
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.080]   kind of just leave it all together,
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:22.480]   I was like, I could do that.
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:26.880]   I actually understand why they do, or I could not.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:29.880]   I do have a choice, and so I had to choose at that point
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:34.880]   to maintain that ideal, and, 'cause I could add enough time
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:38.120]   on "Alone," one nice thing is you don't have any distractions.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:40.240]   You have all the time in the world to go into your head,
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:44.160]   and I could play those paths out in my life,
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.360]   and not only in my life, but I feel like societally
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.720]   and generationally, I throw it all away,
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:52.320]   and everybody start from square one,
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:57.320]   or we can try to redeem what's valuable in this
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:02.400]   and wrestle with it, and so I just chose that path.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:06.440]   - Well, I do think it's a kind of wrestling match,
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.040]   'cause you mentioned Gulag Archipelago.
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.720]   I'm very much a believer that we all have the capacity
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:16.760]   for good and evil, and striving for the ideal
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.540]   to be a good human being is not a trivial one.
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:23.780]   You have to find the right tools for yourself
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:27.040]   to be able to be the candle, as you mentioned before.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:27.880]   - I get it.
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:32.160]   - And then for that, religion and faith can help.
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:34.720]   I'm sure there's other ways, but I think it's grounded
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:38.720]   in understanding that each human is able to be
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:42.640]   a really bad person and a really good person,
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:46.480]   and that's like a choice, it's a deliberate choice,
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:48.920]   and it's a choice that's taken every moment
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:53.920]   and builds up over time, and the hard part about it
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.240]   is you don't know, you don't always have the clarity,
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.480]   using reason to understand what is good,
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.000]   what is right, and what is wrong.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.880]   You have to kind of live it with humility
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:09.520]   and constantly struggle, 'cause then, yeah,
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.340]   you might wake up in a society
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:15.920]   where you're committing genocides,
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:19.600]   and you think you're the good guys,
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:21.880]   and I think you have to have the courage
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:23.180]   to realize you're not.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:25.800]   It's not always obvious.
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:27.100]   - It isn't, man.
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:30.520]   - And only history has the clarity to show
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:33.720]   who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:35.320]   - Right, you gotta wrestle with it.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:39.040]   It's like that quote, the line between good and evil
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:40.760]   goes through the heart of every man,
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:43.480]   and we push it this way and that,
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:47.880]   and our job is to work on that within ourselves.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:53.060]   - Yeah, that's the part that's what I like,
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:56.120]   sort of the full quote talks about the fact
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:01.120]   that it moves, the line moves moment by moment,
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.360]   day by day.
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:07.360]   We have the freedom to move that line.
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:10.640]   So it's a very deliberate thing.
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:13.440]   It's not like you're born this way, and that's it.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.360]   - Yeah, I agree.
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:20.360]   - And especially in conditions that are like war and peace,
[02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:26.300]   in the case of the camps, absurd levels of injustice
[02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:30.580]   in the face of all that.
[02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:32.020]   When everything is taken away from you,
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:34.860]   you still have the choice to be the candle,
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:36.180]   like the grandmas.
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:40.580]   By the way, grandmas in all parts of the world
[02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:41.760]   are like the strongest humans.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.700]   - Shout out to the grandmas, seriously.
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:46.940]   - It's like, I don't know what it is.
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:50.320]   I don't know, they have this wisdom
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:54.240]   that comes from patience and have seen it all,
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.920]   have seen all the bullshit of the people
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.960]   that come and gone, all the abuses of power,
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:01.480]   all of this, I don't know what it is,
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:03.240]   and they just keep going.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:04.080]   - Right, right.
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.660]   Yeah, it's so true.
[02:15:07.660 --> 02:15:13.120]   - What do you think of, as we've gotten a bit philosophical,
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:16.360]   what do you think of Werner Herzog's style
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.380]   of narration?
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:19.260]   I kind of wish he narrated my life.
[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:22.340]   - Yeah, it's amazing to listen to.
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:26.100]   - 'Cause that documentary's actually in Russian.
[02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:30.660]   I think he took a longer series, yeah,
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:33.780]   and then put narration over it.
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:38.060]   And that narration can transform a story.
[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:40.300]   - Yeah, he does an incredible job with it.
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:43.460]   I will say, have you seen the full version?
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:45.580]   Have you watched the four-part full version?
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:46.600]   - You should, you'd like it.
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:49.500]   It's in Russian, and so you'll get the fullness of that.
[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:53.000]   He had to fit it into a two-hour format,
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000]   and so I think what you lose in those extra couple hours
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.820]   is worth watching, and I think you'll like it.
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:03.140]   - Yeah, they always go pretty dark.
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:03.980]   - Do they?
[02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:06.800]   - He has a very dark sense about nature
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:09.400]   that is violence and it's murder.
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:11.400]   - I think that's important to recognize
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:13.940]   because it's really easy, I mean,
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:16.680]   especially with what I do and what I talk about,
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:19.640]   and I see so much of the value in nature.
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:24.040]   Gosh, I also see a beautiful moose
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:26.400]   and a calf running around, and then next week,
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:28.500]   I see the calf ripped to shreds by wolves,
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:30.040]   and you're just like, "Ugh!"
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.040]   And it's not as Rousseauian as we'd like to think.
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:44.180]   Things must die for things to live, like you said,
[02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:46.540]   and that's just played out all the time,
[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:48.380]   and it's indifferent to you,
[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:51.080]   doesn't care if you live or die,
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:52.560]   and doesn't care how you die
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:55.140]   or how much pain you go through while you die.
[02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:58.640]   It's pretty brutal, so it's interesting
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:01.560]   that he taps into that, and I think it's valuable
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:05.400]   because it's easy to idealize in a way.
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:06.900]   - Yeah, the indifference is,
[02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:09.820]   I don't know what to make of it.
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:11.640]   There isn't indifference.
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:14.240]   It's a bit scary, it's a bit lonely.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.760]   You're just a cog in the machine of nature
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:21.540]   that doesn't really care for you.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:22.380]   - Totally.
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:25.400]   I think that's something I've sat with a lot on that show.
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:26.920]   It's another part of the depths
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:29.320]   of your psychology to delve into,
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:34.320]   and that's when I thought, I understand that deeply,
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:36.920]   but I could also choose to believe
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:38.320]   that for some reason it matters,
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:40.460]   and then I could live like it matters,
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:42.180]   and then I could see the trajectories,
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:45.780]   and that was another fork in the road of my path, I guess.
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:48.020]   - What do you think about the connection to the animals,
[02:17:48.020 --> 02:17:50.900]   though, in that movie, it's with the dogs,
[02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:55.060]   and with you, it's the other domesticated, the reindeer.
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:59.780]   What do you think about that human-animal connection?
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:01.060]   - In the context of that indifference,
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:04.360]   it's interesting that we assign so much value
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:06.820]   and love and appreciation for these animals,
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:09.620]   and in some degree, we get that back in a reciprocal.
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:11.740]   I think right now, you just said the reindeer.
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:13.680]   I think of the one they gave me,
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:16.220]   'cause he was long and tall, so they named him Dlinni,
[02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:19.180]   and I just remember Dlinni,
[02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:20.780]   and just watching him eat the leaves
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:22.220]   and go with me through the woods
[02:18:22.220 --> 02:18:24.820]   and trust him to take me through rivers and stuff,
[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:28.580]   and it really is special.
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:32.980]   It's really enriching to have that relationship
[02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:35.660]   with an animal, and I think it also puts you
[02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:36.620]   in a proper context.
[02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:37.940]   One thing I noticed about the natives
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:39.720]   who live with those animals all the time
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:44.380]   is they relate to life and death a little more naturally.
[02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:46.260]   We feel really removed from it,
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:47.580]   particularly in urban settings,
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:51.500]   and I think when you interact with animals
[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:54.760]   and you have to confront the life and the death of them
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:59.200]   and the responsibility of a symbiotic relationship you have,
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:02.720]   I think it opens a little bit of awareness
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:06.100]   to your place in the puzzle,
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:10.580]   and puts you in it rather than above it.
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:13.520]   - Have you been able to accept your own death?
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:16.860]   - I wonder, you know, you wonder when it actually comes,
[02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:21.860]   what you're gonna think, but I did have my dad to watch,
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:27.060]   confront it in as positive a manner as you could,
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:29.700]   and that's a big advantage,
[02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:34.700]   and so I think when the time comes that I will be ready,
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:39.340]   but I think that's easy to say when the time feels far off.
[02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:40.480]   You know, it'll be interesting
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.420]   if you got a cancer diagnosis tomorrow in stage four.
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:45.860]   It's like, be heavy.
[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:47.000]   - Did you ever confront death
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.660]   while in survival situations?
[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:50.580]   I mean, when you're, I mean, you're in--
[02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:54.580]   - I did have a time where I thought I might,
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:55.500]   I was gonna die.
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:58.260]   I had a lot of situations that could've gone either way,
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:01.020]   and a lot of injuries, broken ribs and this and that,
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:05.000]   but the one that I was able to be conscious
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.340]   through a slowly evolving experience
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:09.220]   that I thought I might die in was,
[02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:12.140]   at one point, we were siphoning gas out of a barrel,
[02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:13.340]   and it was almost to the bottom,
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:14.900]   and I was like, so it's sucking really hard
[02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:18.220]   to get the gas out, and then I didn't get the siphon going,
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:20.780]   so I waited, and then while I was sitting there,
[02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:24.540]   Eura put a new canister on top and put the hose in,
[02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:29.180]   and I didn't see, and so then I went to get another siphon,
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:31.300]   and I went, like, sucked as hard as I could,
[02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:33.860]   and it just instantly, like, a bunch of gas filled my mouth,
[02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:35.360]   and I couldn't, like, spit it out.
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.120]   I had to go, (gasps) like that,
[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:40.740]   and I just, full mouthful of gas that I just drank,
[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:43.560]   and I was just like, oh, like, what is that gonna do?
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:48.560]   And he and my friend were gonna go on this fishing trip,
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:50.920]   and so was I, and I was just like, oh, I might just stay,
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:52.440]   and I was in this little Russian village,
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:55.660]   and they were like, all right, well.
[02:20:55.660 --> 02:20:59.120]   Eura was like, man, I had a buddy that died
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:01.080]   doing that with diesel a couple years ago,
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:03.420]   and I was like, oh, man, and so, anyway,
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:05.300]   I made my way to the hospital, and by then,
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:07.540]   you know, you're really out of it because,
[02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:11.260]   and then, and it was, they put me in this little dark room.
[02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:13.880]   It almost sounds, like, unrealistic,
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:15.180]   but it's actually how it happened.
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:20.180]   They put me in a little room with a toilet,
[02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:23.180]   and they gave me a cold, you know, galvanized bucket,
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:25.420]   and then, like, they just had a cold water faucet,
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:27.300]   and they're just like, just chug water,
[02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:29.300]   puke into the toilet, and just flush your system
[02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:32.060]   as much as you can, but they only had a cold water faucet,
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:33.940]   so I was just sitting there, like, chug, chug, chug, chug,
[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:36.260]   until, like, you puke, and chug until you puke,
[02:21:36.260 --> 02:21:38.860]   and I'm in the dark, and I, and I was, like,
[02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:40.860]   started to shiver 'cause I was so cold,
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:42.380]   but I said to, like, still, like,
[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:45.300]   get this thing up to me and chug until I puked.
[02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:47.340]   I was picturing, I remember reading, you know,
[02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:50.260]   about the Japanese torture, where they would put a hose
[02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:53.460]   in somebody and then make 'em drink water until they puked.
[02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:56.900]   Anyway, the, and I, and I just felt so,
[02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:59.260]   the only way I can express it, I felt so possessed,
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:01.820]   like, demon possessed, like, I was just permeated with gas.
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:03.780]   I could feel it, it was coming out of my pores,
[02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:06.020]   and I, like, wanted to, like, rip it out of me,
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:08.620]   and I couldn't, I'd, like, puke into the toilet,
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:10.860]   and then couldn't see, but I was wondering
[02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:13.460]   if it was, like, rainbow, you know, and then,
[02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:15.060]   and then I just remember, like, I could tell
[02:22:15.060 --> 02:22:20.020]   I was going out pretty soon, and I remember looking
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:22.100]   at my hands up close, I could see 'em a little bit,
[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.820]   and I, I was like, oh, that's how dad's hands looked,
[02:22:24.820 --> 02:22:26.460]   you know, they were alive, alive, and then,
[02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:28.220]   and then I was like, oh, puke, and I was like,
[02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:31.580]   oh, interesting, is it, are my hands gonna look like that
[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:33.540]   in a few minutes or whatever, and so then I wrote down,
[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:35.860]   like, to my family what I thought, you know,
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:40.540]   like, I love you all, like, feel at peace, blah, blah, blah,
[02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:43.980]   and then I passed out, and I woke up, but I didn't think,
[02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:46.600]   I actually thought, I, I'm not, when I went to pass out,
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:48.940]   I thought it was, there was a coin toss for me,
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:52.640]   so I really felt like I was confronting the end there.
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:55.580]   - What are the harshest conditions
[02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:57.060]   of surviving on Earth?
[02:22:57.060 --> 02:23:00.740]   - Well, there are places that are just purely uninhabitable,
[02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:04.420]   but I think as far as places that you have a chance--
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:06.780]   - You have a chance, that's a good way to put it.
[02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:10.600]   - Maybe Greenland, I think of Greenland because I think of,
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:12.380]   you know, those Vikings that settled there
[02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:16.900]   were rugged, capable dudes, and they didn't make it,
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:19.060]   but there are Inuit that, that, you know,
[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:23.000]   natives that live up there, but that's a hard life,
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.180]   you know, and the population's never grown very big,
[02:23:25.180 --> 02:23:26.940]   'cause they're, you're scraping by up there,
[02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:31.180]   and you picture, and the Vikings that did land there,
[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:34.500]   you know, they just weren't able to quite adapt,
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:37.660]   and the fact that they all died out is just a symbol,
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:40.340]   so that must be a pretty difficult place to live.
[02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:42.420]   - What would you say, that's primarily
[02:23:42.420 --> 02:23:44.700]   because just the food sources are limited?
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:46.660]   - Food sources are limited, but the fact
[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:49.100]   that some people can live there means it is possible,
[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:51.980]   you know, they've figured out ways to catch seals
[02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:56.180]   and do things to survive, but it's by no means
[02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:58.900]   easier to be taken for granted or obvious.
[02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:02.340]   I think it's a hard, probably a harsh place to try to live.
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:04.340]   - Yeah, it's fascinating, not just humans,
[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:08.500]   but to watch how animals have figured out how to survive.
[02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:10.700]   Watching like a documentary on polar bears,
[02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:13.460]   like, they just figure out a way,
[02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:16.180]   and they get, and they've been doing it for generations,
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:17.280]   and they figure out a way.
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:20.780]   They travel, like, hundreds of miles to like,
[02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:26.780]   to the water to get fat, and they travel 100 miles to like,
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:31.060]   for whatever other purpose, because they wanna stay
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:32.740]   on the ice, I don't know, but it's like,
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:35.900]   there's a process, and they figure it out
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:38.380]   against the long odds, and some of them don't make it.
[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:43.100]   - It's incredible, it's, what a, what tough things, man.
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:45.980]   You just think every little, every animal you see
[02:24:45.980 --> 02:24:47.620]   up in the mountains when I'm up in the woods,
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:48.900]   it's that thing just surviving
[02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:53.900]   through the winter scraping by, it's tough, tough existence.
[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:57.340]   - What do you think it would take to break you,
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:24:58.760]   let's say mentally?
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:03.000]   Like, if you're in a survival situation.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.420]   - I mean, I think it would have, mentally,
[02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:11.420]   it would have to be, well, we talked about that earlier,
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:15.500]   I guess, the thing that I've confronted
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:17.580]   that I thought I knew was that if I knew
[02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:20.580]   I was the last person on Earth, I wouldn't do it.
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:22.100]   Like, I thought, but maybe you're right,
[02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:24.360]   maybe I just would think I wasn't.
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:26.820]   But I think, you know, I can't imagine,
[02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:31.820]   I can't imagine, we're so blessed in the time we live,
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:35.740]   but I can't imagine what it's like to lose your kids,
[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:37.220]   something like that, it was an experience
[02:25:37.220 --> 02:25:40.200]   that was so common for humanity for so much of history.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:43.780]   Would I be able to endure that?
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:48.060]   I would have at least a legacy to look back on
[02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:52.060]   of people who did, but God forbid I ever have
[02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:55.060]   to delve that deep, you know what I mean?
[02:25:55.060 --> 02:25:57.100]   I could see that breaking somebody.
[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:59.540]   - And I mean, in your own family history,
[02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:01.660]   there's people who have survived that,
[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.140]   and maybe that would give you hope.
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:04.860]   - I mean, I think that's what I would have
[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:07.020]   to somehow hold on to.
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:08.620]   - But in a survival situation,
[02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:10.660]   there's very few things that--
[02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.340]   - I don't know what it would be.
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:15.940]   So on a loan, on a loan, I knew,
[02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:18.700]   I wasn't gonna, and ultimately, it is a game show.
[02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:21.580]   So it's like, ultimately, I wasn't gonna kill myself
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:26.580]   out there, but so if I hadn't been able
[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:30.140]   to procure food and I was starving to death,
[02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:32.780]   it's like, okay, I'm not, I'm gonna go home.
[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:35.620]   You know, but if you put yourself in that situation,
[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:36.980]   but it's not a game show,
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:41.060]   and having been there to some degree,
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:43.620]   I will say, I wasn't even close.
[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:44.700]   Like, I don't even know.
[02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:45.540]   - Yeah.
[02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:48.420]   - Yeah, I hadn't got, it hadn't pushed my mental limit
[02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:51.300]   at all yet, I would say, or on the scale.
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:53.140]   But that's not to say there isn't one.
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:56.580]   I know there is one, but I have a hard time.
[02:26:56.580 --> 02:26:59.980]   I know I've dealt with enough pain
[02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:03.000]   and enough discomfort in life
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.260]   that I know I can deal with that.
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:07.500]   I think it gets difficult when you start
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:10.540]   to, when there's a way out, and you start
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:12.900]   to wonder if you shouldn't take the way out,
[02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:17.300]   as far as like, if there's no way out,
[02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:19.740]   I don't know what to do.
[02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:20.780]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:25.060]   I mean, that is a real difficult battle
[02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:27.580]   when there's an exit, when it's easy to quit.
[02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:30.000]   - Right, yeah, why am I doing this?
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.000]   - Yeah, that's a thing that gets louder and louder
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.780]   the harder things get.
[02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:37.820]   - That voice.
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:39.140]   - It's not insignificant.
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:43.820]   Like, if you think you're doing permanent damage
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.640]   to your body, you would be smart to quit.
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:51.020]   You should just not do that when it's not necessary,
[02:27:51.020 --> 02:27:53.940]   because health is kinda all you have in some regards.
[02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:57.300]   So, I don't blame anyone, then they quit
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:59.300]   because of that reason, it's like, good.
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:04.220]   But if you're in a situation and you don't have
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:06.700]   the option to quit, is knowing that you're doing
[02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:08.860]   permanent, that's not gonna break, that won't break me.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:10.920]   You know, you just have to get through it.
[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:13.620]   I'm not sure what my mental limit would be
[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:18.100]   outside of like, the family suffering
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:19.720]   in the way that I described earlier.
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:22.340]   - When it's just you, it's you, you're alone,
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:26.340]   there's the limit, you don't know what the limit is.
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:27.180]   - I don't know the limit.
[02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:31.220]   - Injuries, like physical stuff is annoying, though.
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:32.140]   - Oh.
[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:32.980]   - That could be--
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:36.260]   - Isn't it weird how, I mean, I can have a good life,
[02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:37.980]   happy life, and then you have a bad back,
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:40.060]   or you have a headache, and it's amazing
[02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:42.340]   how much that can overwhelm your experience.
[02:28:42.340 --> 02:28:47.300]   Then, again, that was something I saw in Dad
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:51.540]   that was like, interesting, how can you find joy in that,
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:53.540]   when you're just steeped in that all the time?
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:55.580]   And people I'm sure listening, there's a lot of people
[02:28:55.580 --> 02:29:00.580]   that do, and it's so, and talk about the cross to bear,
[02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:04.060]   and the hero journey to be, like, good for you
[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:08.900]   for trying to find what you can, your way through that.
[02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:12.460]   There was a lady in Russia, Tanya,
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:15.620]   and she had cancer and recovered,
[02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:18.500]   but always had a pounding headache.
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:21.940]   And she was really joyful, and really fun to be around.
[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:25.220]   And I just like, man, I mean, you just have to have
[02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:27.220]   a really bad headache for today to know how much
[02:29:27.220 --> 02:29:29.780]   that throws a wrench in your existence.
[02:29:29.780 --> 02:29:33.380]   So, all that to say, if you're not right now
[02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:36.020]   suffering with blindness, or a bad back,
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:39.420]   or, just count your blessings, 'cause it is all,
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:42.740]   it's so easy to have, it's amazing how complex we are,
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:46.260]   how well our bodies work, and when they go out of whack,
[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:48.340]   it can be very overwhelming, and they all will
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:50.540]   at some point, and so that's an interesting thing
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:52.820]   to think ahead on, how you're gonna confront it
[02:29:52.820 --> 02:29:54.460]   when it does.
[02:29:54.460 --> 02:29:56.140]   Keeps you humble, like you said.
[02:29:56.140 --> 02:29:58.060]   - It's inspiring that people figure out a way.
[02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:00.700]   With migraines, that's a hard one, though.
[02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:01.900]   - You have headaches.
[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:02.740]   (laughing)
[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:04.220]   - It's so hard.
[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:05.860]   - Oh, man.
[02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:07.900]   'Cause those can be really painful.
[02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:09.260]   - It's overwhelming.
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:11.340]   - And dizzying, and all of this, ugh.
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:13.740]   (laughing)
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:16.060]   That's inspiring, that's inspiring that you found that.
[02:30:16.060 --> 02:30:17.700]   - There's not nothing in that.
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:22.660]   I mean, you can find, somehow you can tap into purpose,
[02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:23.860]   even in that pain.
[02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:26.500]   I guess I would just speak from my dad's experience.
[02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:29.820]   I saw somebody do it, and I benefited from it.
[02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:34.780]   So, thanks to him for seeing the higher calling there.
[02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:38.940]   - You wrote a note on your blog in 2012,
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:43.940]   you spent five weeks-ish in the forest alone.
[02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:46.300]   I just thought it was interesting, 'cause this is
[02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:49.780]   in contrast to on the show alone.
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:53.020]   You're really alone, like you're not talking to anybody,
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:56.420]   and you realize that, you're right.
[02:30:56.420 --> 02:30:58.900]   I remember at one point, after several weeks had passed,
[02:30:58.900 --> 02:31:01.540]   I wandered into a particularly beautiful part of the woods
[02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:03.860]   and exclaimed out loud, "Wow."
[02:31:03.860 --> 02:31:06.380]   It struck me that it was the first time I had heard
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:10.060]   my own voice in several weeks, with no one to talk to.
[02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:18.460]   Did your thoughts go into something like deep place?
[02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:21.780]   - Yeah, I'd say my mental life was really active.
[02:31:21.780 --> 02:31:27.340]   When you're that long alone, I'll tell you what you won't
[02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:30.260]   have is any of the skeletons in your closet
[02:31:30.260 --> 02:31:32.220]   that are still in your closet.
[02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:35.860]   You will be forced to confront every person.
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:40.380]   One thing, if you've cheated on your wife or something,
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:42.700]   you'll be confronted with the random dude
[02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:46.500]   you didn't say thank you to, and the issue
[02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:48.020]   that you didn't resolve.
[02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:51.380]   All this stuff that was long gone will come up,
[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:53.100]   and then you'll work through it, and you'll think
[02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:54.900]   how you should make it right.
[02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:59.700]   I had a lot of those thoughts while I was out there,
[02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:03.420]   and it was so interesting to see what you would
[02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:08.420]   just brush over and then confront it,
[02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:11.380]   because in our modern world, when you're always distracted,
[02:32:11.380 --> 02:32:14.700]   you're just never, ever gonna know until you take the time
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:17.060]   to be alone for a considerable amount of time.
[02:32:17.060 --> 02:32:18.900]   - Spend time hanging out with the skeletons.
[02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:21.660]   - Yeah, exactly. (laughs)
[02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:23.060]   I recommend it.
[02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:24.980]   - So you said you guide people.
[02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:27.820]   What are your favorite places to go to?
[02:32:27.820 --> 02:32:32.500]   - Well, if I tell 'em, then is everybody gonna go there?
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:35.820]   - I like how you actually have, it might be a YouTube video
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:38.860]   or your Instagram post where you give 'em a recommendation
[02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:41.020]   of the best fishing hole in the world,
[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:43.500]   and you give detailed instructions on how to get there,
[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:44.780]   but it's like a journey of a life.
[02:32:44.780 --> 02:32:46.380]   It's like a Lord of the Rings type of journey.
[02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:47.220]   - Right, right.
[02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:52.220]   No, I love the, there's a region that I definitely love.
[02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:55.180]   You know, there's a region that I definitely love
[02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:57.260]   in the States because it's special to me.
[02:32:57.260 --> 02:32:58.500]   I grew up there.
[02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:00.780]   Stuff like that, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana,
[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:02.460]   those are really cool places to me.
[02:33:02.460 --> 02:33:05.580]   I like the small town vibes they're still maintaining
[02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:06.420]   and stuff there.
[02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:09.780]   - Just a mix of like mountains and forests.
[02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:12.780]   - Mm-hmm, but you know another really awesome place
[02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:15.780]   that blew my mind was New Zealand,
[02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:19.540]   that South Island of New Zealand was pretty incredible.
[02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:22.580]   As far as just stunning stuff to see,
[02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:24.820]   I was pretty high up there on the list.
[02:33:24.820 --> 02:33:29.460]   But all these places have such kind of unique things
[02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:32.580]   about Canada became, like where they did a loan,
[02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:35.340]   it's not typically what you'd say
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:37.480]   because it's fairly flat and cliffy and stuff,
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:39.100]   but it really became beautiful to me
[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:41.620]   'cause I could tap into the richness of the land,
[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:45.300]   you know, or the fishing hole thing.
[02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:47.100]   It's like that's a special little spot,
[02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:48.180]   you know, something like that.
[02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:50.220]   And you see the beauty, and then you start to see
[02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:52.660]   the beauty in the smaller scale.
[02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:54.300]   Like, oh, look at that little meadow with that,
[02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:56.500]   it's got an orange and a pink and a blue flower
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:58.220]   right next to each other, that's super cool.
[02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:01.260]   You know, and there's a million things like that.
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:02.900]   - Have you been back there yet?
[02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:05.020]   Back to where the loan show was?
[02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:07.580]   - No, we're going back this summer.
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:09.940]   I'm gonna guide a trip up there, take a bunch of people.
[02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:12.340]   I'm really looking forward to being able to enjoy it
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:16.540]   without the pressure of, it's gonna be a fun trip.
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:18.220]   - What advice would you give to people
[02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:23.220]   in terms of how to be in nature?
[02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:27.060]   So, like, hikes to take or journeys to take out in nature
[02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:29.260]   where it could take you to that place
[02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:32.060]   where the busyness and the madness of the world
[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:36.860]   can dissipate and you can be with it.
[02:34:36.860 --> 02:34:38.380]   Like, how long does it take for you,
[02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:40.540]   for people usually, to just like--
[02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:42.940]   - Yeah, I think you need a few days probably
[02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:44.420]   to really tap into it.
[02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:46.700]   But maybe you need to work your way there.
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:50.700]   It's awesome to go out on a hike,
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:52.860]   go see some beautiful little waterfall,
[02:34:52.860 --> 02:34:56.220]   or go see some old tree, or whatever it is.
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:35:01.340]   But I think just doing is it.
[02:35:01.340 --> 02:35:03.180]   Everybody thinks about doing it.
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:05.140]   You just really do do it.
[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:08.380]   Like, go out and then plan to go overnight.
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:12.100]   Don't be so afraid of all the potentialities
[02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:15.260]   that you delay it inevitably.
[02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:17.940]   It's actually one of the things that I've enjoyed
[02:35:17.940 --> 02:35:21.820]   the most about guiding people is giving them the tools
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:24.860]   so that now they have this ability into the future.
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:26.100]   You can go out and feel like,
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:29.380]   "I'm gonna pick this spot on the map and go there."
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:33.180]   And that's a tool in your toolkit of life
[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:34.580]   that is, I think, really valuable
[02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:39.140]   because I think everybody should spend some time in nature.
[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:42.820]   I mean, I think it's been pretty proven healthy.
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:45.780]   - Yeah, I mean, camping is great.
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:49.020]   And solo, a guy and she has to do it solo is pretty cool.
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:50.460]   - Yeah, that's cool you did.
[02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:51.280]   - Yeah, it's cool.
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:53.700]   And I recorded stuff, so that helped.
[02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:54.540]   - Oh, good, yeah.
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:56.860]   - So you sit there and you record the thoughts.
[02:35:56.860 --> 02:35:59.300]   Actually, for having to record the thoughts,
[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:01.900]   I had to like, it forced me to really think through
[02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:05.240]   what I was feeling to convert the feelings into words,
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:08.580]   which is not a trivial thing
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:12.420]   because it's mostly just feeling.
[02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:15.660]   You feel a certain kind of way.
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:18.260]   - That's interesting.
[02:36:18.260 --> 02:36:20.940]   You know, I felt like the way I met my wife
[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:22.580]   was like we met at this wedding
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:24.660]   and then I went to Russia, basically.
[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:28.860]   And we kept in touch via email for that year.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:32.020]   And a similar thing, it was really interesting to be,
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:34.300]   I have to be so thoughtful and purposeful
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:36.140]   about what you're saying and things.
[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:40.540]   Like, I think it's probably a healthy, good thing to do.
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:42.380]   - What gives you hope about this whole thing
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:47.180]   we have going on, the future of human civilization?
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:49.340]   - If we talk, you know, we talked about gratitude earlier.
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:50.700]   Like, look at what we have now.
[02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:51.700]   That could give you hope.
[02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:54.380]   Like, look at what we've, the world we're in.
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:57.580]   We live in such an amazing time with, you know.
[02:36:57.580 --> 02:36:58.740]   - Buildings and roads.
[02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:01.180]   - Buildings and roads and food security.
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:03.340]   And, you know, I lived with the natives
[02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:04.740]   and I thought to myself a lot,
[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:06.220]   like, I wonder if not everybody
[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:07.420]   would choose this way of life.
[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:10.460]   Because it is, there's something really rich
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:13.420]   about just that small group,
[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:17.220]   your direct relationship to your needs, all that.
[02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:21.020]   But with the food security and the, you know,
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:23.780]   modern medicine, the things that we now have
[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:26.020]   that we take for granted but that,
[02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:29.220]   I wouldn't choose that life if we didn't have those things.
[02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:31.420]   Otherwise, you're gonna watch your family starve to death
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:32.420]   or things like that.
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:38.180]   So we have so much now, which should lead us to be hopeful
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:40.540]   while we try to improve
[02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:42.860]   because there's definitely a lot of things wrong,
[02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:47.380]   you know, but I guess there's a lot of room for improvement
[02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:49.140]   and I do feel like we're sort of watching it,
[02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:51.060]   walking on a knife's edge, you know.
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:54.780]   But I guess that's the way it is.
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:57.180]   - As the tools we build become more powerful.
[02:37:57.180 --> 02:37:58.740]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:37:59.580]   (laughs)
[02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:02.300]   - Knife's edge is getting sharper and sharper.
[02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:07.860]   I've talked, I'll like argue with my brother about that.
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:09.940]   Sometimes he takes the more positive view
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:12.660]   and I'm like, ooh, I mean, it's great, we've done great,
[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:16.540]   but man, more and more people with nuclear weapons
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:19.540]   and more, it's just gonna take one mistake
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:21.540]   with the more power.
[02:38:21.540 --> 02:38:23.300]   - I think there's something about the sharpness
[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:28.300]   of the knife's edge that gets humanity to really focus
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:31.940]   and like step up and not screw it up.
[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:34.580]   There is, just like you said with the cold,
[02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:36.940]   going out into the extreme cold,
[02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:38.900]   it like wakes you up.
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:39.940]   And I think it's the same thing
[02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:42.620]   when nuclear weapons is just like wakes up humanity,
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:43.820]   like let's not screw this up.
[02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:44.900]   - Everybody was half asleep.
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:45.740]   - Exactly.
[02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:46.780]   (laughs)
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:48.860]   And then we keep building more and more powerful things
[02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:50.300]   to make sure we stay awake.
[02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:52.900]   - Yeah, exactly, stay awake, see what we've done,
[02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:55.100]   be thankful for it, but then improve it.
[02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:59.460]   And then, of course, I appreciated your little post
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:01.180]   the other week where you said you wanted some kids.
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:04.540]   You know, that's a very direct way to relate to the future
[02:39:04.540 --> 02:39:06.140]   and to have hope for the future.
[02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:07.500]   - I can't wait.
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:09.860]   And hopefully I also get a chance to go out
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:11.300]   in the wilderness with you at some point.
[02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:12.140]   - I would love it.
[02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:12.980]   - That'd be fun.
[02:39:12.980 --> 02:39:14.060]   - Open invite, let's make it happen.
[02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:16.020]   I got some really cool spots of it.
[02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:17.980]   Have in mind to take you.
[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:19.460]   - Awesome, let's go.
[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:20.700]   Thank you for talking today, brother.
[02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:22.540]   Thank you for everything you stand for.
[02:39:22.540 --> 02:39:23.380]   - Thanks, man.
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:26.620]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:28.160]   with Jordan Jonas.
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:29.340]   To support this podcast,
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:31.900]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:39:31.900 --> 02:39:35.620]   And now, let me try a new thing
[02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:37.900]   where I try to articulate some things
[02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.080]   I've been thinking about,
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:40.820]   whether prompted by one of your questions
[02:39:40.820 --> 02:39:42.800]   or just in general.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:44.540]   If you'd like to submit a question,
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:47.600]   including an audio and video form,
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:50.480]   go to lexfriedman.com/ama.
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:55.360]   Now, allow me to comment on the attempted assassination
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:57.320]   of Donald Trump on July 13th.
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:00.640]   First, as I've posted online,
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:02.540]   wishing Donald Trump good health
[02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:05.380]   after an assassination attempt
[02:40:05.380 --> 02:40:07.220]   is not a partisan statement.
[02:40:07.220 --> 02:40:08.380]   It's a human statement.
[02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:13.000]   And I'm sorry if some of you want to categorize me
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.620]   and other people into blue and red bins.
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:20.160]   Perhaps you do it because it's easier to hate
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:21.680]   than to understand.
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:23.240]   In this case, it shouldn't matter.
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:25.160]   But let me say, once again,
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:28.120]   that I am not right-wing nor left-wing.
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:29.620]   I'm not partisan.
[02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:31.560]   I make up my mind one issue at a time,
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:34.760]   and I try to approach everyone and every idea
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:38.100]   with empathy and with an open mind.
[02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:40.420]   I have and will continue to have
[02:40:40.420 --> 02:40:42.940]   many long-form conversations
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:46.360]   with people both on the left and the right.
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:50.440]   Now, onto the much more important point.
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:53.200]   The attempted assassination of Donald Trump
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.040]   should serve as a reminder
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:58.800]   that history can turn on a single moment.
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:01.500]   World War I started with the assassination
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:03.680]   of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:06.740]   And just like that, one moment in history,
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:11.740]   on June 18th, 1914, led to the death of 20 million people,
[02:41:11.740 --> 02:41:14.240]   half of whom were civilians.
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:18.040]   If one of the bullets on July 13th
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:20.360]   had a slightly different trajectory,
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:22.520]   where Donald Trump would end up dying
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:25.000]   in that small town in Pennsylvania,
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.080]   history would write a new dramatic chapter,
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:31.320]   the contents of which all the so-called experts
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:33.960]   and pundits would not be able to predict.
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:37.560]   It very well could have led to a civil war,
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:39.220]   because the true depth of the division
[02:41:39.220 --> 02:41:41.040]   in the country is unknown.
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:45.120]   We only see the surface turmoil on social media and so on.
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:47.320]   And it is events like the assassination
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:48.880]   of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:52.760]   where we as a human species get to find out
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:56.100]   what the truth is of where people really stand.
[02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:59.980]   The task then is to try and make our society
[02:41:59.980 --> 02:42:02.280]   maximally resilient and robust
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:04.480]   to such destabilizing events.
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:06.600]   The way to do that, I think,
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:10.560]   is to properly identify the threat, the enemy.
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:14.760]   It's not the left or the right that are the, quote, enemy.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:17.600]   Extreme division itself is the enemy.
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:19.760]   Some division is productive.
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:22.520]   It's how we develop good ideas and policies.
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:26.280]   But too much leads to the spread of resentment and hate
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:30.040]   that can boil over into destruction on a global scale.
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:35.040]   So we must absolutely avoid the slide into extreme division.
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:36.720]   There are many ways to do this,
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:39.720]   and perhaps it's a discussion for another time.
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:42.280]   But at the very basic level,
[02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:44.760]   let's continuously try to turn down the temperature
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:48.000]   of the partisan bickering and more often celebrate
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.360]   our obvious common humanity.
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:54.260]   Now, let me also comment on conspiracy theories.
[02:42:54.260 --> 02:42:57.200]   I've been hearing a lot of those recently.
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:00.040]   I think they play an important role in society.
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:03.000]   They ask questions that serve as a check on power
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.040]   and corruption of centralized institutions.
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:08.180]   The way to answer the questions raised
[02:43:08.180 --> 02:43:11.200]   by conspiracy theories is not by dismissing them
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.080]   with arrogance and feigned ignorance,
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:17.520]   but with transparency and accountability.
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:20.160]   In this particular case, the obvious question
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:24.320]   that needs an honest answer is why did the Secret Service
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:27.220]   fail so terribly in protecting the former president?
[02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:31.400]   The story we're supposed to believe is that a 20-year-old,
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:35.140]   untrained loner was able to outsmart the Secret Service
[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:38.000]   by finding the optimal location on a roof
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.180]   for a shot on Trump from 130 yards away.
[02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:44.720]   Even though the Secret Service sniper spotted him
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:47.520]   on the roof 20 minutes before the shooting
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:48.880]   and did nothing about it.
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:53.020]   This looks really shady to everyone.
[02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:56.800]   Why does it take so long to get to a full accounting
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:58.400]   of the truth of what happened?
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:00.880]   And why is the reporting of the truth concealed
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:03.240]   by corporate government speak?
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:04.580]   Cut the bullshit.
[02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:05.800]   What happened?
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:07.760]   Who fucked up and why?
[02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:09.280]   That's what we need to know.
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:11.520]   That's the beginning of transparency.
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:13.720]   And yes, the director of the U.S. Secret Service
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:17.320]   should probably step down or be fired by the president.
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:19.240]   And not as part of some political circus
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:23.440]   that I'm sure is coming, but as a step towards uniting
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:25.780]   an increasingly divided and cynical nation.
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:31.760]   Conspiracy theories are not noise, even when they're false.
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:35.040]   They are a signal that some shady, corrupt,
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:37.040]   secret bullshit is being done
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:39.800]   by those trying to hold on to power.
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:42.200]   Not always, but often.
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:45.560]   Transparency is the answer here, not secrecy.
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:49.360]   If we don't do these things, we leave ourselves vulnerable
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:52.520]   to singular moments that turn the tides of history.
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:57.160]   Empires do fall, civil wars do break out
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.760]   and tear apart the fabric of societies.
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:02.800]   This is a great nation.
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:05.420]   The most successful collective human experiment
[02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:07.560]   in the history of earth.
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:10.120]   And letting ourselves become extremely divided
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:12.540]   risks destroying all of that.
[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:15.960]   So please ignore the political pundits,
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:18.520]   the political grifters, clickbait media,
[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:22.640]   outrage-fueling politicians on the right and the left
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:24.340]   who try to divide us.
[02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:26.320]   We're not so divided.
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:27.480]   We're in this together.
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:31.540]   As I've said many times before, I love you all.
[02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:35.040]   This is a long comment.
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:37.920]   I'm hoping not to do comments this long in the future
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:39.680]   and hoping to do many more.
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:42.500]   So I'll leave it here for today.
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:44.600]   But I'll try to answer questions
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:46.840]   and make comments on every episode.
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:49.640]   If you would like to submit questions, like I mentioned,
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:54.640]   including audio and video form, go to lexfriedman.com/ama.
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:57.480]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:45:59.700]   from Ralph Waldo Emerson.
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:03.360]   Adopt the pace of nature.
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:06.100]   Her secret is patience.
[02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:10.580]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:15.580]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
