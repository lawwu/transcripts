[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.480]   This week we focus on God's providence.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.280]   Yes, God is in control.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   He's orchestrating all things.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.040]   Your life, my life, this world, everything.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160]   And he's doing it even when it doesn't feel like it.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160]   Like in 2020.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   Well, he is.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.160]   He's at work.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160]   And making this case is Pastor John's next book release, simply titled "Providence,"
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.200]   a 750-page book releasing in less than two months on January 12th.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.400]   Monday, you may remember, I asked Pastor John about the book on Wednesday, last time we
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.920]   heard the introduction to the book.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.760]   And today we hear the conclusion to the book.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.000]   With the demands on his time, it's really doubtful that he'll read any more of it.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.400]   But we're grateful that he spent the time to record the intro and conclusion.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.640]   For us, we mention the book this week because you can now pre-order the title from our friends
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.720]   at Westminster Books for just $19.99.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.120]   We're thankful for their partnership and encourage you to order through them as you consider
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.240]   supporting faithful, independent Christian booksellers.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.040]   That's WTSBooks.com.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.760]   Last time we heard the 32-minute introduction.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   Today the conclusion.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   55 minutes long.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.720]   Combined, it's an hour and a half of audiobook readings that serve as our podcast content
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.760]   for this week and all of next week as well.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.360]   I hope you take time to listen to all of it as we take a brief break for Thanksgiving.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.360]   We return with new episodes on Monday, November 30th, and with new features to unveil in the
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   podcast in December.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.200]   I can't wait to share those with you soon enough.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.840]   Until then, here now is John Piper reading the conclusion to his forthcoming book, Providence,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.040]   coming out on January 12th.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040]   Conclusion.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.120]   Seeing and savoring the providence of God.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.680]   The providence of God, his purposeful sovereignty, is all-embracing, all-pervasive, and invincible.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.280]   Therefore, God will be completely successful in the achievement of his ultimate goal for
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.560]   the universe.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   God's providence is guided by the counsel of his will.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.320]   This counsel is eternal, all-knowing, and infinitely wise.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.880]   Its plans and goals, therefore, are perfect and cannot be improved.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.200]   They never change.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.880]   Providence is the purposeful sovereignty that carries those plans into action, guides all
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.920]   things toward God's ultimate goal, and leads to the final consummation.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.720]   Job's prayer is true.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.440]   You can do all things, and no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.400]   Or as God himself states it positively, "My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.600]   all my purpose."
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.520]   The extent of providence.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:05.160]   God's eternal plan includes everything, from the most insignificant bird fall, to the movement
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.800]   of stars, to the murder of his son.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.320]   It includes the moral acts of every soul, its preferences, choices, and deeds.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:27.160]   Neither Satan at his hellish worst, nor human beings at their redeemed best, ever act in
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.840]   a way that causes a revision in God's all-wise plan.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   Whether God planned to permit something or planned to be more directly involved, nothing
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.480]   comes to pass but what God planned as part of the process of pursuing his ultimate goal.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.120]   Therefore, the extent of his providence is total.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.240]   Nothing is independent of it.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:03.320]   Nothing happens but by the counsel of his will, the infinite wisdom of his plan.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.280]   Nature of Providence The nature of this providence is such that
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.900]   the preferences and choices of Satan and man are really their own preferences and their
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.620]   own choices.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.920]   They are blameworthy or praiseworthy owing to the way they relate to God in faith and
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.920]   to man in justice and love.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:37.280]   God's providence is decisive in what Satan and man decide and do, but it is not coercive.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.520]   That is, its ordinary way of working is to see to it that Satan and man decide and act
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.380]   in a way that is their own preference while fulfilling God's plan at every moment.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.000]   How God does this may remain a mystery while we see in a mirror dimly, but that he does
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.240]   it is what the Bible teaches.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.300]   It is the glory of God to conceal things.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.120]   The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.680]   us.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.840]   Ultimate Goal of Providence One essential aspect of the ultimate goal
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.640]   of this all-embracing, all-pervasive, invincible providence is the beautification of the Bride
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.160]   of Christ, the Church, the people of God, the elect.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.000]   This is why the final twelve chapters of this book have focused on the creation, transformation,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.560]   and glorification of the Bride.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.740]   But defining the ultimate goal of providence requires more than pointing to the beautification
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.460]   of the Bride of Christ.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.080]   Too much glory is left unexpressed.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.800]   What is this beautification?
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.880]   It is her sanctification, her holiness.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.140]   That is, it is her joyfully obeying all the Word of God.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.500]   It is, most essentially, her love for God, which overflows in God-glorifying love for
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   people.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.180]   It is her delight in God and her reflection of God.
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.900]   Therefore, to express it more fully, the ultimate goal of God's providence is to glorify His
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.220]   grace in the spiritual and moral beauty of Christ's undeserving, blood-bought Bride
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:43.700]   as she enjoys, reflects, and thus magnifies His greatness and beauty and worth above everything.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.540]   But even that expression of God's ultimate goal needs one more expansion in order to
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.260]   have its biblical proportions.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.820]   We must echo here the climax of Part 2.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:04.480]   To be sure, the ever-increasing joy of the Bride in the inexhaustible riches of the glory
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.700]   of Christ's grace will be the essence of how God is glorified in the coming ages.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.020]   But its essence is not its totality.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:23.540]   The Bride will inhabit a new creation, and in that new creation she will see dimensions
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.900]   of the glory of God as never before.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.380]   The heavens will be glad.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.200]   The sun and moon and stars will praise the Lord.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.740]   The earth will rejoice.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.740]   The sea will roar with praise.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.580]   The rivers will clap their hands.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.740]   The hills will sing for joy.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.840]   The field will exult and everything in it.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.700]   The trees of the forest will chant their praise.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.500]   The desert will blossom like the crocus.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:58.620]   The created world, liberated and perfected, will never cease to declare the glory of God.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.200]   That will be our dwelling.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.580]   But the dwelling is not the family.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.660]   The beauty of the new world is not the Bridegroom.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.980]   The perfected theater of creation will be glorious, radiant with God.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:23.740]   But the drama, the human experience of God in Christ, not the theater, will be foremost
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.940]   in magnifying the God of all-embracing, all-pervasive providence.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:37.340]   And the unparalleled beauty and worth of the reigning Lamb who was slain will be the main
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.700]   song of eternity.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:47.520]   And the joy of the children of God, the Bride of Christ, will be the main echo of the infinite
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:55.780]   excellencies of God and the focus of his eternal delight.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:04.500]   Ten effects of seeing and savoring this providence.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.140]   God did not reveal these glories for nothing.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:17.100]   He meant them to be known and loved, or as I like to say, seen and savored.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:25.380]   He intends that this seeing and savoring would result in showing, showing the greatness and
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.620]   the beauty and worth of God in his providence.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:37.460]   So before I bid farewell, I offer ten examples of the effects that knowing and loving this
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.520]   providence will have.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:48.220]   I say this providence, meaning the providence we have seen in the 45 chapters of this book,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:10:00.940]   this providence, the all-embracing, all-pervasive, invincible, purposeful sovereignty of God.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:11.980]   One, seeing and savoring this providence awakens awe and leads us into the depth of true God-centered,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:18.060]   Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated worship.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.980]   I stand back from the breathtaking panorama of God's glory in the Bible and lift my hands
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:35.100]   in silence, groping for words that do not feel pitiful before this majesty.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.700]   He is great beyond our comprehension.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.620]   Not that our praises ring loudest as we focus on what we do not know.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.200]   No.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:54.500]   God has shown us more of himself and more of his ways than we will ever exhaust in this
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.500]   world.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:02.360]   I have filled a book by simply tracing his counterintuitive wonders.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.760]   He has not been sparing in the revelation of his splendors.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.800]   Before we sing of what we cannot comprehend, let us spend a lifetime singing of what he
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.360]   has revealed.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:25.840]   Those who see and savor this providence sing, not because of ritualistic expectations, but
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:32.080]   because it's the nature of the God-besotted soul to sing.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:40.240]   And how can we not be God-besotted when every day we are immersed in an ocean of God-given,
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   God-governed, God-revealing wonders?
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.080]   Did not Hannah sing over this providence?
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.440]   The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble bind on strength.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.000]   The Lord kills and brings to life.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.800]   He brings down to shield and raises up.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.240]   The Lord makes poor and makes rich.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.920]   He brings low and exalts.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.040]   Poor Samuel 2, 4, and 6 through 7.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.480]   Did not Miriam sing over this providence?
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.720]   Sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously, the horse and the rider he has thrown into
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.960]   the sea.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.080]   Exodus 15, 21.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.360]   Did not Moses sing over this providence?
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.440]   I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.960]   Pharaoh's chariots and his host he cast into the sea.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.040]   In the greatness of your majesty, you overthrow your adversaries.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.760]   You send out your fury.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.680]   It consumes them like stubble.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:56.040]   Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.340]   Exodus 15, 1, 4, 7, 11.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.720]   Did not the psalmists sing over this providence?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.500]   The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.000]   He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.120]   The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.200]   Psalm 33, 10 through 11.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.960]   Come, behold the works of the Lord, how he has brought desolations on the earth.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.820]   He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.600]   He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.120]   He burns the chariots with fire.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.800]   Psalm 46, 8 through 9.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:45.760]   Whatever the Lord pleases, he does in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.280]   Psalm 135, 6.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.040]   Did not Mary sing over this providence?
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.400]   He has shown strength with his arm.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.160]   He has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:05.040]   He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.840]   Luke 1, 51 to 52.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.040]   And did not Paul sing over this providence?
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.520]   Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.040]   How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.120]   For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor or who has given
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.400]   a gift to him that he might be repaid?
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.600]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.040]   To him be glory forever.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.120]   Amen.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.560]   Romans 11, 33 through 36.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:53.920]   If there are believers or churches whose worship feels thin and passive and routine, could
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:03.400]   it be that they do not know this providence, this God?
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:12.720]   Two, seeing and savoring this providence makes us marvel at our own salvation and humbles
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.200]   us because of our sin.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:25.280]   God chose us from eternity when he saw that we deserved nothing but condemnation.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:33.080]   He predestined us to be his children and share the likeness of his son in spite of our unworthiness
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.040]   and treason.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.520]   He purchased us at the cost of his son's life.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:44.000]   He called us the way Lazarus was called, out of death.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.880]   He caused us to be born again.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.720]   He gave us the gift of repentance and faith.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.440]   He justified us.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.120]   He gave us his Holy Spirit as a guarantee.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.360]   He is working in us what is pleasing in his sight.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.720]   He will keep us from falling and bring us to glory.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:10.680]   He took away the sting of death and will bring us through it into the presence of Christ.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.920]   He will perfect our souls, raise us from the dead, give us new bodies like his glorious
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   body and present us with a new world for our eternal habitation where his glory is the
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.800]   light and the lamb is the lamp.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:36.680]   It is a great tragedy that millions of Christians do not know that this is true about them.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:44.540]   They have been taught a salvation with themselves as the decisive cause at the point of conversion.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:51.280]   This view of their own decisive power obscures the glory of what God has actually done for
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.200]   them, strips them of stunned thankfulness for the gift of faith, dulls the intensity
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.840]   of their amazement that they were raised from the dead, and takes away the wonder that their
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:12.680]   perseverance is owing to the omnipotent moment-by-moment keeping of God.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:20.860]   But if we see and savor this providence, oh, how we will exult in the freedom and fullness
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.920]   and sovereign effectiveness of our salvation.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:31.140]   We will be glad that it is all from God and through God and to God.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.920]   We will be made humble and happy and hopeful.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.940]   We will give all the glory to God.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:44.500]   The lowliness we feel because of our unworthiness will be accompanied and tempered by the wonder
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:49.080]   of God's merciful and infinitely loving providence.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.960]   We saw Jonathan Edwards' beautiful expression of the saints' humility in chapter 10.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:03.640]   I love this quote so much and long for this experience so earnestly that I give the last
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.960]   sentence again.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:13.760]   The desires of the saints, however earnest, are humble desires.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:22.360]   Their hope is a humble hope, and their joy, even when it is unspeakable and full of glory,
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:30.880]   is humble, brokenhearted joy and leaves the Christian more poor in spirit and more like
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:39.560]   a little child and more disposed to a universal lowliness of behavior.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:48.600]   Three, seeing and savoring this providence causes us to see everything as part of God's
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:19:02.000]   design, everything as from him and through him and to him for his glory.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.120]   When we hear God say that he works all things according to the counsel of his will, and
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:17.220]   then we see him doing this very thing countless times in his word and in his world, we are
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:23.000]   given a worldview with stunning implications.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.920]   Everything, absolutely everything relates to God.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:37.960]   As R.C. Sproul would often say, "There are no maverick molecules, nor are there any maverick
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:44.280]   athletes or actors or singers or presidents or scholars or street people.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.680]   All are in the sway of God's pervasive providence.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   All things and all persons fit into God's all-embracing plan."
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.400]   That is where ultimate meaning is found.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:06.040]   If we are going to understand anything at the most important level, we start with this
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.120]   reality.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:16.740]   God created the world, holds it in existence, and governs all of it for his purposes.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.400]   Everything relates to everything because everything relates to God.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.000]   The knowledge of this and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.640]   Where this is denied, all knowledge is enveloped in a cloud of folly.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:42.800]   Where it is affirmed, the possibilities of profound, amazing, beautiful, helpful insights
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.480]   abound.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:55.040]   Four, seeing and savoring this providence helps protect us from the trivializing effects
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:02.520]   of culture and from trifling with divine things.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:11.040]   One of the curses of our culture, and it has permeated the church and most Christian communication,
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:25.000]   is banality, triviality, silliness, superficiality, and an eerie addiction to flippancy and levity.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.360]   This is accompanied by what to me seems like a baffling, allergic reaction to seriousness,
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   dignity, and articulate precision in public speech.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:44.440]   Carelessness in speech and casualness in demeanor turn up in times and places where you would
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:51.240]   expect carefulness, clarity, earnestness, and even gravity.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:59.680]   My impression is that at the root of this culture of inarticulate, casual trifling is
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:07.000]   a loss of the weight of the greatness and awfulness of God.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.600]   Everything is light and funny because God is a lightweight.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.460]   The boats of our communication bounce around with a chipper bearing on the waves of cultural
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:26.000]   trifling because the heavy ballast of a big and holy God has been offloaded at the docks
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.820]   of man-centered theology and endless screen time.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:37.680]   This is a tragedy not only because it is the fruit of trivializing God, but also because
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:44.520]   it hinders us from seeing him and experiencing him as he really is in the majesty of his
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.240]   providence.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.840]   My guess is that some who read these lines will have no categories for viewing what I
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:59.680]   am saying any other way than as a summons to somberness and boredom.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:10.920]   We live in a culture that can scarcely imagine something like glad gravity or joyful sorrow.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:19.760]   Humor has been so identified with the silliness and levity of slapstick verbal antics that
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:31.040]   the robust, reality-rooted, natural explosiveness of humor is for many inconceivable.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:38.680]   Charles Spurgeon was a very funny man, but he was not a man of levity.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:47.340]   He did not trifle with sacred things or think that worship was a place for casual clowning.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:53.440]   He was not allergic to seriousness or dignity.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:59.680]   Three years after his death, Robertson Nicole expressed my concerns and used Spurgeon as
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   a counter-example.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:10.140]   Some of the humorous type may attract multitudes, but it lays the soul in ashes and destroys
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.400]   the very germs of religion.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:19.040]   Mr. Spurgeon is often thought by those who do not know his sermons to have been a humorous
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.440]   preacher.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:28.720]   As a matter of fact, there was no preacher whose tone was more uniformly earnest, reverent,
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.560]   and solemn.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:39.320]   Of course, every mature and healthy person knows that unbroken seriousness of a melodramatic
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:45.680]   or somber kind will inevitably communicate a sickness of soul.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.800]   But that is not our danger in the first half of the 21st century.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:58.180]   My point here is that seeing and savoring the all-embracing, all-pervasive providence
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:07.240]   of God has a wonderful effect in helping us recover the gift of authentic earnestness
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:14.360]   and the beautiful interweaving of gladness and gravity.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:23.200]   Five, seeing and savoring this providence helps us be patient and faithful amid the
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.180]   most inexplicable circumstances of life.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:35.860]   When our minds are saturated with Scripture and day after day we are exposed to God's
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:42.720]   inscrutable ways in the Bible, we become accustomed to trust him in the dark.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:50.020]   It is one thing to be told by God, "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.240]   my ways," declares the Lord.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:00.320]   But it is even more sobering and peace-giving to immerse ourselves in his providence and
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:07.680]   watch him time and again do and say things that are strange and contrary to our ordinary
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.720]   ways of thinking and acting.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.780]   In this way, the reality of providence shapes our minds and affections.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:24.180]   We become less vulnerable to panic and perplexity and dread, not because there are no perplexing
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:30.560]   and fearful circumstances, but because we have seen this before in God's Word.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:36.660]   God has shown us again and again that things are not what they seem and that he is always
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:43.240]   weaving something wise and good out of the painful, perplexing threads that look like
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.500]   a tangle in our lives.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:53.900]   A story may help us grasp how seeing and savoring God's providence helps deal with the perplexities
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.900]   of life.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:01.660]   I created this story based very loosely on a tale from T.H.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.500]   White's The Once and Future King.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:13.020]   Once upon a time, there was a very wise old man named Job.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:22.820]   In his old age, God gave to him a daughter whom he named Jemima, which means "little
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.080]   dove."
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.860]   He loved his little girl, and she loved her daddy.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:36.260]   One day, Job decided to go on a journey and asked Jemima if she would like to go along.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.380]   "Oh, yes," Jemima said.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.420]   "I would love to go along."
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:46.460]   And so they started off on their journey and walked all day.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:52.220]   At sundown, they saw a little cottage and knocked on the door.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.260]   A very poor man and his wife and baby lived there.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.720]   Job asked if he and Jemima could spend the night there before they continued on their
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.900]   journey in the morning.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.620]   The poor man and his wife were very happy to let them stay.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:15.380]   They gave Job and Jemima their own room and made them a simple supper.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.380]   This special treat was fresh milk from their only cow.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.880]   This was how the poor couple made a living.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:29.460]   Their cow gave good milk, which they sold for enough to live on.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:36.160]   In the morning, when Job and Jemima got up, they heard crying.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.900]   The cow had died during the night.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.700]   The poor man's wife was weeping.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.580]   "What will we do?
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.540]   What will we do?" she sobbed.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:54.900]   The poor man was about to cut the cow into pieces and sell the meat before it spoiled.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:02.860]   But Job said, "I think you should not cut the cow in pieces, but bury him by your back
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.580]   wall under the olive tree.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.260]   The meat may not be good to sell.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.620]   Trust God and he will take care of you."
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.940]   So the poor man did as Job suggested.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.600]   Then Job and Jemima went on their way.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:26.540]   They walked all day again and were very tired when they came to the next town and noticed
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.360]   a fine home.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.980]   They knocked on the door.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:36.660]   A very wealthy man lived in this house, and they hoped that they would not be an inconvenience
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.860]   to one so wealthy.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.760]   But the man was very gruff with them and said they could stay in the barn.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:51.980]   He gave them water and bread for supper and let them eat it by themselves in the barn.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:57.100]   Job was very thankful and said to the wealthy man, "Thank you very much for the bread
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.380]   and water and for letting us stay in your barn."
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:05.940]   In the morning, Job noticed that one of the walls of the house was crumbling.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.380]   So he went and bought bricks and mortar and repaired the hole in the wall for the wealthy
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.580]   man.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.340]   Then Job and Jemima went on their way and came to their destination.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:22.340]   As they sat by the fire that night, Jemima said, "Daddy, I don't understand the ways
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.340]   of God.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:30.580]   It doesn't seem right that the poor man's cow should die when he was so good to us and
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.900]   that you should fix the rich man's wall when he was so bad to us."
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:43.460]   "Well, Jemima," Job said, "many things are not the way they seem.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:50.380]   Perhaps this once I will tell you why, but after this you will have to trust God, who
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:54.620]   does not usually explain what He is doing."
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.980]   The poor man's cow was very sick, but he didn't know it.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.500]   I could taste it in the milk that he gave us for supper.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:09.300]   Soon he would have sold bad milk, and the people would have gotten sick and died, and
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.620]   they would have stoned him.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:17.780]   So I told him not to sell the meat, but to bury the cow under the olive tree by his back
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:24.100]   wall, because the Lord showed me that if he dug the grave there, he would find a silver
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:31.620]   cup buried from long ago and sell it for enough money to buy two good cows, and in the end,
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.540]   things would be better for him and his wife and child.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:42.140]   When we spent the night at the rich man's house, I saw the hole in the wall, and I saw
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.900]   more than that.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:50.300]   I saw that hidden in the wall from generations ago was a chest full of gold.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:55.140]   If the rich man had repaired the wall himself, he would have found it and continued in his
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.260]   pride and cruelty.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:04.860]   So I bought brick and mortar and closed the wall so that the man would never find this
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   treasure.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.580]   "Do you see, Jemima?"
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.180]   "Yes, Daddy, I see."
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:16.220]   6.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.060]   Seeing and savoring this providence shows us that the problem of God's sovereignty
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:27.620]   in suffering is more than relieved by the sustaining purpose and power of his sovereignty
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.260]   through suffering.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:38.700]   I mean this as a theological truth in the ultimate sense and as a precious experiential
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.380]   reality for those who trust Christ.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:48.500]   Many people stumble over the conclusion of this book because the all-pervasive providence
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:55.780]   of God means that his purposeful sovereignty holds sway over all suffering.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.380]   Satan's power to deceive and destroy is real.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.180]   Human sin against fellow humans is real.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.200]   Natural disasters are real.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:14.780]   But what we have seen in this book is that neither Satan, nor man, nor nature ever does
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:20.000]   anything that was not in the plan of God.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:28.620]   In the entire sequence of events in the world, God decides finally which causes will be effective.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.940]   Therefore all suffering is in the sway of God's providence.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.460]   He could always stop it.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:44.980]   When he doesn't, his permissions are planned and purposeful and, in his overall design,
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.500]   wise.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:52.700]   This wise, purposeful sovereignty will be the final answer to the justice and goodness
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.100]   of God's painful dealings in this world.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:01.880]   As we saw in chapter 22, all his ways are justice.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.580]   He loves righteous deeds.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:10.020]   Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:14.180]   He will judge the world with righteousness.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.960]   His righteousness endures forever.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:25.040]   No one will ever be able to rightly accuse God of treating him worse than he deserves.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:31.840]   Sin is universal in the heart of man and its denigration of God is an outrage beyond all
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.400]   its painful consequences.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.500]   Why have things come to this?
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:47.920]   The closest the Bible comes to giving an ultimate answer is Romans 9, 22, and 23.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:54.440]   If God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:00.380]   patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction in order to make known the riches
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:08.040]   of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory, how should
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.320]   this sentence be completed?
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:17.600]   I argued in chapter 7 that Paul's intention was that we complete it with something like
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:24.240]   this, "Then no legitimate objection can be raised."
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:31.520]   The reason no legitimate objection can be raised is that it is right and fitting that
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:40.440]   the fullness of the glories of God be manifest, including, as verse 22 says, wrath and power.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:47.480]   Therefore a world exists in which God's holy wrath and righteous judgment fall on
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.180]   guilty sinners.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.340]   If anyone in this world for whom the painful wrath of God is not fitting is swept away
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:02.280]   in the judgments, God will restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish them in the age
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.500]   to come.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   For those who trust Christ, God's sovereignty in suffering is not an unyielding problem
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.260]   but an unfailing hope.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:22.560]   It means that in the suffering of Christians, neither Satan, nor man, nor nature, nor chance
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.040]   is wielding decisive control.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:32.220]   God is sovereign over this suffering, which means it is not meaningless.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.320]   It is not wrath.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.420]   It is not ultimately destructive.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.760]   It is not wanton or heedless.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.560]   It is purposeful.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.340]   It is measured, wise, and loving.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:55.220]   Even if, as I have seen personally, the suffering is terrible in the last hour of death, when
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:02.380]   there is no life left in which the sufferer can be sanctified by it, even then it is eternally
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.640]   purposeful.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:11.680]   For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.540]   comparison as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:24.540]   For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.540]   If I may bear witness from fifty years of ministering the Word of God to many suffering
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.780]   people, here is what I would say.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:41.060]   For every one person whom I have heard or seen forsaking the truth of God's all-pervasive
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:47.540]   providence because of suffering, or more often because of the suffering and death of a loved
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:55.940]   one, I have seen ten others bear witness that the biblical truth of God's absolute sovereignty
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:04.380]   in and over their suffering and loss saved their faith, and some have said their sanity.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:10.340]   Indeed, it saved not only their faith in God and sanity of mind, but also their love for
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.340]   people.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.900]   How is that?
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:20.460]   Love cannot flourish where fear and greed consumes the heart with self-protecting or
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.020]   self-enhancing passions.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:30.500]   The heart must be set free from self-focus for the sake of focusing on others.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:37.780]   Something must break this double power, fearing loss and craving gain.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:46.900]   What breaks this power is the unshakable certainty of hope warranted by the unstoppable, blood-bought
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.840]   omnipotence of merciful providence.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:39:00.640]   We saw how this works in chapter 43, killing sin and creating love, by faith.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:10.200]   If our suffering turns us in on ourselves, we will not love well in the midst of affliction.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.800]   But that is precisely where Christian love should shine.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.920]   In a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy overflowed in a wealth of generosity.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:31.280]   Joy overflowing with generosity in affliction, that is the beauty of Christian love.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.360]   And how can there be such triumphant joy in affliction?
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.920]   Hope, certain hope.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:46.280]   We heard of the love that you had for all the saints because of the hope laid up for
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.440]   you in heaven.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.080]   What are you when others persecute you?
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:57.040]   Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:02.320]   Jesus, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:11.520]   In every case, hope, the confidence of a joyful future, broke the power of fear and greed
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.760]   and freed the heart for love.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:21.460]   This is how the Christian soul in suffering is saved from bitterness and revenge and self-indulgence
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.620]   and self-pity.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:35.480]   God promises to turn every sorrow to joy, every loss to gain, every groan to glory.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.680]   And this promise does not hang in the air.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:48.600]   It is rooted, warranted, secured, and guaranteed by the power that enables Christ even to subject
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.160]   all things to himself.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:57.760]   In other words, for thousands of suffering Christians, the all-pervasive providence of
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:09.800]   God is not a barrier for faith, but the ground of faith-preserving, sanity-sustaining, love-empowering
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   hope.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:21.660]   The all-embracing, all-pervasive, invincible providence of God found in the Bible is theologically
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:32.520]   more comprehensive and experientially more comforting and more fruitful than its denial.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.080]   7.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:43.560]   Seeing and savoring this providence makes us alert and resistant to man-centered substitutes
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.360]   that pose as good news.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:56.280]   Indeed, I would say that seeing and savoring this providence sends the roots of our counter-cultural
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:04.040]   conviction so deeply into the rock of Scripture that lovers of this truth are not easily blown
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.180]   over by the winds of false teaching.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:14.160]   Why this is true may be owing mainly to the fact that this providence is so contrary to
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:21.760]   fallen human nature and so out of step with self-exalting culture that if Christians break
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:31.640]   ranks with the world on this point, they can on any point, which means they are safe from
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.120]   much deception.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:41.800]   But I think the reason goes deeper than that for why embracing this providence makes us
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.000]   resistant to man-centered substitutes.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:56.240]   I think the sheer enormity of God, the sheer weight and seriousness and authority of God
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:07.280]   creates in the soul a spiritual sense, a kind of holy acumen that can detect in any idea
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:17.760]   or doctrine or behavior a tendency toward exalting man while diminishing God.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:25.880]   Eight, seeing and savoring this providence makes us confident that God has the right
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:35.480]   and the power to answer prayer that people's hearts and minds would be changed.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.920]   Prayer is one of the great wonders that God has given to the world.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:50.240]   That God would plan for his own sovereign hand to be moved by the prayers of his creatures
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   is amazing.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:59.120]   It is a thoughtless objection to say, "There's no point in praying since God has all things
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.240]   planned anyway."
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:08.920]   It's thoughtless because just a little thought would reveal that God has planned millions
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:15.160]   of human acts every day that cause other acts to happen.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:20.840]   A nail sinks into a board because God planned for a hammer to hit it.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:27.400]   A student makes an A on a test because God planned for the student to study.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:34.160]   A jet flies from New York to Los Angeles because God planned for fuel to be available, wings
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   to stay put, engines to thrust, and a pilot to know what he's doing.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:47.040]   In none of these cases do we say that the cause was pointless—the hammer, the studying,
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.440]   the fuel, the wing, the engine, the pilot.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.640]   Neither is prayer pointless.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.160]   It is part of the plan.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:03.800]   In fact, the all-embracing, all-pervasive, unstoppable providence of God is the only
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:09.480]   hope for making our most heartfelt prayers effective.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.600]   What is your greatest longing?
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.080]   Your most heartfelt prayer?
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.160]   Probably it is for the salvation of someone you love.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:27.280]   Or it may be for the liberation of your soul from some sinful bondage.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:36.360]   When you pray that God would save your loved one or liberate you from bondage to sin, what
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.120]   are you asking God to do?
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:48.080]   You are asking him to do what he promised to do in the new covenant, which Jesus bought
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.680]   with his blood, which is why we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:59.840]   So we pray, God, take out of their flesh the heart of stone and give them a new heart of
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.320]   flesh.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.560]   Lord, circumcise their hearts so that they love you.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   Father, put your Spirit within them and cause them to walk in your statutes.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:19.920]   Lord, grant them repentance and the knowledge of the truth that they may escape from the
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.760]   snare of the devil.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:28.160]   Father, open their hearts so that they may believe the gospel.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:35.520]   The only people who can pray like that are people who believe that saving faith is a
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.320]   gift of providence.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:45.280]   Many people do not believe this because they believe that human beings have the power of
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.780]   ultimate self-determination at the point of conversion.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:56.560]   In other words, God can woo sinners, but he cannot create their faith.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.080]   Man must have the final say.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:08.360]   At the point when faith comes into existence, man, not God, is decisive.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:16.720]   My point here is that people who really believe this cannot consistently pray that God would
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.400]   convert unbelieving sinners.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.820]   Why?
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:27.960]   Because if they pray for divine influences in the sinner's life, they are either praying
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:34.200]   for successful influence, which takes away the sinner's ultimate self-determination,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:40.920]   or they are praying for unsuccessful influence, which is not praying for conversion.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:48.360]   So either they must give up praying that God would convert people or give up ultimate human
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:56.240]   self-determination or go on acting inconsistently.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.200]   Prayer is a spectacular gift.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:07.920]   No one believed more firmly than Paul that humans do not have the final say in their
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.240]   conversion but that God does.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:19.140]   It depends not on human will or exertion but on God who has mercy.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:27.180]   But probably no one prayed with more tears and more urgency than Paul for the conversion
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.260]   of sinners.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:34.740]   I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart for the sake of my brothers, my
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.800]   kinsmen according to the flesh.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:43.700]   My heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:52.640]   He prayed this way because he knew that the new birth is not a mere decision but a miracle.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:58.740]   With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:04.180]   The providence we have seen in this book does not make prayer a problem.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.860]   It makes prayer powerful.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:17.900]   9. Seeing and savoring this providence shows us that evangelism and missions are absolutely
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:24.900]   essential for people to be converted to Christ because God makes them the means of his work
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.700]   in creating saving faith.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:37.260]   Just as thoughtless as the previous objection about prayer is the objection that says there's
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:42.980]   no point in evangelism and missions since God has planned whom he will save.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:52.300]   A moment's thought will reveal that the plan to save people through the Word of God includes
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.580]   the plan to send preachers of the Word.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:01.080]   No one believes and is saved without hearing the gospel.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:06.920]   The new birth comes through the living and abiding Word, the gospel.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.520]   You have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.140]   and abiding Word of God.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.140]   And this Word is the good news that was preached to you.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.420]   This gospel is not written in the clouds.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:29.120]   It is entrusted to Christians who become witnesses and missionaries.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:36.300]   If there were no human witnesses, there would be no salvation.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.220]   Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:44.380]   How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed?
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.020]   And how are they to believe in him whom they have never heard?
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:51.660]   And how are they to hear without someone preaching?
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.300]   And how are they to preach unless they are sent?
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:02.780]   So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the Word of Christ.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:07.780]   Romans 10, 13 through 15 and 17.
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:15.140]   When Paul spoke of his own commissioning from the risen Christ, he described it in the most
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.500]   impossible terms.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:25.080]   Jesus commissioned him to the Gentiles to do what only God can do.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:32.660]   Jesus said to Paul, "I am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:37.880]   darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.560]   of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me."
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.920]   Acts 26, 17 to 18.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.360]   Open blind eyes?
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   Liberate from Satan?
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.600]   That's Paul's mission and ours.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:52:00.720]   This is how the blind see and the enslaved are set free—by evangelism and missions.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.060]   They are the instruments.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.920]   But the instruments are not the miracle of conversion.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.080]   They are another kind of miracle—the miracle of obedience.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:16.560]   But we are talking here about evangelism and the miracle of conversion.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:21.920]   When the Word is spoken, the Lord opens hearts.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.520]   That is what we read about Lydia.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:31.520]   The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.360]   The Word spoken by Paul is the essential instrument.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:43.000]   The work of the Lord is the miracle of the heart-opening conversion.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:50.560]   As in the case of prayer, the unthwartable providence of God is not a problem for evangelism
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.280]   and missions.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.120]   It is their only hope of success.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:02.520]   The obstacles to missions around the world today are insurmountable but for one thing—the
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.960]   providence of God is unstoppable.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.580]   It cannot be stopped by closed countries.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.200]   It cannot be stopped by hostile religions.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.920]   It cannot be stopped by difficult languages and cultures.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:22.000]   And it cannot be stopped by the ultimate self-determination of the fallen human soul because in the world
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.520]   of God's purposeful sovereignty such self-determination does not exist.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:36.880]   We may and we must build our lives and our mission on this confidence.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:44.800]   I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   And to that end, this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:55.000]   as a testimony to all the nations and then the end will come.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:03.520]   I pray that God will use this book to catapult thousands of new missionaries into God's
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:09.360]   harvest with undaunted confidence.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.520]   10.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:21.820]   Seeing and savoring this providence assures us that for all eternity God will be increasingly
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:31.760]   glorified in us as we are increasingly satisfied in him.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:40.720]   Running through this book like a golden thread is the truth that God designed the world and
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:49.680]   performs his providence so that his glory in saving us and our joy in seeing him would
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:57.160]   be forever united as each increases in the increase of the other.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:03.300]   When the immeasurable riches of God's glory in saving us through the slaying of the lamb
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:12.600]   are forever and continually dispensed from his infinite treasury, our gladness will increase
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.000]   with every fresh sight.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.400]   And as our gladness in God increases, his worth will be seen as a greater and greater
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:28.280]   treasure reflected in the pleasures of his people.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:36.700]   The all-embracing, all-pervasive, unstoppable providence of God is precious in proportion
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.640]   as we hope for this day to come.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.100]   And it will come.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:49.200]   God will forever be increasingly glorified in us as we are increasingly satisfied in
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.100]   him.
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.740]   In your presence there is fullness of joy.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:59.160]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.680]   Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.560]   Let your glory be over all the earth.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.240]   Our Lord, come.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:09.740]   Amen.
