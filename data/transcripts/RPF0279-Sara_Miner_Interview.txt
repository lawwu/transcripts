[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.800]   A lot of people have this dream as regards their financial independence. The dream is
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600]   this. I'm going to work hard, save money. I'm going to build up enough money to where
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560]   I'm financially independent. And then I'm going to take off and I'm going to travel
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.620]   the world. I'm going to spend time going to places in the world that I want to go and
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.340]   doing adventurous things. And that's cool. I support that. I've got to some degree that
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.380]   dream myself. But what if you just skipped all that hard work of saving up a bunch of
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.060]   money and becoming financially independent and you just got a job that paid you to travel
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:24.460]   the world? Today, we talk with a listener who's done exactly that.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.620]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.060]   Thank you for being with me today. Today, we talk with listener of the show, Sarah Minor,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.340]   who reached out to me and she basically said this, "Hey, Joshua, I like the show, but frankly,
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.780]   it's gotten a little boring lately. It's not very radical." Tell you what, to spice up
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.620]   the show, Joshua, I'll share my story with you if you like. It's pretty cool. And I said,
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:02:06.140]   "Hey, Joshua, I'm getting kind of bored. Where's the radical stuff?" And I'll say, "Well, what
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.660]   do you propose?" And you'll respond back with something and who knows, I may have you on.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.260]   No, I'm thrilled to have Sarah on for today's show. It's very cool, very exciting, and this
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.380]   is a cool story that she's going to share with you about how she and her husband have
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.660]   built a life of adventure that allows them to work, do work they care about, do well
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.820]   financially, save money, and yet still enjoy traveling the world and living in a lifestyle
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.020]   that they have decided is right for them. And I think it should be an inspirational
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.620]   story. I'm all about helping you speed up your results. I've searched personally, searched
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.820]   and searched for what is the theme of radical personal finance. I didn't know the theme
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.740]   when I started. And some themes have emerged, however, that I feel strongly about. And one
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.300]   of those themes is speeding up the results, skipping some of the unnecessary steps in
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.740]   order to get where you really want to go. And I think this is a great example of that.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.100]   I'm not saying skip hard work. Hard work is generally important. I'm not saying skip having
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.060]   a plan. I'm not saying that you can have instant gratification. But I am saying that you can
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.900]   design a much more efficient plan than what is often presented as the standard plan and
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.340]   the standard approach in our society around. So in today's show, we're going to do exactly
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.620]   that.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.780]   Before I play the interview, though, I want to hook up our sponsor. Sponsor of the day
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.340]   number one is Jay Fleischman from The Student Loan Show. Jay is an awesome guy. Twice he
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.420]   has been a guest on Radical Personal Finance. He hosts a podcast called The Student Loan
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.340]   Show and he is a bankruptcy and student loan attorney. What you need to know about Jay
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:49.100]   is this. Number one, if you have student loans, you need to call him. Go to studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.300]   Sign up for a free â€“ excuse me. Sign up for his basic level email consultation, 50
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.900]   bucks for him to do a review of your student loans. Situations, you're going to hear
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.420]   Sarah and me in today's show talk briefly about working for organizations like the Peace
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.540]   Corps, other federal organizations that will help in student loan forgiveness. That's
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.060]   the type of strategy Jay can talk to you about and in many situations can make a big difference.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.700]   But there are so many options with student loan shows. Jay is a real expert and you should
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.040]   talk to him. If I had student loans, the first thing I would do would be to have a consultation
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.580]   with Jay and make sure I'm paying them off in the most intelligent way.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.180]   Number two, if you are in any kind of confrontational situation with a creditor, especially a student
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.620]   loan creditor, reach out to Jay for advice. Number three, listen to his show. It's well
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.460]   worth it.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.380]   Advice of the day number two today is Paladin Registry. Paladin is my recommendation to
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.460]   you for where to start your search for a financial advisor. Finding a financial advisor can be
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.020]   tough. Finding a good financial advisor is even tougher. I can't promise that you're
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.820]   definitely going to be able to find that great financial advisor through Paladin Registry.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.620]   But I can promise that it's a better place to start than just randomly walking around
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.300]   and seeing what's nearby you. Paladin Registry is a financial advisor registry service where
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.340]   they go through and they carefully vet and research the advisors that join their organization.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.780]   The advisors pay to be listed in their organization. But it's the most ethical way that the founder,
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.740]   possibly Jack Wehmeyer, was actually able to come up with and I fully agree with him.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.740]   It's the best starting place that we have.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.660]   So if 2016 is the year that you've decided to get a handle on your finances, start by
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.260]   reaching out and interviewing some local financial advisors. Start your search at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/financialadvisor.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.660]   You'll find a link to their website, their website is at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/paladin.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.860]   That will forward you through to their webpage. You'll put in your contact information. You
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.180]   know how this thing works. You put in your name, your email address, your phone number,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.500]   your zip code, where you're located. You put in the amount of assets that you have that
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.020]   you'd like the financial advisor's input and advice on and kind of what you're looking
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.980]   for. Put that form in. That form will go into Paladin. They will take it. They will connect
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.820]   you with some advisors in your area who fit your criteria and they will pass those advisors'
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.320]   information on to you. You can expect to receive a couple of calls from those advisors.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.020]   Then from there, it's up to you. You can interview them. Start on the phone. They will invite
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.540]   you into their office for a meeting. Go in and meet with them and see if any of them
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.700]   click with you and then let me know about your feedback. So far, the feedback has been
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.940]   pretty good. I've been impressed. A couple of questions, people said, "Hey, I talked
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.900]   to a couple of people and they were good, but they just weren't right for me." Totally
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.180]   fine. That's what is expected. You got to find someone who's the right personality
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.180]   fit, but it's a great place to start. So go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.180]   And now it's time to play the interview with Sarah.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.180]   Sarah, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.060]   Sarah Riegel (00:01:30): Thanks for having me.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.500]   Tyler Reilly (00:01:31): I am so glad that you are on the show today.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.660]   You're a long-time listener and I love being able to profile stories like yours as we'll
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.100]   do through the course of this interview. And I'm excited because you wrote me a note and
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.820]   you said, "Joshua, the content has not been very radical lately. How about we get some
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.820]   more radical content on the show?" And I wrote you back and I said, "Put up or shut up. Let's
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.460]   hear your story and we're going to bring your story." So you've got a test today. Let's
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.340]   find out how radical you really are.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.300]   Sarah Riegel (00:02:05): I'll do my best.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.420]   Tyler Reilly (00:02:07): So you and your husband have built a really
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:23.580]   interesting lifestyle that has allowed you to live and adventure, but also do well financially.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.980]   And I'd love for you to share a little bit of that story. Let's start with where you're
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.380]   living now and how you wound up there.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.940]   Sarah Riegel (00:02:25): Sure. So my husband and I are living in Madagascar
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.540]   off the East Coast of Africa. And we've been here a very short time, actually. We moved
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.180]   here about four months ago. And prior to that, we lived in a country in West Africa called
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:53.380]   Burkina Faso for three years. And we got here. Well, do you want the long version or the
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.380]   short version?
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.860]   Tyler Reilly (00:02:49): Let's go with the medium long version.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.340]   Sarah Riegel (00:02:51): Okay. I met my husband in the Peace Corps.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:07.340]   We were Peace Corps volunteers in Benin in West Africa and always knew that we wanted
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:13.620]   to live overseas and pursue international careers. And so after the Peace Corps, we
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.020]   came back to the States and we lived on the East Coast for almost five years. I got my
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:25.980]   master's degree and he worked for Peace Corps, actually. And then after five years and once
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.540]   I finished my degree, we moved back to West Africa. He worked for Peace Corps for several
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.980]   years and eventually joined the Foreign Service.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.220]   Tyler Reilly (00:03:17): So are you at all working with the Peace
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.060]   Corps now? Who are you actually working with now?
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:45.300]   Sarah Riegel (00:03:23): I work for NGOs, international NGOs in the
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.900]   field of global health. And my husband works for State Department.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.620]   Tyler Reilly (00:03:29): How interesting. And the cool thing about
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.460]   this is you guys have been able to travel the world and be able to make money, right?
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.020]   Sarah Riegel (00:03:36): Yeah. Well, so far. Yes.
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.540]   Tyler Reilly (00:03:40): Was this originally the long-term plan? So
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.260]   you both were involved with the Peace Corps. Did you always just know that the expatriate
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.100]   lifestyle was something that was appropriate to you? Or did you just bumble into the opportunity?
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.580]   Sarah Riegel (00:03:56): I think it was much more kind of always in
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:25.980]   my future than it was for my husband. Since I was a kid, I traveled with my parents. I
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.580]   studied different foreign languages. I studied abroad in college. This was always something
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:37.780]   that I wanted to do. And I always wanted to be in a field of public service. So living
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.860]   overseas and working with NGOs was very much something that I knew from the time I was
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:48.380]   in college I wanted to do. My husband, on the other hand, maybe stumbled into it a little
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:57.020]   bit. And he joined Peace Corps on a bit of a whim and met me. And I guess, I suppose
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.460]   I would say I kind of turned his life upside down. I don't know that he would have chosen
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:11.380]   on his own to live in developing countries for the next 15 years, but here we are. So
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.380]   it's a little of both.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.540]   What is your lifestyle like?
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:23.940]   Sarah Riegel (00:04:33): Oh, that's a great question. So I think what's
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:35.460]   interesting that people probably don't realize is that our life is not that exotic. We still
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:44.540]   get up at six in the morning and shower, breakfast, go to work, work eight to 10 to 12 hour days
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.220]   and come home and dinner. It's really not that different the day to day from what we
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:57.380]   did in the States. But what's different is that we do it in very interesting places.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:03.060]   And we get to work with people from different cultures and different backgrounds who speak
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.060]   different languages and who kind of help us broaden our perspective.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:14.100]   There's probably something to do with the individual personality of different people
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.740]   where they either like it or they hate it. Some people dealing with foreign customs,
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.380]   foreign traditions, it's very difficult for them. For some people, it's easier. I like
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.540]   it because a lot of times it just allows me to simply take people as they are more and
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.980]   just say, "Oh, that's their culture." I get frustrated much more easily with my US American
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.780]   compatriots than I do when I'm traveling abroad at the weird customs.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.420]   Lauren Ruffin (00:05:17): Yeah, it's very funny. One of the examples
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.380]   that we always talk about is when we were Peace Corps volunteers and in general Peace
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.020]   Corps volunteers, many of them get put in very small villages, kind of in the middle
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:59.300]   of nowhere where people tend to have certain ideas. And as a Peace Corps volunteer, you
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.340]   spend a lot of time trying to integrate into that community and accept these ideas no matter
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:10.340]   how different they are from your own. You say, "I don't know best here because this
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.660]   isn't my community. And so I need to be very accepting of these things." Whereas in the
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:22.220]   United States, in very similar situations, I find myself being much more judgmental of
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.060]   ideas that I don't agree with. Even though the situation is really the same, I might
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.180]   not know where that person's from. I might not know their background. And I'm still not
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:38.740]   an expert, but I think I'm a lot more, and I think many people are a lot more laid back
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.860]   and accepting of differences like that when they're in foreign countries.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:49.660]   I'd like to cover some information on the actual market opportunity as far as Peace
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.940]   Corps and international NGO work, that type of thing. But before we do that, I want to
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:00.460]   actually just ask about some of the tactical boots on the ground aspects of your lifestyle.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:07.140]   You just moved to Madagascar. Did you guys have to figure out all of the logistics and
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.540]   figure out where you're going to live, how you're going to get there, all that stuff?
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.620]   Or did you just show up and move into the apartment that somebody had chosen for you?
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.060]   What are the actual logistics of this lifestyle like?
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:22.780]   Well, it varies a little bit from person to person, and I'll tell you about us and then
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.340]   kind of about how it works for some other folks. So we're very lucky in that my husband
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:34.500]   has worked with the United States Foreign Service, and the U.S. Embassy here has been
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:41.180]   absolutely fantastic in helping us get settled in. There is embassy housing, so an apartment
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:48.460]   was already identified. They helped us ship our things. It makes settling in much, much
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:56.060]   easier. You don't have to find your own apartment. You don't have to figure out how
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.540]   you're going to get your phone line installed. A lot of those little things are taken care
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:09.740]   of by my husband's employer, which is great. And there are some employers that do that,
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.540]   not just the U.S. government. But then there are also, for a lot of folks who work for
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:21.700]   NGOs, they have to handle all of that themselves. So they arrive, and they might live in a hotel
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.220]   for the first 30 to 60 days while they're looking for an apartment. They have to buy
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:34.140]   a car. They have to buy furniture to set up their house. So it varies quite a bit.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.780]   What is the U.S. Foreign Service?
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:46.540]   It is the ambassadors of the United States government to the rest of the world. So my
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:52.140]   husband, he's not a diplomat. He works in management and administration at the U.S.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.300]   Embassy here.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:02.980]   And if someone is interested in getting started in that world, what's the best, in the world
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:09.740]   of an international expatriate lifestyle, what are some of the different paths that
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.180]   you guys have gone through or that other people have gone through and good ways to test it
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:19.180]   out, see if you like it, and then move into kind of, I guess, the cushier side of things?
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:25.020]   So I would say that there are, for people who are interested and willing to live in
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:32.620]   developing countries, there are two main paths, maybe three. And the first is, of course,
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:39.700]   NGO work and humanitarian work. And to start on that path, it helps to speak at least one
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:46.420]   foreign language. French, Spanish, Portuguese are very popular. Russian, if you want to
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:53.660]   go to the former Soviet Union. And also, you know, have studied NGO management or public
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:59.300]   health or economic development or something like that. But there are lots of entry level
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.380]   jobs in these fields in the United States. And you have to, you know, gain some amount
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.700]   of experience in order to end up overseas.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:18.020]   The second field is government. So there are lots of agencies of the United States government,
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:24.020]   if somebody's American, and many other nations also have diplomatic presence all over the
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:32.500]   world. In the United States, the best way to do that is to go to state.gov, the website
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.700]   of the State Department, and check out if you're interested in becoming a foreign service
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.700]   officer or a foreign service specialist, who are the folks who keep our embassies running
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:51.140]   and who handle diplomatic relations overseas. And then finally, you know, there are small,
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:58.260]   it depends very much on the country. I've lived in countries that are much less developed.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:04.020]   And so there's not a lot of international business. But in some countries, Nigeria,
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:11.300]   South Africa, throughout Asia, there are a lot of business people who work for international
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.820]   businesses who are interested in growing their presence in developing countries, especially
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:22.420]   the larger countries, you know, Indonesia and Asia, that sort of thing. So I would say
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:27.740]   those are the three kind of different strategies that you could look at for people who are
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.060]   interested in this line of work.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.180]   How's the money and how does it vary among those three strategies?
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:43.260]   Oh, that's a great question. So I would say the money for people who work in the nonprofit
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:51.460]   field is probably the least attractive of the three. But even among people who work
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:18:02.900]   for NGOs, the compensation for skilled positions overseas is, it's generous. I say that because
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:09.940]   a lot of the positions for our expatriate positions are designed to support a family
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.860]   on one income. And that's because in a lot of the countries, in developing countries
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:23.660]   around the world, it's very difficult for spouses to find employment. And so many of
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:30.100]   these types of jobs come with a competitive salary to what you'd be paid in the US. And
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:37.020]   then some sort of, you know, housing or housing stipend. In some cases, there are, you know,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.100]   extra allowances to attract qualified people, especially in countries that are difficult
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:52.700]   to live in. You know, for people who are pursuing a career in government, it's also, you know,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.620]   they make sure to cover your costs and to make sure you're earning something similar
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:03.300]   to what you would be in the United States. And the difficult part of the government positions
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:09.620]   is they move every two to three years, which is a hardship and is a hassle and very difficult.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:15.180]   And so those types of things are compensated.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.180]   But you and even though they are designed for one income, you and your husband have
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:27.060]   been able to, both of you be employed. How have you been able to arrange that?
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:34.940]   Yeah, so we were very strategic. When we decided that we wanted to come overseas, we had seen
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.580]   a lot of kind of dual career couples really struggle with the transition because it can
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:46.220]   be really difficult, small labor markets with expat positions for both spouses to find jobs.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:53.180]   So we decided that between the two of us, the less employable person should find work
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:58.500]   first and then the more employable person would find something in that country once
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.900]   we arrived. So in our case, my husband works in a much more specialized field than I do.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.380]   And there aren't a ton of opportunities overseas, whereas I work in global health.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:16.500]   That's my specialty. So he found the job first and then the countries that we've moved
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.380]   to once we arrive or once we know where we're going to be moving, I look for a job and I
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:28.060]   find them. But it's difficult. You know, there aren't a lot of couples who have the necessary
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:36.140]   skill sets to do that, with the exception of couples who have portable jobs. So if one
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:42.660]   spouse wants to work overseas and they're able to find a job and the other spouse is
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:49.380]   not geographically bound, then they could live anywhere in the world and have the benefits
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:56.020]   of that dual income while, you know, enjoying a low cost of living.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.980]   With regard to the cost, what countries have you lived in, you and your husband lived in,
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.380]   in this international career that you've been pursuing?
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:11.020]   We were Peace Corps volunteers in Benin in West Africa. My husband lived in Mali for
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:16.700]   a brief period for six months. We lived in Burkina Faso for almost three years, also
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.020]   in West Africa, and just moved to Madagascar not too long ago.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.460]   Okay, so all of those there in various parts of Africa. My question was going to be about
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:32.740]   cost of living. I generally, my personal experience, I've not traveled in Africa with the exception
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:38.420]   of Egypt, which I'm not sure if that counts because it's so different than lower Africa.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:45.020]   But when I've traveled, many of the countries that are developing economies do seem to have
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:51.460]   a lower cost of living. And yet, I got that theory completely blown up when I moved to
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.740]   Haiti â€“ excuse me, when I traveled in Haiti. And I found that traveling in Haiti was actually
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.300]   â€“ it was one of the most expensive places I'd ever traveled. And what I found was
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:07.200]   the reason it was because there wasn't a developed middle class economy that either
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.580]   I could travel around on the tap tap for, you know, a penny or two. But those conditions
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.780]   were â€“ at that time, I was with my wife on our honeymoon, so those conditions weren't
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.220]   acceptable for what we were trying to do. Or I could travel with the rich people. And
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.500]   I was traveling around in a black Mercedes G-Wagon with tinted windows, and it's costing
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   me $100 for a 20-minute ride to the bus station. And that lack of a middle class economy was
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:42.660]   the best theory I could come up with for why Haiti was a really expensive place to â€“ at
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:48.620]   least to travel for me. And it made me wonder if I didn't have some blind spots about
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.220]   traveling in other parts of the world. So, living in those countries in Africa, what
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.700]   have you found as far as the cost of living? Is it dramatically cheaper than the United
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:04.900]   States? Have you found it to be equivalent because you're in the upper society? What's
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.900]   been your personal experience?
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:15.860]   So, I think there are two parts. One part is in â€“ sometimes there's just not a lot
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:22.380]   to spend your money on. So, in some countries that kind of are smaller or sleepy â€“ the
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.980]   capital cities are sleepy towns. There's not a lot to do. There's not a lot to spend
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:33.420]   money on. So, maybe people might buy some souvenirs. They may, you know, go out to dinner
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:39.740]   a couple times a week. But you're outside of kind of the consumerist culture of the
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:45.260]   United States. And so, I do think that people tend to spend less when they're in those
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.860]   types of environments where they're not being driven to spend money on all sorts of
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.380]   things.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:57.580]   And then the second part is related to cost of living like you mentioned. I think if you
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:06.540]   expect to live an American lifestyle in developing countries, it can be very expensive. Especially,
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.380]   I mean, you know, Madagascar is an island. Everything either gets flown in or gets boated
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:18.700]   in. The last two countries we lived in were landlocked, which makes things extremely expensive.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:24.900]   Anything that's imported, you know, comes in on the train and has those huge transport
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:32.580]   costs built in. So, if you expect to buy, you know, French cheese or French wine or
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:41.380]   whatever it may be, that's extremely expensive. But if you are willing to accept substitutes
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:52.420]   or if you're not expecting to live an American lifestyle, it can be very inexpensive because
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:58.300]   you can go to the market and you can get, you know, four pounds of strawberries for,
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:05.420]   you know, a dollar when they're in season or mangoes or whatever it may be.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:11.660]   If you were going to compare cost of living and incomes for some friends of yours who
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.300]   are in similar situations, what would be the type of numbers that you would guess as far
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.700]   as how much they could earn in these types of job positions and how much their costs
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.660]   of living would be?
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:34.140]   So I would say that, you know, people that are in, you know, mid-level to senior positions
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:40.660]   would probably be earning in countries that I've lived in, which typically have kind
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:48.980]   of hardship allowances because it's very difficult to attract skilled people, might
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:26:00.420]   earn anywhere from, you know, $70,000 a year upwards. And the cost of living, usually housing
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:05.100]   would be covered by an employer or at least subsidized by an employer. So the cost of
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:12.860]   living would be at the very most, you know, 60% of what they would be spending in the
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.140]   States.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:20.420]   And it could probably be done with focus maybe even less. I mean, the concepts of frugality
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:25.020]   could be extended. And to me, this is one of the opportunities that I see. If for people
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:30.240]   who are pursuing financial independence, you don't necessarily have to plan on working
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.340]   in this kind of lifestyle for a 40-year career, but with some focus and preparation and perhaps
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:44.100]   five or 10 years of work in a career like this and diligent savings on the side, that
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.660]   can make a huge difference for your financial independence plan. And then if you wanted
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.060]   to continue traveling in various parts of the world, you could do that on your own investment
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:58.220]   income or if you wanted to move back to the States, you could potentially do that. And
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:06.460]   I see this as a really viable lifestyle for somebody to be able to build financial independence
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.860]   in a shorter period of time while still enjoying an out-of-the-norm adventure.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:19.740]   Exactly. Even people who aren't particularly disciplined about their finances, you'll frequently
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:25.020]   hear stories about folks who come back from a two- or three-year tour overseas, either
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:30.380]   in a danger post like Iraq or Afghanistan or Pakistan or a developing country, a hardship
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.620]   post, and they're able to put a down payment down on a house or they have finished paying
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:43.060]   off their student debt or their credit cards. So even for people who don't really concentrate
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.820]   on it, they're able to make real progress on their finances.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:54.300]   How in your experience does the tax situation work? So you guys are living out of the country,
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.380]   I would guess, for a majority of the year. What's been your experience with regard to
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.300]   your personal tax planning?
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:09.180]   So our situation is kind of a mixed bag since my husband works for the federal government
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.460]   and I work for NGOs. He's required to pay federal taxes. All federal employees are required
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:20.500]   to pay federal taxes, even if they don't live in the United States. And my income is subject
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:28.620]   to the foreign earned income exclusion. So my income up to, I think it's around $95,000,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.940]   is not subject to federal tax, which is very nice.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.980]   Are you then paying the local tax on that income?
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:44.220]   Yeah. So typically, this varies from country to country. In some countries, if you're not
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:50.940]   paying US tax and you're being paid locally, then you're required to pay whatever the local
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:57.580]   income tax is. In other places, if for example, you're being, you know, your bank account is
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:03.300]   in the United States, then the tax issues are more complicated. So it varies a great
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:08.460]   deal from country to country. Developing countries tend to have less sophisticated
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:15.380]   taxation systems. It's not like if you're living in Germany, then there's very clear
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.300]   guidelines on how these things work. It's a lot less clear and you really have to do
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:27.460]   your best to follow all of the local regulations when you're living in developing countries.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.420]   Do you, how big of a factor are expenses to get back and forth to the United States for
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.940]   vacation or furlough in your budget?
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:46.660]   It's probably our biggest single line item. A lot of employers will provide, you know,
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.660]   maybe one trip home a year or something like that, which makes a really big difference
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.780]   depending on where you're living. But even, you know, aside from that, you know, we've
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:03.780]   had some family events in the last four years, some deaths in the family, some weddings,
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.060]   that sort of thing. And so for a while, we were actually back in the States every six
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:15.660]   months and, you know, we were spending easily, you know, $10,000 on plane tickets every year
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.260]   just to get back and forth.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:23.420]   Wow. Yeah, definitely can add up and it's got to be factored in because it's not easy
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.700]   to live on the other side of the world from all those that you know. It's probably easier
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:33.980]   now than it once was with the fact that we can connect more easily. Here we are talking
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:38.940]   in real time on opposite sides of the world for a very low cost, but it's still not easy
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.300]   to be away.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:47.020]   Yeah. And I think it's, you know, it's one of those things that we kind of joke about
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:52.940]   as just being the tax that we pay, not an actual tax, but kind of a metaphorical tax
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:31:01.460]   for living overseas and having a low cost of living is that, you know, in return, we
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:06.260]   have a very large line item in our budget that is set aside for us to go home and spend
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.140]   time with our families.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.140]   Do you guys intend to do this long term?
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:21.540]   We do. Yeah, we we plan to, you know, for probably the next 15 or 20 years to to to
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:27.180]   be hopefully in Africa. This is where we're we're most at home, but really anywhere in
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.700]   the world.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:36.140]   I'd like to ask you a couple more questions about the Peace Corps. I seriously considered
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:42.300]   and looked at the Peace Corps when I was in college, and I just came to the perspective
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:47.460]   that I was like, I don't want to be an indentured servant for I don't remember what the stipend
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.900]   was, but it was it was minimal.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:57.060]   And I figured if I'm just going to volunteer, then I'd rather volunteer in some other way.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.700]   But you've come through the path of the Peace Corps, and it would seem like that's probably
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:07.780]   a common path through. Do you have any advice, insight into the path of who should consider
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.300]   the Peace Corps and why?
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:21.380]   Yeah, absolutely. So it's not for everybody. The people who are very flexible and patient
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.820]   and you know, into trying new things, I think are great candidates. The advantage of the
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:33.020]   Peace Corps is compared to a lot of other long term volunteer opportunities is that
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:38.700]   to be a Peace Corps volunteer, you don't have to pay money. And so many of the other volunteer
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.700]   opportunities, even the year long, you know, there's World Teach, there's a variety of
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:50.260]   different things, many of them, you know, you have to pay money in order to spend your
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.460]   time to do something.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.380]   With the Peace Corps, you do earn very, very little. It's true. I think after two years
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:02.980]   when I got back, I think I had a check for $6,000. And during the two years that I was
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:10.100]   living in Benin, I earned about $6 a day, which is, you know, local kind of local living
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:19.500]   living expenses. But at the end, you know, I came back and a lot of my friends from college
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:26.220]   still hadn't managed to save $6,000. And I had a check, you know, to cover my first
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:31.140]   month's rent when I got home. So there are pluses and minuses. Two years is a very long
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:36.140]   commitment for some people. But you know, it's a really interesting experience. There's
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:43.140]   really nothing like it in the world. There's no other country that has a volunteer service
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:49.700]   where, you know, you're the people, you have diplomats all over the world that live at
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:56.060]   the level of the community and represent your country to people who have probably never
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.220]   met an American before in their life.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.660]   It is pretty cool. And I like all of my friends that went into the Peace Corps. And I'm happy
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.900]   that a lot of I guess the US American representation around the world I'm not so proud of. But
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.540]   most of the Peace Corps people, I am proud of that. And so it's nice to have that, that
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.380]   positive influence.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:21.060]   I could see some ways that somebody could put together a unique strategy for their personal
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:26.860]   financial situation. For example, taking advantage of if somebody had a lot of student loan debt,
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:32.180]   I could see the opportunity to take advantage of the Peace Corps as a way to have low living
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:36.740]   expenses. And yes, there's going to be low income. But by entering into some income-based
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:42.700]   repayment program, that could potentially lead to a substantial amount of that student
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.340]   loans forgiven for them.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.860]   And if that were put together with working for a nonprofit organization, if the NGO were
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.600]   structured in a nonprofit way, they could continue that process and they could live
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:02.660]   the adventure while having, yes, their salary, but also some of the back-end benefits accrue
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.540]   in their financial situation. Obviously, it would depend on the individual person.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.660]   But then also, those benefits could be used to put together the educational track, the
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:17.980]   experience track, perhaps the foreign language skill that could set somebody up for a very
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:22.700]   interesting and potentially long-term lucrative international career.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:29.540]   Yeah, exactly. And the nice thing about starting in Peace Corps is that Peace Corps, if you
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.100]   have, I believe it's federal student loans, they're deferrable while you're in Peace Corps.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.100]   So folks who are volunteering in developing countries don't necessarily have to worry
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.380]   during those two years about making those payments, and they can start to handle that
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:46.940]   when they get back, which gives them some breathing room while they're volunteering.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.140]   But it is a great way. And in general, volunteering overseas and learning a foreign language is
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:55.140]   a great way to kind of get started in the field.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.900]   Ultimately, most people, at least in international development and humanitarian work, have master's
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:06.220]   degrees. And so there is that question of student loans and getting your master's degree
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:14.820]   that also has to be managed. But if you manage it well, some employers will provide tuition
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.300]   reimbursement, that sort of thing. It's certainly doable.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:23.260]   That was going to be my very next question, is how to make yourself attractive in this
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:28.620]   environment. And my guess was going to be foreign language skills and academic degrees.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:34.540]   It would seem that academic degrees would be an important factor in that type of work
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.220]   environment. Do you have any other advice for people of how they can make themselves
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.700]   attractive in this marketplace?
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:48.340]   Yeah. You know, I think experience, the working experience in multicultural environments,
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:54.740]   whether or not it's in different countries, is extremely important. A lot of people try
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:59.780]   to enter the field with a -- you know, straight up, they come out of college, they get their
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.740]   master's degree, and they try to find a job. And so one way to set yourself apart, if you're
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.940]   interested in this field, is to have some work experience and be able to explain how
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.020]   that's applicable to the international field that you want to get into.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.300]   So if you're interested in international education, have you taught in the United States? That's
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.360]   very valuable, even just having, you know, a couple years of experience in a classroom.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.180]   Or if you're interested in global health, you know, have you worked at your public health
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:35.460]   department? Or have you done research? I think having experience is really what sets people
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:43.620]   apart from all of the applicants that have a master's degree but zero years of experience.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:49.980]   Two final questions. What's the toughest thing about the expatriate lifestyle?
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:38:00.300]   Oh. I think for us, a lot of things that are difficult for other people who are expatriates
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:07.980]   aren't as challenging, because we both chose this lifestyle, and it's because we decided
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:13.420]   together that the benefits outweigh the costs. But there are two things that are really difficult
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:22.980]   about it. One is that expatriate communities tend to be very transient. And so, not only,
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:28.900]   you know, we move every two to three years, but also most people in the expatriate community
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:34.620]   move, you know, every three, four, five years. And so as soon as you get to a new place,
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.800]   you know, it might take you six months or so to find your people and to make new friends.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.260]   And then, you know, maybe as short as a couple months later, they'll start to leave. And
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.740]   so it's very difficult to maintain a sense of community, even though expatriates in and
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:56.540]   of themselves do tend to be a community. It's difficult to have to make new friends everywhere
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:02.020]   you go every two to three years. That's tough. And then it's very hard to be away from family.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.220]   My family is very spread out all over the United States and all over the world, actually.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:13.740]   I have siblings on other continents as well. And my husband's an only child. So we're both
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:19.500]   very, very far away from our parents. And it's very difficult on our families that,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.460]   you know, we're only home once a year or once every six months.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:33.320]   We live in an interesting geopolitical climate. My last question is this. How's the morale
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:40.660]   in the Foreign Service and also in the NGO world? And have you seen any changes over
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.860]   past years?
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:50.020]   So I think what's really interesting about spending large portions of your life outside
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:59.860]   of the United States as an American is that it makes you very, very patriotic. I think
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:05.120]   a lot of people in the Foreign Service, in the United States Foreign Service and in NGOs
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:15.760]   that are US Americans, see the flaws of the United States very clearly. But also, you
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:25.400]   can't replace... There's nothing like the patriotism that people feel when they spend
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:32.160]   their lives outside of their native country. So I think in general, there's, you know,
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:38.020]   morale in the Foreign Service people in the Foreign Service, excuse me, are very patriotic.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.400]   And it's great to be around. You know, we do big Fourth of July parties. We do, you
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.160]   know, Thanksgiving celebrations together, celebrate all the American holidays. Even
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:53.240]   people who aren't actually diplomats serve that role and are diplomats to the people
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:58.600]   around them. But it's a very difficult, like you said, you know, there's a lot going on
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:14.640]   right now. And it's challenging. I think that as expatriates, people try to represent their
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.200]   country, to represent the good parts of their country. And in general, the people in the
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:26.080]   countries that we live in understand that just because they disagree with policies,
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:34.440]   or they disagree with actions, that doesn't mean that your government or your NGO or your
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:41.680]   business are the people behind those. In general, I think that people are very, very accepting
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.360]   of Americans and of foreigners in general around the world. It's making that one-on-one
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.040]   connection and, you know, not seeing somebody for just where they come from.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:56.400]   Yeah, it's been my, I mean, you've traveled much more extensively than I have, but it's
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:01.360]   been my experience has been remarkable and I've been definitely just have been made to
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.640]   feel welcome. I often feel more comfortable in other countries than I do in my own homeland.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.960]   And it's kind of... Yeah, it's funny.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   I mean, there's some of it is you almost, you feel bad, at least I feel bad about it
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.520]   sometimes, but you treat it like a VIP. And so sometimes you feel bad about it and sometimes
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.360]   you're just like, yeah, it's nice, nice to be treated as a VIP. And then you do try to
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.000]   do a good job to represent your homeland in a positive way.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:38.760]   Yeah, there's, you know, a lot of people suffer from the fishbowl effect. And so they, when
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.880]   they're living in foreign countries, they're very uncomfortable with the fact that they
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.800]   are constantly, they have to be constantly on and that people listen very carefully to
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:54.960]   what they say and watch what they do and, you know, will generalize their actions to
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:02.680]   the entire country. But I think you can look at it in a positive light. And if, you know,
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.120]   you're willing to see yourself as a representative of your country, no matter where you are in
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   the world. And sometimes that might mean, you know, watching how much you drink or being
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.760]   more careful about what you say in public and being sure that you represent your country
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:23.000]   and your organization in a positive light. You know, I think it's kind of freeing to
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.160]   be able to break people out of whatever stereotypes they might have about Americans by having
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.600]   them get to know me. Do you maintain a travel blog or anything
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:40.640]   like that that you'd like people to check out? I don't, but if I ever start one, I will
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:47.040]   go to the show notes and I will post the URL. Awesome. Well, Sarah, I appreciate you coming
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:54.680]   on the show and sharing your personal experience. It's definitely refreshing to talk to you.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.200]   And I think it really is an opportunity that people should consider for how to design a
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:05.440]   lifestyle. Many people crave some adventure in their life and it doesn't get much more
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.240]   adventurous than moving to a new place every two or three years. And why not get paid to
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:17.040]   do it and build some financial reserves along the way? Any final words of wisdom or closing
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:22.080]   remarks that you'd like to make? No. If anyone has questions or is interested
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:28.680]   in getting started and working in either NGO or government careers overseas, they should
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:34.480]   feel free to contact me. They can find me on the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:41.240]   and also the RPF Irregulars page. Perfect. Thanks so much, Sarah.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   My hope is that you can use this interview as inspiration for you to sketch out the plan
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.160]   that's appropriate to you and then move intentionally on it. As you can hear, Sarah and her husband,
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.480]   they didn't do it by accident. It was an intentional plan, carefully crafted, and it seems to be
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:00.920]   fitting exactly what they were looking to do. Now, you figure out what's right for you,
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:06.320]   but use this as inspiration to know that you don't necessarily have to wait. You don't
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.860]   necessarily have to travel the world as a broke tourist. Hey, if you want to go travel
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.800]   the world as a broke tourist, that's cool. But if you don't want to, you can figure out
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.840]   another path. And there are all kinds of exciting, interesting careers, doing jobs that matter,
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.640]   doing work that you can care about because of the impact that it's having on the people
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:31.000]   that you're serving and be paid handsomely for it as well. We live in an amazing time
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.440]   where the opportunities are massive. So thank you so much for listening. If you have an
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.280]   idea for a show like this or you think, "Joshua, hey, I might be a great guest," I'd be happy
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.200]   to hear from you. I get solicited a lot of times from people looking for guests, and
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.320]   I'll tell you, many of the professional guests, I turn them away at this point. But when someone
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:55.040]   who's a listener reaches out to me and says, "Hey, I got this idea," I almost always say
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.000]   yes. So if you feel like you've got an interesting story to tell, you've got something you think
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.120]   would benefit the audience, I'm not looking for you to be world-renowned. I'm just looking
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.960]   for you to have useful ideas. So that's one of the things I love about podcasting is that's
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:14.360]   very democratizing. I don't have to have whoever just is out trotting the publicity circuit
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.400]   promoting their book. Nothing wrong with that. I'm happy to do that when I feel strongly
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:23.200]   about it, but that's not always the goal. I like to talk with normal people who would
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.880]   just like to have an opportunity to share because all of you listening have some area
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:34.000]   that you're an expert. Every single one of you is superior to me in some area, and you're
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.800]   superior to everyone in the show, in the audience in some area. So if you've got an idea for
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:43.160]   a show, reach out to me. Email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. Always happy to hear from you.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.360]   Finally as we go, thank you to those of you who support the show on Patreon. That is my
