[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460]   - You have an anti to-do list,
[00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.220]   which I think is kind of total counter
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.500]   to how the average person might think about time.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.460]   How does that work?
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.700]   And how do you suggest people use something like that?
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.000]   - A to-do list was great.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.940]   And I kind of knew what I needed to address.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.540]   So I really just focused on the three to five
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.460]   most important things.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.620]   But there's all these things in my life
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.920]   that I'm trying to get better at.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.940]   Trying to avoid bad habits, whatever it might be,
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.220]   that I had no system in place
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.560]   for actually avoiding those things.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.660]   So I had a system for doing the good things
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.940]   that I wanted to do,
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.700]   but not a system in place for avoiding the bad things
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.340]   that I wanted to stay away from.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.500]   And so the anti to-do list is a system for doing just that.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.180]   It's for avoiding those places
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.420]   where you know you're gonna die.
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.180]   To paraphrase Charlie Munger,
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.680]   all I want to know is where I'm gonna die,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.020]   so I never go there.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.940]   These are the places where you're going to die,
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180]   metaphorically, and you're trying to avoid them.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.860]   Have those things top of mind
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.820]   so that they don't just become a bad habit
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.420]   that perpetuates in your world.
