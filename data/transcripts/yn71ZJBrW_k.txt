[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.300]   >> Again, please welcome our special guest of honor, Mr. Jack Bogle.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.840]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.580]   >> Surely you must have had enough Bogle by now.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.380]   God, I'm exhausted.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.420]   I'm all exhausted thinking about who you all are out in the office, having -- all out in
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.680]   the audience is having subjected yourself to this unusual form of torture.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.800]   But I always love being with you, and I'll say a little bit more about that later on.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.360]   I thought I'd just like to take a minute to talk about the development of Vanguard and
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.680]   the development of indexing at Vanguard, partly based on Gus's remarks.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.540]   And first let me say that there is -- in that Wall Street Journal article, it was so nice,
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.540]   championed the long term.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.960]   I love that.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.600]   There was a comment by Holman Jenkins that an industry graybeard told me that I would
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.800]   ruin the industry if I started a mutual company.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.960]   This was not a graybeard.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.320]   This was a man named John B. Lovelace, or John Lovelace.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.600]   His father, John B. Lovelace, was the founder of the American Fund Group out in Los Angeles,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.200]   and John was the head of it.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.180]   And he was a year ahead of me at Princeton.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.600]   So calling him a graybeard is not exactly accurate.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280]   But he was an important factor in the industry, not a big participant, but that has always
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.560]   been a very well thought of group, and he was a great guy, and he had to see me when
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560]   I was out in their offices.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800]   I visited around a lot in those days.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.280]   And when I was out in his office, he said, "I have to see you," and I said, "Well, I
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   can't do it now.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.440]   I've got a lot of meetings with your people.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.920]   And then I can't do it tonight because I've got a dinner engagement, and I'll be leaving
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.080]   tomorrow morning on the 7 o'clock plane to Philadelphia.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.220]   And so if you want to meet me at the airport, I'll meet you in the diner at 6 o'clock."
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.920]   So I went to the diner at 6 o'clock in all those covered little stools kind of thing,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.880]   like linoleum or something, and in there was John.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.480]   And after a brief, very brief introduction, he said, "I've heard that you're going to
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.240]   try and start a mutual company."
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   And I said, "That's true.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   I don't know if it's going to work or not.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.840]   We're still in the middle of no man's land with the board of directors in the summer
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.280]   of 1974, and no one knew how it was going to come out."
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.260]   And I said, "Yes, that's what I'm planning."
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.360]   And he said, "If you do that, you will destroy this industry."
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   But this is not a gray beard.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   This is a guy about my age and certainly with my Princeton heritage.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.040]   And he was very, very foresighted.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.520]   He did not destroy the industry, but if he just added, "You'll destroy this industry
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.080]   as we now know it," that is exactly what is happening now.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.400]   And the reason for that goes through a phrase I haven't used yet today, but I usually use
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.880]   it about 10 times a day when I'm trying to explain to an outsider what we're all about,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.360]   and that is we started with the structure, the mutual structure, and then developed from
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.560]   that structure, I have a speech called Strategy Follows Structure, a low-cost strategy.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.040]   The obvious thing to do if you have that structure, of which the highlight would, of course, be
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.160]   an index fund.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.880]   So that was strategy and structure together.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.320]   And it's amazing that it has worked this way.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   And I thought I'd just talk a little bit about the development of our index business.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.400]   First of all, because the point I'm trying to make is, every single thing I'm about to
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.520]   tell you was intuitive.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.720]   We had not a single formula.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.960]   I didn't understand most formulas.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.480]   I can probably read half of half of the articles in the Financial Analyst Journal and the Journal
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.320]   of Portfolio Management, or did I write half of them?
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.960]   I don't know, but something like that.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.600]   And it was all intuitive, and starting with Vanguard Index Trust, Burst Index Investment
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:27.120]   Trust as it was called in 1975 when it was formed, I did a crude comparison of the companies
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.800]   and the mutual funds in the industry.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.400]   There were about 60, it was all.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.800]   They're all pretty much large-cap, blue-chip kind of funds, very similar, and I compared
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.320]   them for 35 years for the S&P 500.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.600]   You saw that slide in my talk.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.120]   And the index won by 1.6%, I think was the number.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.840]   And 35 years later, or maybe it was 38 years later, that is to say a couple of years ago,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   I decided it would be interesting to see the correlation of that group of mutual funds
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.000]   in terms of their performance, how much was explained by the S&P 500.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.800]   So I put Mike Nolan to work, and it turned out to be 97.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.280]   In other words, if I produced that number, I would have been really confident, but this
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.280]   was just done intuitively without any of that.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   Then I decided that the S&P 500 would be the preferred index.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.960]   I hadn't really heard of much else.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.000]   I knew the Dow Jones was a terrible index, and the Wilshire wasn't even developed by
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.640]   then, total market index.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.920]   So we did start it with the S&P 500, and I thought, you know, it might be a good idea
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   for purists.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.880]   We thought about changing the structure of the fund to be a total stock market.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.160]   That made more sense, really, but no one had ever heard of the total stock market index.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.760]   So in 1985, we created the extended market index fund, the completion fund.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.180]   That's now our small, mid-cap and small-cap fund, and it's been very, very successful.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.320]   But the original idea was the intuitive idea that you want to go out and get the rest of
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.040]   the market.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040]   Statistical studies about that?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   None.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.840]   I didn't even know what the composition was.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.400]   At that point, we brought Gus Sauter in, because we now had two index funds, and we went on
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.320]   from there.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.160]   We started a bond fund, I think in '86.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.520]   That was not Gus's part of it.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.120]   And then in '89, I think, don't hold me to these dates, I didn't look them up, but around
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.800]   '89, we started an international fund.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.400]   And I had the intuition that EIFA, Europe, Australia and Far East, Japan was terribly
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   overpriced.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.440]   It was half the world's market cap at that time.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.000]   So I thought it would be a good idea to separate and have a European portfolio and a Pacific
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.620]   portfolio.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.620]   Strictly intuitive.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.620]   No data.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.400]   In fact, the Japanese market soon collapsed, kind of vindicated keeping them apart.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.520]   And that's where that came from.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.480]   Small cap fund, small cap index fund, in 1990, roughly, came when the manager for the small
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.800]   cap index that we had, small cap managed fund that we had, came into my office, and I was
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.760]   telling him what a terrible job he'd done, which he had.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.800]   And he said, and this is the first time I'd really thought about it, I said, "You know,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.740]   I think we're going to convert this into a small cap index fund."
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.740]   And we did.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.160]   I wasn't sure exactly how the small cap index worked, but it's worked okay.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.600]   It's basically the best small cap index around, although I don't like its concept particularly,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.360]   but that's another one.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.080]   Then we started those admiral funds, original admiral funds, for long, short and intermediate
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.680]   term treasuries, based on the way we ran our municipal bonds, have the shareholder choose
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.120]   between yield and volatility.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.220]   Then we started, this is a curious one, the growth and value funds.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:55.980]   I had said probably in 1990, the development of our growth and value funds, the formation
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.340]   of our growth and value funds, will come as soon as we have a growth and value index.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.940]   I didn't know what would be in the index, how would I know that?
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.660]   So Standard and Boors announced they were splitting the 500 into growth and value, so
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:13.440]   we started the fund, totally on intuition, on the basis that those two, growth and value,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.300]   would be the same in the future.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.720]   I warned people about switching on them, and they were, turns out from then to now, '93
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.460]   I think that was, growth and value had the same 9% return.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:33.340]   It happens that Morningstar says that these two funds, growth and value, are the oldest
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.420]   and largest factor funds in the industry.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.100]   So I will take credit for building the factor fund industry, but I don't want any credit
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.460]   for it because I don't believe in that.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.180]   I started them for a very different reason, and I want you to understand that you can
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.780]   have formulas and formulas and formulas, but if they don't comport with common sense, you
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.140]   don't want to have anything to do with them.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.140]   You can prove anything with data.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.900]   I've done my share, and so that's a little bit about the development.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:07.180]   We also tried quantitative, hire a quantitative manager, John Gorniak by name, to run Vanguard
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.380]   quantitative portfolios, and it seems so easy.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.940]   There's the S&P 500.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.740]   Just get rid of the five worst stocks or the three worst stocks, and all of a sudden you'll
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.740]   do well.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.740]   Seems easy.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:26.620]   It wasn't easy, and he barely outperformed the S&P 500 after taxes, I think, maybe underperformed
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.460]   with that quantitative portfolio, and I honestly can't remember if we still have a quantitative
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.380]   portfolio or not, but it didn't work.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.380]   When we had a managed fund, I picked the new managers by intuition.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.900]   When we had Windsor II, which I was assured would never do as well as Windsor, I picked
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:52.380]   the manager, Farrell Hanley, down in Dallas, and in fact, Windsor II has done a little
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.460]   bit better than Windsor, although they correlate very, very highly as they were supposed to.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.060]   Prime cap, I like the way these guys look.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.060]   They worked for American Funds.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:04.580]   They had a lot of experience, and they did a great job on that, so I want to emphasize
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:11.700]   that we can look at formulas until hell freezes over, but use your head, too, and it's just,
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.340]   to me, common sense.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:21.620]   Now, they say a word about managers with skill, which Gus mentioned.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:28.020]   Yes, there are some managers with skill, and sometimes they beat the market, but if you
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:34.300]   think of Vanguard in one way, and people don't talk about this, competitors, we don't even
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.820]   talk about it, you are investing for a lifetime, and find me a manager that has beaten the
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.180]   market for 75 years or 50 years.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.260]   They don't live that long.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.260]   Start with that.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.220]   That's an important qualification, and they turn over, and the manager's typical fund
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.900]   lasts eight years.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.780]   Half of the funds, I mentioned this the other day, yesterday, half of the funds go out of
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.540]   business every 10 years.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:10.340]   There is this genius who comes in the business just the day you come in, manages your money
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.460]   until your retirement, and then you both retire happily together and rich.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.820]   They don't exist, and by the way, it's at the time sequence.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.820]   How do you know to go to them?
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.340]   They don't have a record yet, so this industry is complicated.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.780]   Things that, to me, are very, very simple.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.620]   I think I said this the other day, but I'll repeat it because I like it.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:41.460]   When our guarantee for you, all you bogleheads and anybody else that comes to Vanguard, we
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.820]   will guarantee you that if you buy the 500 fund or the total stock market fund, and they're
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:52.620]   pretty much the same, very high correlation between the two, 98, 99, we will have the
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:12:00.260]   same non-manager when you buy the fund as you do when you redeem it, when you start
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.380]   to get conservative in your ancient years.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.980]   That makes sense.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:12.340]   It's investing for a lifetime that this is all about.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.180]   Those are just a couple of preliminary words.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:25.980]   I should say that, to what Gus said, I did a competition with Rob Arnott, who runs this
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.820]   smart beta fund, so-called, at the Super Bowl of Indexing.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:35.340]   I think that's the last one I went to, probably seven or eight years ago.
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.940]   He wasn't there, so a couple of us, I think Burt Malkiel was there and I was there, and
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.180]   Arnott was the third participant.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:50.140]   He was on a television screen, about five times our height.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:56.460]   When I talked to the crowd, I said, "We've got this giant Buddha hanging over our heads,"
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:03.300]   and in any event, the group there, Super Bowl, took a boat at the end of that meeting and
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:10.140]   they voted that the Bogle way, if you will, the standard and poorest 500 way, the market
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:18.100]   cap way, was going to be more successful than the Arnott way and the Jeremy Siegel way too.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.460]   That's exactly how it's turned out.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.620]   I told you the other day, they don't look much different.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.380]   Why would they look much different?
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.660]   But they're a little more risky or a little less risky, depending on which one you're
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.660]   talking about.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.140]   They have a little higher return if they're more risky and a little lower return if they're
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.140]   less risky.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.940]   I mean, you kind of look at today, they've had 19 years, 10 for one and nine for the
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.220]   other to prove they're right and they prove that they aren't bad, they're not disasters,
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.220]   but they add no value.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.260]   They actually subtract a little bit.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:54.220]   So all these things lead up to the fact that we're getting big and big and big and big.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.140]   So I'm spending a little bit of time thinking about risks to the concept of indexing.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.660]   I hope the people back at the ranch are doing the same thing.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.820]   The first one is we're taking in billions and billions and billions of dollars at very
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:15.220]   full market prices, not necessarily overvalued stock prices, but highly valued stock prices.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.780]   How will those investors feel when the decline comes in?
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.780]   It will come.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.060]   It always comes.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.140]   We could easily have a 20% decline and since markets do overdo anything, it could easily
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.980]   be 30% and then it'll be maybe a great value.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.980]   Who really knows?
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980]   I don't.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:34.260]   Number two, so that's one of the risks.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.580]   How will shareholders react to a bear market having taken all their money out of the other
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.580]   funds and put it into ours, index funds, and how will they react?
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.720]   Number two, and there's some things being written about this now, is the concentration
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:59.160]   of indexing in three firms and we all own, well, we own about 6% of the market.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:06.440]   State Street owns about 2.5% BlackRock, about 6%, same as we do, and yet it's a big difference
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.940]   in those three holdings.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.940]   What does one make of it?
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:15.040]   I don't know, but we're the only one that is focused on traditional index funds, a standard
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.680]   garden variety, buy it and hold it index funds, and those two are dominated totally.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:28.200]   State Street's 100% really exchange-traded funds and I guess BlackRock is 85% exchange-traded
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   funds.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   Does that make a difference?
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.880]   What happens when people start trading these things?
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.080]   Will they do well?
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080]   Will they do ill?
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.440]   How will those markets hold up?
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.760]   Those are big questions and it will be focused on index funds when that happens because that's
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.300]   what's driving the entire exchange-traded market.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.000]   And then there is the randomness of performance.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.100]   Think about this.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.240]   Every year we look at the performance data and we say the average fund was up X, let's
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:02.100]   say 6%, and the index was up 8, and the industry number is the number of funds.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.640]   So if you get a few very good performing funds, it doesn't help.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.280]   If it was market weighted, market cap weighted, it would be very different.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.360]   So that can turn against you.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   Small cap funds, little funds, they do much better.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.920]   They won't do much better for very many people, but they will make the index look like it's
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.160]   underperforming when in fact it's not.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.160]   So how will we deal with that?
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.640]   I don't know.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.360]   And then there's the 10% rule.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.880]   The 1940 Act says, the 1940 Act, the Investment Company Act, says that no mutual fund can
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.080]   own more than 10% of any corporation, essentially.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.600]   We own 6%.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.700]   What happens when you get to 10?
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:47.640]   Spend a minute thinking about that, and then I will take you to a famous comment from the
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.180]   great Daniel Rumsfeld, another fellow Princetonian, but not the nicest guy I ever met.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:58.920]   And he says, I've talked to you about the known unknowns.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.000]   What about the unknown unknowns?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.160]   And that's a good question, which I will now answer for you.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.400]   I'm only kidding.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.760]   So let's take your questions.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.240]   OK, Jack, the first question is from Kenner.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.520]   He said, how does it feel to have beneficially transformed the investment world in order
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.360]   to give individual investors a fair share of the world's economic progress and to have
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.600]   enhanced the lives of millions of your fellow citizens?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   Good.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   OK.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:41.000]   I could have answered that one, and I figured that was the answer, but--
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.680]   I might even say, although I think the word "very" is overused in our lives, I might even
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.520]   say "very good."
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.280]   This question is from Stay the Course.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.640]   It says, if you were born Jack Yashihara in Japan instead of Jack Bogle in America, would
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:04.880]   you still be advising 100% home country bias, or did you have some prescient feeling America
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.360]   would do this well the last 50 years?
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:14.940]   Well, look, this home country bias is a bunch of baloney.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.560]   Think about it for a minute.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.400]   The American corporations get half of their revenues and half of their profits from outside
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.840]   the US.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.320]   So you have a diversified international portfolio already.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:34.240]   Now, there are arguments you should add "international" or "non-US," and it's correct that these companies
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.200]   outside the US, indexes outside the US, have a lower price-earnings multiple.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.480]   As I said with Bill Bernstein the other day, does that mean that they're just riskier,
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.160]   or does that mean they're cheaper?
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.140]   I don't know the answer to that question, and I don't know anybody else who does.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:58.240]   The one thing I've learned in my career here, 65 years, is this is a hard business.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.160]   It's a hard business to win at.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.600]   So doing the simple things and getting cost out of the equation is the best thing to do.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:10.920]   And everybody needles me, everyone, Vanguard doesn't even like it when I talk about it,
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.780]   about being international.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.780]   I don't do it.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.780]   Am I telling you not to do it?
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.780]   Of course not.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.000]   Am I going to tell you because international has done so much better and non-US has done
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.240]   so much better in the last 25 years, since I first went into it in detail in my first
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.520]   book, 23 years, I guess.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.280]   Does that mean it'll do the same in the next 10 years?
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.640]   I'd be astonished if it did that well in the next 10 years.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640]   Could it do worse?
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.280]   Of course it could do worse.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.480]   So you just don't know, and it pays your money and it takes your choice, and I don't want
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.080]   to intimidate anybody into not buying international, although I do think diversifying at the market
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:53.560]   weight, which would mean non-US stocks are, I think, around 43% of the world market, is
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.760]   more than most US investors should have.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.960]   And to me, it's just a matter of logic.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.640]   But if someone throws a big formula at it and proves I'm wrong again, believe me and
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.960]   not the formula.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   I guess a little background on this for those who aren't aware, Warren Buffett has directed
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:23.840]   that his estate go into treasuries and the S&P 500 index.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:31.400]   And this question asks, what is your take on Warren's choice of the S&P 500 versus the
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.360]   total stock market?
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:41.480]   Well, I asked him about that, actually, and he didn't answer.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.880]   And first of all, there's not very much difference.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.820]   The correlation, as I said, is, I think, 0.98 between the total stock market index.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.820]   The S&P 500 represents 85% approximately of the total market.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.040]   They can't be too different.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.140]   So I'm not about to argue with him.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.320]   I think a more interesting proposition is why he picked the US.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.200]   Home country biased idiot.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.420]   I'm kind of a little high here.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:22.120]   I had my martini before.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.700]   So I'm kind of relaxed about my answers.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.960]   I don't mean to be cavalier.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.400]   That's an excellent point, though.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.440]   I hadn't even thought of that.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.440]   I'm sure a lot of investors have.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.140]   Oh, I'm thinking about it all the time.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.040]   This next question is a two-part question.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.680]   What is the ideal blend of treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds in a long-term
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   portfolio?
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:53.960]   And the second part, any necessity for or significant benefit from an international
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.720]   bond holding in a long-term portfolio?
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.680]   I think you can probably answer the second one in one word, right?
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.640]   Well, the international thing kind of mystifies me.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.720]   It's not going to make much difference what you do as long as international bonds have
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.480]   the same quality and protective nature that US bonds do.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.300]   So there's some questions I just don't have a good answer to.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   And that's one of them.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.120]   I think it comes down to a preference.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:32.960]   I do think that it's maybe a little bit preemptory to put these holdings of international bonds
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:42.400]   and individual stocks into the retirement plans, target date retirement funds, without
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.120]   asking stockholders would they like it, because there are quite large dimensions.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.000]   I think Mike will have to correct me here, but maybe 35% international stocks, both the
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.240]   stock position, and 35% international bonds, both the bond position, something like that,
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Mike?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.280]   30 and 30?
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   40 and 30.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:10.120]   I mean, that's a big change, and if they all do the same, it's fine.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:17.040]   And I even hope somebody talked about it, even thinking of having target date funds
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.960]   that are US-oriented and target date funds that are world-oriented.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.600]   Funds are large enough easily to accommodate that.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.480]   But in any event, that's not the way it happened, and I think we should always have
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.400]   options available that don't encompass international stocks and bonds.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.720]   It's an important choice, and whether there's going to be a big difference, I don't know,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.600]   but my intuition, you know, maybe I'm just proud to be an American, or at least I know
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   I'm free.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.800]   There's a song that goes that way, called "God Bless the USA," which I will say
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.840]   to all of you, God bless the USA, too, a big part of our family culture.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.800]   And the first part was -- The first part was, what is the ideal blend
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.400]   of treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds in a long-term portfolio?
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:12.320]   Well, I have always said the best blend is not -- and this talks about, you know, intuition
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.160]   and not maybe thinking things quite through adequately, which is certainly what I have
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.160]   done, and that is when we started the bond fund, I just took the bond index.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:25.600]   I figured it was representative, and it turns out it's 70 percent in treasuries and government-guaranteed
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.640]   mortgages, and that didn't matter much in those days, because the yields were running
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.360]   around 8 percent, but today it matters quite a bit.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:41.480]   So you start and reflect, times have changed, and I would think it would be desirable to
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:47.880]   have a fund like that, you know, just top of the head, maybe 50 percent high-grade corporates
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:55.080]   and 50 percent treasuries and other government-backed mortgage, 50/50, just for the fun of it.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.720]   Those corporates are now only about 30.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.560]   So a better representation for a higher yield, and higher yield will lead to a longer return,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.000]   holding everything else equal in the long run, as we all know.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.480]   And somebody says, well, that doesn't match the allocation of the index.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.880]   Well, wait a minute, pal.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.000]   Where do you think that balanced index fund came from?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.940]   When I started that, 1993, I think it was, you know, I said 60/40.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.360]   I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it, but that seemed like a reasonable number,
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:33.400]   and there's no 60/40 index, except for the index fund, which is the standard.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:42.440]   And so some of this, I think we can overthink, well, having said that, I made a lot of mistakes
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:48.000]   in doing all the things I've done, and sometimes intuition doesn't work as well as I think.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.960]   Sometimes my self-confidence is a little bit on the high side, compared to what turns out.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.200]   I mentioned picking that quantitative manager.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:03.480]   So I've had some failures, funds that we started that didn't do anything.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:10.920]   And so I don't have a good answer, but I do think there should be available to investors
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:18.040]   who want to take the extra risk in these days of very low-yielding bonds, if you want to
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.840]   take a little bit of extra risk.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   You can do it now, by the way, by just owning a treasury fund and our corporate bond, high-grade
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.640]   corporate bond index fund, and it'll do fine.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.440]   But people don't seem to like to do that, and it's hard to explain on the phone.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.800]   Telemarketing is difficult when you've got to explain things to everybody.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:44.600]   So I think it's a good idea, but hard to implement.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.840]   >> Jack, this isn't a prepared question, but since you mentioned target date funds, I brought
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:55.560]   up a question that I get asked a lot and I don't know the answer for, and maybe you do.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.960]   Why aren't there admiral shares of the target date and the life strategy funds?
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.600]   They use the investor share class in all of them, even if you had a million dollars in
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.720]   the fund.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.640]   We like to try to recommend to people that they simplify their portfolios, and a great
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   way to do it is either with the target date funds if you want the glide path or with the
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:23.560]   life strategy funds if you want a consistent asset allocation.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.240]   So when people put a lot of money in there, it seems like they should be able to get the
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.560]   admiral shares.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:35.920]   >> Well, Michael, correct me if I'm wrong, which he does all the time, by the way, but
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.760]   don't the admiral shares buy the -- don't the target date funds buy admiral shares or
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.440]   they buy them an asset value?
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.040]   An asset value?
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.960]   The funds don't pay an investor share price.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.920]   They do?
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.440]   I'll talk to the management tomorrow.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:08.360]   >> I've tried to get an answer from Vanguard and I haven't been successful, Jack, so hopefully
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   you will.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.080]   >> You might make a note of that, would you?
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:19.240]   >> I mean, it seems if they put -- the total amount needed to get the asset class of those
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.040]   would probably be much higher because of the underlying things, but it still seems if you
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   put $100,000, whatever the requirement is, it still seems like there should be a number
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   where they were able to get the admiral share classes.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.960]   >> Well, there may be some rational answer to that, but I don't have it for you.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.800]   >> I was wondering if there was any legal reason that you're aware of, but it seems
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.960]   like they're using the investor class, so I don't see any reason why they couldn't use
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.960]   the admiral class.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:59.000]   >> Well, I take the credit or the blame for that if that's the way we run the life strategy
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.920]   funds, because I started them and the target date funds were, of course, just an outgrowth
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:10.120]   of the life strategy funds, and so that's probably a question I didn't ask.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.880]   You know, I'm usually so good at asking all the tough questions, so what can I do?
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   Apologize?
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   I don't know.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   We'll get an answer.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.880]   >> Great.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   Great.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   Thank you.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.880]   This question is from Jay Willis.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:27.040]   It says, "Should an investor attempt to factor in the effects of quantitative easing into
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.760]   their investment plan, or is it more likely to be a short-term event unworthy of consideration?"
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.960]   >> Well, the answer to the first part of the question is clearly yes, but I have no idea
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.320]   how to do it.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   [ Laughter ]
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:47.240]   I mean, there's a point at which you have to accept the flaws and foibles of the market
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.000]   for what they are, and this very low yield, even negative yields somewhere around the
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.320]   world are there, and you may not like it, but that's the marketplace.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:03.560]   I don't know what you would do if you take quantitative easing into account, honestly,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:11.440]   and I would also say that it can't go on forever, and interest rates can't stay this low I don't
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.120]   think forever, although I would have said it had gone on long before this, gone back
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:24.200]   up long before this, and there's some questions that even the "Great Bogle" doesn't know the
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:30.040]   answer to, and so I look at this with the same kind of mystery you do, but I don't know
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:37.360]   what to do about it, so I'm roughly 50/50, have bonds and stocks, mostly index funds,
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:45.840]   communities in my personal account, and corporates and taxables, treasuries, bond market, in
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:52.600]   my intermediate term, bond market fund, not the total bond market fund, and that gives
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.360]   you a little advantage in yield, and I just do it, and I don't pay a lot of attention
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   to it.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.400]   I mean, I don't think I look at my portfolio, I know I don't do it once a year, I mean,
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.080]   I know roughly what's in there, I don't even know any more than that.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:13.040]   I think sometimes we complicate simple things, I mean, the idea of rebalancing, for example,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.240]   is okay, if you know what you're doing, and knowing you're sacrificing all the time your
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:23.120]   higher-yielding asset, but you're reducing the volatility as markets go up, that's good
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.440]   in the one hand and bad in the other, but to do it too frequently, to do it every time
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.800]   as a one-point change in the ratio, it's just silly, it doesn't matter.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.480]   So it's simplify, simplify, simplify.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.160]   I think that's a quote from Thoreau.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:44.680]   What do you think about the theory, though, that because of the low interest rate environment,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:52.520]   that a lot of people are going out and investing in the market, in equities instead, to try
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:32:00.920]   to get a return, and that when the easing eases, that a lot of those people will be
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.960]   bailing and going to higher-yielding things.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.880]   Do you think that's a correct analysis or not?
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:15.160]   First of all, at the margin, it's hard to even express these things.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.240]   Would I recommend a wholesale shift that way?
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   That'd be insane.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.920]   Would I recommend maybe a marginal change to capitalize on your feelings?
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.960]   I'm not much of a believer in that, but I don't see any reason you couldn't do 5% in
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:34.000]   high-yielding stocks, higher-yielding stocks, or the-- what do we call-- high-dividend yield
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   fund.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   I thought that was a good idea.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.960]   That didn't happen to be mine, but I thought it was a good idea.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.920]   And the same thing with bonds.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.160]   When interest rates go up, bonds are going to go down.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.640]   But stocks are going to go down, too, because the interest rate, the premium, equity premium,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   will have to shrink.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.360]   I mean, if it stays the same, bonds will move hand-in-hand.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.080]   Stocks will move hand-in-hand with bonds, just that that number is going to stay stable.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   It doesn't stay totally stable, and sometimes it's very counterintuitive, but that's kind
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.720]   of the right way to look at it.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.000]   So there really isn't a good haven.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.480]   And my own view is that reaching for yield is a very risky thing to do.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   It looks fine.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.600]   You get the income.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.000]   And then all of a sudden, it stops.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.280]   And you've gone too far out in the limb, to use the metaphor, and the limb snaps off.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.320]   So what I say is you should never use high-yielding bonds.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.080]   5% of your bond position, maybe even 10%, won't kill you.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.020]   It won't change your monthly check very much.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.680]   But as compared to shifting entirely into high-yielding bonds, which I don't think is
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   a good idea.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   I mean, I'm a diversification guy.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:51.420]   And I'm a believer in, finally, the investor has to accept the rate of return that's available
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.680]   in the marketplace.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.520]   Doing otherwise means you're accepting greater risk.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.640]   And I'm just conservative, simple.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.120]   And it's worked for me for the better part of 65 years.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.520]   And could it have worked better, by the way?
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.520]   Yes.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:18.320]   I've been down 50% in equities ever since 2009.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   But I didn't go down.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.040]   I got a little nervous when the market went down 50%.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.240]   Anybody does.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.620]   So there is, as Gus mentioned, actually your own investor tolerance for these things.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:37.680]   But stay in the mainstream, or using the analogy I use in Little Book of Common Sense investing,
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.960]   have a funny money account, 5% of the total.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.360]   And play games over there, do whatever you want, anything you want.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.840]   Buy new issues, buy real estate, whatever you want to do.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.680]   And with 95% in your serious money account, that's what you're going to send your kids
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.320]   to college on, that's what you're going to retire on, that's what you're going to have
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.160]   a long life with.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.120]   That's going to be the basis of any sound investment program.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:11.080]   All this implies, by the way, that normalcy, as we know it, kind of continues.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.320]   This is a risky world we're in, a very risky world.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:20.920]   We've talked about the risk of Russia, the risk of China, the risk of nuclear war, the
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:30.280]   risk of some idiot in North Korea, heaving a bomb across the Pacific Ocean, and a certain
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:36.800]   candidate who says we'll just take him out, which is probably not the worst idea ever.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.520]   And maybe one of his only good ideas, by the way.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:46.440]   Oh, I don't want to get into politics, I've had enough of that.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:54.200]   And disease comes along, global warming is there, economic weakness around the world,
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.880]   over-leveraged world.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.720]   This is a risky time, and the stock market seems to ignore it.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.120]   Can it continue to do that?
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.440]   Well, like everything else, that all depends.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.160]   All depends how it comes out.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.600]   But we're very much out of balance here in the U.S. and all over the world is even worse
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.520]   in terms of the amount of borrowing, the amount of that Federal Reserve balance sheet, never
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.720]   been looked like this before the last five years.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.760]   And I'm not so sure what to make of all these things and which of these risks come home
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:30.520]   to roost, but anyone investing today just has to be aware of the big risks out there.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:38.040]   In my Common Sense on Mutual Funds book, the first sentence says something like, "Investing
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.560]   is an act of faith."
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.440]   Truer words were never said.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.920]   An act of faith that our nation will prosper.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.720]   An act of faith that our corporations will continue to earn money and have it grow and
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.440]   pay dividends.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.320]   An act of faith that our investment intermediaries will give you your fair share of the market
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.440]   returns that are developed from that.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.840]   And this is all faith.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.200]   There are no facts here.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.960]   It's based on the past.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.760]   But the past is, as I said the other morning, talking about a completely different subject,
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.320]   the past is rarely prologue.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.800]   So we live in an uncertain world, and anyone that doesn't understand that should do I don't
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:23.920]   know what, but not save, because as I said before, the one way to be sure you end up
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.160]   with nothing is to save nothing.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.000]   And that's the only certain proposition that I can think of at the moment.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.480]   So I'm not sure that's a very good answer, but I think we should all be aware of just
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:43.080]   the systematic risks, the broad risks that lie out there, let alone the risks that lie
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.880]   here in the U.S., which you're all well aware of.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.240]   >> This question is from Lady Geek, who's here and who's one of the mainstays in the
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.120]   Bowheads Forum.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:38:01.000]   Do you think the fiduciary standard will have the intended impact as you first envisioned
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   it to be?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.040]   >> The answer to that is absolutely.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.240]   That is going to make much bigger change than anybody now envisions.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:15.160]   You know, it's fine right now, this is a curious anomaly, it's limited due, it comes out of
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.040]   the Department of Labor, what have they got to do with the fiduciary standard?
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.440]   Where's the SEC here?
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.660]   And the Department of Labor, so it only applies to retirement plans.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.440]   So we have this, I think I touched on this the other day, this awful anomaly of you've
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:36.120]   got a client here with a retirement plan and a regular plan, you have to honor your fiduciary
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.560]   duty with his retirement plan, but you can go rip him off on his regular plan.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.840]   Obviously, that's not going to happen.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   More likely is that if you have a client that has only a retirement plan and another client
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.320]   that has no retirement plan, which is the standard account, is any broker with a half
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.540]   a brain going to treat the other client less favorably?
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.760]   I don't think so.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:07.640]   So I think the system will actually, free financial enterprise system, capitalism, will
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.560]   work to iron this out.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:18.240]   And so the fiduciary standard will spread either intuitively or by practice, probably
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.880]   before the SEC gets around to saying, which they should do, that a fiduciary duty applies
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.560]   to all anyone that touches other people's money, as I said the other day, including
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.880]   financial institutions that are managing all that money.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.780]   Can you imagine them not having a fiduciary duty in law?
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.120]   I can't.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:41.160]   And so that will come, probably a long time, probably hard fought.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.040]   But it's interesting to say, we really don't want to put the customer first.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:51.520]   Or as I said in one of the articles I wrote, yeah, I'm putting my own interests first
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.320]   and the customer second, but the difference is really small.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.640]   It doesn't seem to me like something you want to say to your customer in the morning.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.200]   So but it's going to spread, as I've written at some length and as I used the other day
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.900]   in my Adam Smith quote, it's going to happen even without a fiduciary rule.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.680]   People are going to have to serve the investor.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:19.080]   Producers are going to have to assume responsibility for consumers, giving them the best deal in
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   town.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.080]   They'll go out of business.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.200]   And so we're going to see a lot of change in this business.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.240]   And indexing is going to put a lot of pressure on people.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.440]   And you can't really get to indexing enthusiastically until you get to mutuality.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:37.880]   And it may be before my days end, there will actually be another mutual company or two.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:43.440]   I tried to do a couple, tried to persuade the Putnam directors, a complete disaster.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.280]   They wouldn't do it.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.360]   And look at them now.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   Oh, my God.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.320]   I mean, they used to be the fifth largest firm in the industry.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.520]   Now they're probably 30th, 25th, I don't know where.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.800]   And terrible performance, high cost.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:06.920]   They brought in, interestingly enough, a guy from Fidelity Marketing to run the new Putnam.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.800]   They should have brought in an investment guy.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.920]   They need help everywhere, and they're not going to get it.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.120]   They're probably going to go out of business.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.420]   That wonderful name that was one of our big competitors in the '30s and '40s.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:24.400]   So the industry is going to change, and they may not like it.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:31.840]   Although I will say, this is a editorial comment, that I kind of hoped, given that I've completed
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:38.360]   65 years of service in this industry, including two years as chairman of the board of the
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:44.640]   Investment Company Institute, that maybe, just maybe, somebody down there would say,
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.520]   you know, let's bring old Bogle down here and have him make a little farewell speech.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   Not going to happen.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.520]   Now, why is that?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.920]   Think about that for a minute.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.760]   The most successful company in the industry's history created that.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.920]   The most successful strategy in the industry's history, he created that.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.000]   Well, he hadn't done enough.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.680]   But do you think the SEC is going to be shamed into covering non-retirement accounts?
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.040]   They're going to have to do it.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.280]   They're going to have to do it.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.040]   I think they're getting too bureaucratic, and Mary Jo White has a lot of conflicts of
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.040]   interest.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.240]   I think she's a good person, but handling the kind of conflicts she has, and coming
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.400]   in the-- and she had no connection with the mutual fund industry, which is a dominant
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.000]   industry that they regulate.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.960]   And I mean, this is a, I guess, $18 trillion, roughly, industry.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.040]   And they got this big guy out there that I hope they're watching, who has about $3.5
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.560]   of those $18 billion, 20%, about right.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:56.640]   And so, they aren't, I don't think, strong in the investment division, investment management
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:01.280]   that covers mutual funds, doesn't have the strong leadership, and I've been through a
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:07.360]   bunch of leaders down there, and worked with a lot of them, really quite successfully,
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.200]   I think, getting what I needed done.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.720]   I'll tell you a little anecdote, since we have a little time.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.080]   I once went to see the director of the division named Mary Ann Smyth, and they always used
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.040]   to ask me, "Where are your lawyers?"
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.400]   And I said, "I don't travel with lawyers."
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.920]   You know, I got eight lawyers in the room.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.440]   And I always followed the principle, "He who travels fastest, travels alone."
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:38.000]   And so, I was down there, and I was about an hour early, naturally, for a meeting with
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   her.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.400]   I was trying to straighten out the name of the, I think it was the bond fund, they didn't
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.600]   like bond index fund.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:51.120]   And so, I'm sitting down there, and they had a Roy Rogers, or something like that.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.760]   Is that a place you eat?
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.240]   Yeah, that's what it was.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.440]   And I was kind of looking, I was thinking maybe about the cheeseburger, and it has an
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.080]   awful lot of calories.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.960]   And up next to me comes Mary Ann Smyth, looking for her hamburger.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.520]   So she said, "Why don't you come up, and we'll have lunch together before the meeting."
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   You know, you don't get that kind of stuff if you're a bureaucrat, if you really have
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.920]   an entourage with you.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.560]   And we really got along fine.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.680]   And I didn't quite make my point, I said, "Okay, if we can't call it the Vanguard Bond
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:32.400]   Index Fund, we'll call it the Vanguard Bond Market Index Fund, oh, that'll be fine."
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.800]   Every name has a funny derivation.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.520]   I've seen all this.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.640]   It's really strange, and it's really wonderful.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:45.000]   Many events have been very painful for me to endure.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:53.280]   In retrospect, every one of them is memorable, because of the fun it was, the memories it
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   gave me.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:45:01.040]   You know, they say victory has a thousand fathers, and defeat is an orphan.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.480]   But I kind of revel in my defeats.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:09.440]   I said to you the other day, if I hadn't been fired from Wellington, there would be no Vanguard.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   Think about that.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.200]   A world without Vanguard, I mean, I can't imagine it.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.200]   But that's only me.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   You'll have to figure that for yourself.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.740]   >> Nor a world without Jack Bogle.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.240]   This question is from BoglerDude.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.000]   He said, "Is there a valuation level where it would make sense to invest internationally?"
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.720]   >> Well, sure, but we just don't know what it is.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:41.160]   I mean, these questions are fine, but tell me how to figure that out, and then tell me
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.080]   what you're going to do in the way of market timing.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.920]   I mean, then the valuation level is high, so you get out, and then it's low, and you
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.920]   get back in.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.200]   Who can do all that?
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:56.040]   The international problem is no different from the same problem you have in the US.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.800]   You don't want to put your money in the stock market when it's overvalued.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:04.360]   But you put it in every day, and half of the time, well, it's overvalued probably 10% of
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:10.280]   the time, undervalued probably 25% of the time, and has a good growth potential most
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.800]   of the rest of the time.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.400]   You're playing odds.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:18.080]   And the one thing you have to do is protect yourself against your own weaknesses.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:27.040]   And thinking you can decide in and out values and when to do it is, I think, superhuman.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.320]   And as Gus pointed out, well-known fact, that if you're getting out of the market, somebody
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.080]   else is getting in.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:39.480]   And one of my favorite stories is I heard somebody say there's said to be, I think it's
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.960]   $300 billion sitting on the sidelines.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.280]   When that money comes in to be invested in the stocks, you're going to really see quite
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   an explosion.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.560]   And I said, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:57.480]   If they spend that $300 billion on stocks, how much do you think will be left in the
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   saving reserve?
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480]   And he said, zero.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.560]   I said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.000]   Somebody is going to sell them those stocks, and it's going to be the same $300 billion
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.920]   in the reserve account as there was before it all happened.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.640]   It's just a different $300 billion.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:17.560]   There's no way around the fact that the market is kind of this circular thing.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:24.760]   So if you're doing one thing and the market is doing another, it's a closed circuit.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:31.320]   And so you're then betting against somebody else, as Gus said this morning, too.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.520]   And I just, I think to the extent you can get the idea that the market is a casino and
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:41.880]   you can bet and win is about the same as thinking that the casino is a casino and you can just
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.240]   bet and win.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.160]   The more you bet, the more you lose.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:51.200]   And every study that's ever been done, talk about intuitive, says the more you trade,
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.760]   the worse you perform.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.680]   Of course it is.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.960]   Because buyers and sellers aren't equal.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.440]   They're equal to each other.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.280]   But the man in the middle takes his hunk.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:09.400]   And that will eventually, I think, put pressure on people who are using ETFs for such less
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.200]   than noble purposes.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.680]   The fringe element I talked about the other day that made no sense at all except marketing
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.960]   sense.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:24.640]   And Gus certainly got Arnott right up there by saying he's got a great marketing message.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.760]   And these ETFs are about marketing.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.480]   ETFs are about financial buccaneers.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.760]   Not all of them, but most of them.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:38.760]   And so they're another kind of big if in the future of indexing, too.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.920]   Well, Jack, given your views on, your opinions on international investing, can you give us
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:48.280]   a little background, a history of how Total International came about?
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:54.520]   Well, I started the International Fund because I thought there was a definite place for international
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.480]   in the mutual fund industry among investors who wanted international exposure.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.640]   And did I think it through in the same way I do today?
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.440]   I mean, I didn't think whether it would help them or hurt them.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.800]   I thought it was a viable option.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:15.120]   And it really is funny that we started off-- before we got to the International Index Fund,
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.080]   we started the International Eyes, the old Ives Fund, that fund that failed so badly.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.560]   And we divided it into an international portfolio of 50% and the US portfolio of 50%.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:30.960]   And the year after we did that, the international portfolio went up 100%.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.960]   Brilliant.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   No.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.720]   Market timing.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Luck.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.360]   And, I mean, that's 100% in a year.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.680]   It's amazing.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.920]   And you can check it in your little prospectus or something.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   You check me, Mike.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.000]   I'm pretty sure I'm right.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.520]   And but it was a very large number.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.120]   But it's a legitimate option for those who want it.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.680]   I just don't think everybody should have it built into their investment objectives.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   And I think you should understand what you're doing and what you're getting.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.040]   And one thing I say about internationals-- and this is all such common sense.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:12.720]   I mean, I feel like I'm revealing the secrets of the world behind a curtain.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.160]   But before you do anything on the international, look at the International Index.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:23.640]   Well, the largest company in the International Index is Great Britain.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.320]   The second largest is Japan.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.960]   And the third largest is France.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:37.200]   Britain, Japan, and France-- they're probably, let me take a guess, at 23% or 4% of the total
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.360]   International Index.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.840]   I don't think Britain is doing so well.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.480]   They don't even know what they're going to do about the so-called Brexit.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.240]   They're still struggling with even-- they've never even voted to actually do it.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.040]   The parliament is going to have to do that someday or go back for another vote, which
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.520]   I think is highly unlikely.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.880]   But they have a troubled economy.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:01.240]   They have this total question about the exit from the European Union.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:08.280]   They have the likelihood that if they do that, Scotland will break off, and the United Kingdom
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.760]   will only have one kingdom-- Britain.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:19.800]   And so it doesn't seem like the best of the place you'd want a big hunk of your money.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.480]   Now, I could be wrong, and that valuation's maybe good, but kind of when you look at it
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:29.080]   in this way, Japan, my god, they've got the worst demographics in the world, the lowest
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:38.320]   ratio of probably about one to one of workers to retirees, raising the question of what
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.840]   happens to the last in the US?
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:47.600]   What happens to the last Social Security recipient when the last employer dies?
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:57.720]   This would be a problem, and then there's-- they get a tsunami periodically, and a very,
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:02.520]   very structured economy, and a very, very structured culture.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.240]   I'm just not so sure that's going to be a good place to invest, struggling economically
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:11.440]   a lot, one prime minister after another, and they don't seem to be able to find the answer.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.200]   And then there's France.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.720]   They don't work in France.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:24.160]   Well, that may be a little hyperbole, but they sure take the summer off, and it doesn't
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.160]   seem like--
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   >> And they strike a lot.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.960]   And Germany seems to be doing a good job.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:34.600]   They're fourth, but I only wanted to make my point by using the three bad ones.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:41.960]   But you are owning countries, and to accept the index without knowing what's big, S&P
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.480]   500, for example, we all know how totally dominated it's been in recent years by the
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:53.680]   Googles and the Alphabets and the whatevers, and Microsoft a little bit now, things like
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:01.480]   that, as compared to the conventional leaders, Exxon, not having a very good time either
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.000]   for a whole lot of reasons.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.640]   So we don't really know how to deal with all that, except that these are very highly valued
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:13.160]   stocks compared to-- maybe not compared to their prospects, but compared to the leaders
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.640]   years ago.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.960]   But it's still, just to come back to our friend Norman, I mentioned this before, but I'm going
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:26.560]   to mention it again, OK, they've had 19 years to do it, and they can't do it.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:33.040]   He and Jeremy Siegel together, a little higher reward and a little lower reward, respectively,
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:39.240]   a little higher risk and a little lower risk, respectively, and a sharp ratio risk-adjusted
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.600]   return that's a little lower than the S&P 500.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.480]   They haven't proven anything, and they've had 19 years of business between the two of
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   them to prove it.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.800]   And that's not good enough for me, but they prove it in advance.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.240]   This is a great business.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.040]   You can prove anything in advance.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.040]   But will it happen?
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.920]   Read the articles in the Financial Analyst Journal by the professors, and they've got
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   these formulas-- oh, head over heels, and they're incomprehensible to me.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.240]   But they come and they go.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.360]   It's just not a profitable thing to do.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:13.760]   Bill Sharpe, by the way, said, "Smart beta is stupid."
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:18.280]   That was his contribution to the debate, which is good enough for me.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.000]   This is an interesting question from Nyssa Prius.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.620]   He said, "What can you tell me about the process of picking ticker symbols?
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.920]   Who chooses them?
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.520]   How are they negotiated?
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.320]   Is there a market among mutual fund companies in ticker symbols?
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:40.680]   Why did Vanguard pick BND for the total bond ETF, leaving bond available for PIMCO total
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.880]   return?
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:50.560]   Did Vanguard marketing think BND was better?"
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.960]   I think that's above my pay grade.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:01.320]   I have absolutely no idea, but I do think one of the more interesting things that happened
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:07.120]   in our ETFs is they were originally called vipers, to contrast with the spiders.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:11.480]   And after about three years, somebody said, "Aren't vipers dangerous?"
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:16.840]   Well, it shouldn't have taken them three years to figure out that vipers are dangerous.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.840]   We all know that.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.840]   So I just don't know the answer to that question.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.400]   No, I'm not sorry at all, actually.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.600]   It wasn't your fault, right?
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.000]   So that's why you don't know the answer.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.400]   This question is from Chris001122.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.480]   As one of the best financial geniuses of the 20th and 21st centuries, do you believe the
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.680]   United States can ever begin to stop our dependency on debt?
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.480]   If you believe we should, what are some ideas you might have to help balance our budget
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.780]   and begin reducing our debt?
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.200]   If any single person could help solve this, I believe you might have some good ideas on
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.160]   this.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.600]   Look, I am not a financial genius.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.880]   I have never been a financial genius, and I have no aspirations to being a financial
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.880]   genius.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:12.320]   Does that make that clear?
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:18.700]   With that, let me say a couple of things.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:27.180]   First, we've struggled to pull ourselves out of this ghastly mess from 2008, 2009, almost
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:34.100]   failure of our financial system, almost entirely by monetary policy, Federal Reserve.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.880]   We have done nothing in fiscal policy.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.180]   We could have raised taxes to help or cut taxes to help, and we have done neither in
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.180]   any material way.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:50.540]   There have been a few tax increases, I think, in that period, not enough to hold the balance.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:54.720]   We're going to have to have -- every economist is going to tell you, at least they told me
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:03.580]   this in 1949, that the best way to deal with crises is to have fiscal and monetary policy
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.580]   work together.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.140]   We have not done that here.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.260]   How do we get out of it?
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.260]   How do we start to cut that debt down?
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:17.540]   Well, first, a massive, say, tax increase, huge tax increase to start running at surpluses
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.820]   would be an economic disaster for the country.
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:27.020]   The way it's going to have to work is if we continue to get growth, and I think we might
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:34.580]   be lucky enough to get 2.5% or 3% growth in GDP, we can work the ratio of debt to GDP
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:39.860]   down just by not letting the debt grow, and if the GDP grows and the debt doesn't grow,
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:44.180]   just by holding it steady, you won't do a lot of damage to the economy, and the ratio
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.900]   will gradually come down.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:54.100]   It is large, and I would say historically alarming, but I think in today's circumstances,
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:58.860]   it's something that you have to be conscious of taking it down by maybe some combination
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:06.340]   of rising taxes, although the demands of our budget, all these things about having college
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.380]   free for students and helping the people that need help in our country of whom there are
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:17.100]   many and who deserve help, who we must have, we must help, we're going to have some kind
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:21.820]   of a revolution around here, which is the last thing anybody wants, to balance all these
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:28.620]   things in a federal budget in an affirmative, quickly changing, sharply changed dynamic
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:31.660]   is simply not going to happen.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:36.340]   The Federal Reserve has balance sheets, I think it's $6 trillion or something, never
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:40.420]   anything like that before, how is that going to come down?
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:47.580]   I don't know the answer to that question, and how do we have in a political system that
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:53.260]   we are almost stymied every time we do something in government, nothing much happens down there,
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:57.540]   how are we ever going to do even the small things I'm talking about, a more intelligent
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:02.180]   tax system that can raise a little more taxes, enough to pay for the things we have to spend
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.980]   money on, or that I believe we have to spend money on, and it's a conundrum, but there
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:15.100]   are answers statistically, but what will actually work, what you can actually implement is really
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:21.660]   a problem, because we don't implement very much, nor do we have much of a consensus.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:26.540]   We have two Republican parties at the moment, and probably two Democratic parties, it looks
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:32.060]   like that from the primaries anyway, and it may even get worse, so we have a lot to answer
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.980]   as Americans.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:39.360]   They say we get the government we deserve, and I think that's accurate, we being broadly
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.620]   defined as everybody, but I constantly remind people, I was chairman of our Constitution
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:49.940]   Center then in Philadelphia when it was being built, and everybody used to say democracy,
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:54.900]   I said we are not a democracy, we have never been a democracy, we are a republic, for whom
[00:59:54.900 --> 01:00:01.940]   a republic, for which it stands, that's what we've always been, where the voters elect
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.740]   their most able representatives to represent them.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.900]   We don't, I think we're slipping a lot, you could argue that democracy is responsible
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:15.100]   for what's going on in the Republican party and the Democratic party, almost in the Democratic
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:24.060]   party too, and Brexit, British thing, was basically a plebiscite, where everybody got
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:29.940]   an equal vote, where they had a flying clue as to what leaving the European Union would
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:35.180]   mean to Britain, and obviously most of them didn't, so you get issues about feelings,
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.660]   issues about emotions, issues about who talks the loudest, and get your ear last, and that's
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:47.380]   how you vote, and none of that is healthy, so I worry about that, and I don't see clear
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.020]   answers in front of us.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.660]   You could argue we never have seen clear answers about the problems we face, but I think this
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:01:02.220]   nation has always had the strength to finally do what's right, as Churchill said, Americans
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:08.220]   always do what's right, but only after they've tried everything else.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:15.860]   Jack, this is an area I think you've mentioned many times before, but not necessarily to
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.860]   this crowd.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.940]   It says, "Hello Mr. Bogle, I've learned so much from you, your teachings, your experience
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:27.540]   via interviews and writings, I invest only in total stock market, and automatically reinvest
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.900]   all dividends and capital gains.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:35.460]   My bond investment is totally my government pension, and social security benefits.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.760]   I don't think I need a bond portfolio.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.060]   What is your opinion?"
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:46.900]   Well, in the abstract, she's exactly right, but you can't do anything in the abstract.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:51.100]   You would have to know what the value of her stock portfolio is, relative to the income
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:56.620]   she's earning from her two pensions, social security, and I think you said government
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:06.300]   pension, and so in the abstract, if they're, let me say they're 80% of her wealth, she's
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.780]   absolutely right.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.060]   On the other hand, if they're 10% of her wealth, she should probably have a bond position.
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.260]   I've always thought that you ought to take into account, and I've said this many, many
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:20.740]   times for many, many years, you should always take into account your fixed income side of
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:26.460]   your equation, social security, corporate pension, and bonds, and then stocks on the
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.580]   other side.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:33.840]   It's not easy to do that, statistically, because social security value, you know, the typical
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:40.380]   value of, I think the capitalized value of social security for a typical investor that's
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:45.260]   at retirement is around $300,000, $325,000 a year.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.820]   Make a note of that, Mike, and see if I'm right.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.940]   Is that about right?
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.620]   Well, thank you.
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.140]   You're going to go far in this company.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.620]   We have a yes man.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:03.020]   But that's basically, it's not a bond position because you don't own it, your heirs don't
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:08.220]   get it, it stops when you die, but in terms of your financial stability during the remainder
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:13.860]   of your life, it acts like a bond, and a bond with a cost of living hedge.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.540]   I mean, is there anything better?
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.140]   And probably not.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.140]   Maybe it's too good a deal.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:23.220]   There are those that say the benefits ought to be cut back.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:29.220]   I saw an idiotic op-ed in a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal saying why
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:36.100]   are we paying all these investors 8% if they wait until 60.5% to 72.5% or whatever it is
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.820]   to get their social security, which I did too, and they didn't seem to have the slightest
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:46.020]   understanding that the reason it's 8% is that these people die off every year and never
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.400]   get a penny.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:54.220]   So actuarially, the 8% is probably not excessive at all, but it looks like it, and I couldn't
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.980]   believe the journal would publish it.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:01.240]   Maybe they don't read these things before they publish them, except mine.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.180]   I had a really nice exchange with the journal, and the guy that runs that column, we have
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:14.340]   kind of a laughing stock together, and so he handled me very well when the dean of Harvard
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:20.780]   Business School said the stock market adds value to the society, and it subtracts value
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.020]   by definition.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.140]   So we had a little interchange, and I wrote a short letter.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:28.260]   Short, and I wanted to write, but I wanted to make sure it got in.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.580]   And if you've got to take on somebody, for God's sake, take on somebody like the dean
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.300]   of the Harvard Business School, right?
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.260]   >> This question is from Lynnette.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:42.260]   She says, "Congratulations on a life well lived.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:46.300]   What is your schedule, and how do you have the energy, passion, and drive to continue
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.700]   to work at your age?"
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:58.260]   >> My schedule is completely out of control, and I have the passion and drive to do it,
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.380]   because I really don't have any alternative.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.140]   I don't know what to say about that.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:07.900]   I think anybody, including my wife, who looks at what I do and the intensity with which
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:12.140]   I work, would think I believe accurately.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:18.420]   I've lost a couple of cylinders in my brain, and that may well be true.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:28.580]   But we're all different, and I love what I'm doing.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:33.420]   I love the people I work with, my little team of Mike and Emily.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:39.380]   I'm happy, very happy, to be totally accepted at Vanguard again.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:45.020]   And I love the letters from the shareholder I get every day, even though I spent last
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:50.780]   weekend answering 32 letters while my wife's back was turned.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:57.340]   And she's an unbelievably good human being, and I would be nothing without her.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.340]   She's tolerant.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.340]   She's patient.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.780]   She's a great mother, a great friend to so many people.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:09.340]   And we're very lucky to have a family that's pretty much together, all 31 of us, as I said
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:12.420]   the other day.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:20.340]   So I guess we just honor the expression "press on regardless."
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:25.220]   Sometimes it's hard for me, I'll be honest with you.
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:30.820]   I don't leave home for work until 8 o'clock in the morning, and it's kind of like sloppy
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.820]   duty for me.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:37.900]   But by the time you get to 3 or 3.30 or 4 in the afternoon, I'm too tired to keep going.
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   I'll be honest.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:39.900]   Michael knows this.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.340]   So I go the hell home and take a nap before dinner.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:49.740]   And if I can tell you a little family story, when I get up from my nap, which may last
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:58.940]   over an hour, my wife does not say, "You lazy lout, I need help around here."
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:07.100]   She says, "Did you get enough sleep, dear?"
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:11.700]   Somebody asked me in my -- I was introduced somewhere in my 50th anniversary, the time
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:16.220]   of my 50th wedding anniversary, obviously 10, 15 years ago.
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.700]   And one of the questions from the audience, which are usually quite shameless, there's
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:27.940]   often a shameless question, about the third question that came up was, "What's the secret
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.500]   to being married for 50 years?"
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.980]   And I said, "I never thought about it before."
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:39.980]   And I gave an answer, I've got to tell you, that I couldn't improve on.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:43.660]   Right in a second, I gave an answer that I couldn't possibly improve on.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:54.460]   I said, "Two rules, one, marry a saint, two, never forget the two most important words
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:08:00.960]   in the English language, yes, dear."
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.700]   You can all use that when you get to 50 years.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.820]   It worked, because now I'm at 60.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.180]   >> This question is from Quiet Prosperity.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.380]   We know staying the course is what will give us the best chance of reaching our financial
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:21.700]   goals, but given our emotional makeup as humans, are there any practices, advice you could
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:26.500]   give on how to help fight off the potentially dangerous emotional decisions we are prone
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.500]   to make when the noise gets tuned up or turned up?
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:37.300]   >> Well, I'm subject to all those emotions, too, and I'm not some superhuman human being.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:42.460]   And what I do, when you get a 50% market decline, you really get kind of worried, and you get
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.740]   kind of worried about not so much your own account, because I've got half of it, probably
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:50.900]   a little more than, a fairly safe bond account that's actually going up when the market's
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:54.500]   going down at that time from those interest rate levels.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:59.740]   And so I don't really have a lot to worry about, but I still worry and still get knots
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.100]   in my stomach.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.860]   So what do I do?
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:07.940]   I get out my first book and read it again.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:15.660]   And you reinforce your beliefs, and it's a little hyperbole in that answer, but it's
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.660]   pretty much accurate.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:21.540]   It's really -- it sounds good when I say I get out my first book and read it again, and
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.700]   that was really a book ahead of its time.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:31.900]   Dr. Samuelson said, "John Bogle has changed an industry in the optimal direction, but
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.500]   very few can this be said."
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:39.180]   And this is before the development of indexing or anything else, and there was one smart
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.180]   guy.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.180]   Talk about a genius.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.060]   Paul Samuelson was certainly that.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:48.820]   But it's basically, going back to original principles, what got me to invest in the first
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:49.820]   place.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.820]   What I expected.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.860]   Did anybody warn me the market could go down 25 or 30% or even 50%?
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.740]   You know, it's going to go down, typically.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:01.380]   We don't know any of this, but it's a useful thing to think of.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:08.380]   The market will probably go down 50% every 25 years, once every 25 years, and over 20%,
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:12.020]   probably six times in every 25 years or eight times.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.720]   So when it happens, you say, "Well, there's one.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.940]   Only five to go," or something.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:20.740]   Or that's the sixth time, that's the last one.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.700]   It doesn't work that way, but it's just going back to first principles and trying to figure
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.580]   out why you're investing, what you're doing, and are you doing it the best way you can.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:30.580]   Have you been safe enough?
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.940]   Have you gotten your fair share of market returns?
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:40.860]   These basic principles are so idiotically simple that one wonders, how could it have
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:48.980]   taken 80 years, roughly, no, 75 years, I guess, for somebody to start a mutual fund?
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:51.460]   How could that have happened?
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:57.900]   How could it take until 1975 for someone to figure out that indexing works?
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.900]   It seems inconceivable.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:03.220]   I must be the stupidest guy in the world, because I should have thought about it years
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:07.260]   before, and someone should have thought about it years before that.
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:13.740]   It's all so simple, and I do think that is the way, and that it's proving to be the way,
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:19.780]   and whether the market goes way up or way down, I don't think there are doubts about
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.780]   the value of indexing.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:25.300]   Maybe the value of equities is another question, but the value of indexing to get your fair
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:31.500]   share of the stock market returns is eternal, and it will continue to change this industry,
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.100]   and it will continue to destroy this industry as we know it.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.000]   I'm a disrupter in the hell of it.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.300]   Don't you think that it would be good to remind people, especially the people who are still
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:47.660]   working and have the 401(k)s, that they're buying low instead of bailing out, that this
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:51.700]   is a good opportunity for them, because their money's going in on a regular basis?
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.700]   Sure.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:56.780]   There's no question about this, that people seem to like it when they put their money
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:01.140]   to work at ever-ascending prices and hate it when they're putting their money to work
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.820]   at ever-descending prices.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.680]   Well, that's so backward.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.260]   You should be hoping exactly the opposite.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.620]   The problem with that, I mean, the syllogism is almost exactly correct, but the problem
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:22.620]   is that probably, let me guess, that 35% or 40% of Vanguard shareholders are accumulating
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:28.100]   -- maybe 60% or not, I don't know the exact number, maybe it's 65% -- have done all the
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.900]   investing they're going to do.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:37.300]   So it's always hard to speak to the 35%, let's say, when the 65% is hurting.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.300]   So your point is well taken.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:45.900]   Low prices -- you go to the grocery store, and all the prices are down 50%, you're going
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.620]   to buy everything you can get your hands on.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.580]   So this is a two-part question from Long Invest.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:58.180]   It says, "I have two questions for you about good enough.
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:02.700]   My first question is about good enough portfolio.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.940]   Is there anything wrong with investing in the three-fund portfolio recommended by Taylor
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:13.100]   Larimore, composed of total US stock, total international, and total bonds, without ever
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:18.580]   adding other mutual funds to it all lifelong, regardless of age and market conditions?"
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.980]   I mean, I'm not so sure.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:26.380]   A lot depends on what you mean by how much you have in the non-US portfolio, and to each
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.560]   his own on that.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.860]   And you could say the same thing about a two-fund portfolio, half bonds, half stocks.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:39.820]   You can say it about a one-fund portfolio, the balanced index fund, 60/40, rebalanced
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:43.840]   every day, never more than 60, never less.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.220]   So these are equally good options.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:56.700]   But with the three-fund portfolio, I don't mean to stake my name and reputation on not
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.940]   thinking international is the greatest idea.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:02.820]   But if you think about it, the way the markets are, they equalize.
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.780]   They're a medium for arbitraging the present and the future.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:10.060]   I don't see any reason international stocks will do that badly.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:12.340]   I just don't see a high superiority for them.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:17.340]   It's not so much negative as it's just not a rousing positive.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:20.700]   And I think, Mel, what I'll do, because I don't want to run over my time, but I just
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.700]   have a couple of final words.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:22.700]   Would it be okay if I said them?
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.700]   Is that okay?
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.700]   Sure.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:34.220]   Well, first of all, thank you all so much for coming.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:39.540]   It's been such a delight for me to see all of you, to shake hands.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:46.060]   I don't see how 220 people can take 2,000 pictures, but I guess it's possible.
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:53.540]   And the one thing I finally steeled myself to is you're not wasting any film, which is
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:56.460]   something I worried about, because I'm a well-known cheapskate.
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.580]   But it's been great to be with you.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:07.620]   And as I mentioned, I think, before, and certainly to many of you, this is a happy time in my
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.620]   life.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:16.180]   What can you say about the 65th anniversary in the fund industry?
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:22.060]   What can you say about the 40th anniversary of one of the most creative ideas, stupidly
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:27.820]   simple as it is, in the industry's history, or maybe in finance history?
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.900]   What can you say about the 60th wedding anniversary?
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:38.140]   And for that matter, what can you say about the 15th anniversary of the bubbleheads?
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.260]   You mean a lot to me.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:45.580]   You always have, always will, your kindness and your generosity.
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:50.540]   And I'm a little embarrassed about being overrated, because I am just who I am.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.380]   And I'm happy with who I am.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.500]   I don't think I've found any way to improve myself.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.420]   The old pump is working away.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.500]   The back's not doing so good.
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:06.660]   But so what?
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:20.980]   I think what we have here is a wonderful group, Taylor, Mel, Laura, the other leaders, other
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.260]   Mel, did a nice job the other day.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:28.620]   And all of you together make a huge difference in the organization of this, which Mel has
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:33.340]   done such a great job at, and his associates, I know he says he got a lot of people working
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.340]   on this.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:40.980]   So this makes this a very nice way to celebrate as we come to the end of another year.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:48.020]   I think what we have here is the magic of funds that are designed to serve investors
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:54.940]   with a fortuitous meeting of an investment organization, investment website designed
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:57.940]   to serve other investors, too.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:03.140]   And when you come to the end of the line, it's, I think, service to others, the most
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.340]   important things in your life.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:15.780]   I will quote here William Penn who said, "Whatever good you have to do, do it now, for we shall
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.180]   not pass this way again."
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:21.840]   But I hope to pass this way again a year hence.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:22.840]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:23.840]   Thank you, Jack.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.840]   Thank you.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.840]   Thank you.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.840]   Thank you.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.840]   And you're wasting valuable time.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.840]   Thank you all so much.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.840]   Please be seated.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.840]   Jack, every year, it's tougher and tougher to try to find a memento to give you.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840]   I know your den is full.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.840]   I know you've been through a lot.
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:33.840]   I know you've been through a lot.

[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.840]   I know you've been through a lot.

[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.840]   Jack, thank you again.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840]   Thank you very much.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.840]   That's a wonderful momentum.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.840]   You shouldn't have done it, but you did it, and I thank you.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840]   Thank you so much again, Jack.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.840]   We hope to see you again next year.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:35.840]   Thank you, Jack.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   Thank you, Jack.
