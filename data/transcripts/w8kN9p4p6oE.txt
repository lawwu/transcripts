[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Well, some of us will get lesser rewards in heaven, and others will get more rewards
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.640]   in heaven.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.880]   So why this discrepancy?
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.520]   And won't this disparity cause eternal remorse in some, and some level of strain and tension
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.160]   among all of us?
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.840]   Today's question comes from a listener named Alex, who lives in Germany.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.080]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.860]   You've talked about rewards in heaven in one of your answers to a listener's question.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.960]   Question number 417, is God more happy with other Christians than me?
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.440]   There you mention that God rewards faithfulness, not fruitfulness.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.240]   Does this mean that we may not be rewarded to a degree we could have been, depending
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.920]   on our faith on earth?
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.880]   This question has been plaguing me since I listened to that episode.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.080]   Would that not mean that God shows bias towards those with greater faith?
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.720]   I am grieved because I am unlikely to live up to the reward God may have planned for
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.280]   me and forever will be called a lesser to those with greater faith.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.840]   Those thoughts feel poisonous to me.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.880]   Is it only my envy and pride speaking, or is this something to be concerned about?"
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.080]   Pastor John, what would you say to Alex?
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.440]   About 10 years ago, I recorded a section from Jonathan Edwards' sermon on Romans 2.10,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:29.200]   which I think is one of the most beautiful, mind-expanding, heaven-displaying, Scripture-opening,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.680]   hope-awakening passages that I've ever read anywhere outside the Bible.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   Wow.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.040]   So, I want to do that again here and give it fresh exposure.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.360]   This comes from Volume 2 of the works of Edwards published by Banner of Truth.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.320]   I wasn't able to find it in the Yale works, so if it's there, maybe Tony can point you
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.800]   to it, but I looked for it today and I couldn't find it.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.720]   The reason I think this may be a helpful response to Alex is because he says—I think this
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.640]   is the key sentence—"I feel grieved that I am unlikely to live up to the reward God
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:27.080]   may have planned for me and forever be called a lesser compared to those with greater faith.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.840]   Those thoughts feel poisonous to me."
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.040]   Okay, that's what I want to change.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.640]   I want a remedy, because I think there really are distinctions in reward in heaven, and
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   they're not poisonous, and we're not going to feel envious or resentful.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.680]   What this quotation from Edwards does is describe heaven with real differences between the saints,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.520]   among the saints, because of real differences in holiness here, and yet a community of love
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.080]   in which those differences not only do not produce envy and regret, but actually function
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.560]   to produce the greatest happiness for the community as a whole.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.280]   Edwards has just made a lengthy argument before this text I'm going to read.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.080]   He's just made a lengthy argument that the New Testament teaches, and I think he's right
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.040]   here, that there will be different rewards for different Christians, and if that sounds
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.000]   questionable, I encourage you to read the whole sermon.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's free online.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.480]   I just typed into Google a few minutes ago, "Jonathan Edwards' Sermon on Romans 2.10."
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.720]   That's what I typed into the Google search line, and bang, it was the first thing that
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.760]   came up, free online, right there in front of me.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   Now, here's the passage.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.240]   I'll read it to you.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.320]   So get ready.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.680]   This sounds really different than anything you've ever heard, I predict.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.160]   Christ tells us that he who gives a cup of cold water to a disciple in the name of a
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.800]   disciple shall in no wise lose his reward.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.720]   But this could not be true if a person should have no greater reward for doing many good
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.600]   works than if he did but few.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.880]   It will be no dampening to the happiness of those who have lower degrees of happiness
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.320]   and glory that there are others advanced in glory above them.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.920]   For all shall be perfectly happy, everyone shall be perfectly satisfied, every vessel
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.720]   that is cast into the ocean of happiness is full, though there are some vessels far larger
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.680]   than others.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.920]   And there shall be no such thing as envy in heaven, but perfect love shall reign through
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.320]   the whole society.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.760]   Those who are not so high in glory as others will not envy those that are higher, but they
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.880]   will have so great and strong and pure a love to them that they will rejoice in their superior
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.160]   happiness.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:20.180]   Their love to them will be such that they will rejoice that they are happier than themselves,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.600]   so that instead of having a dampening effect on their own happiness, it will add to it.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:36.960]   They will see it to be fitting that the ones who have been most eminent in works of righteousness
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.560]   should be most highly exalted in glory, and they will rejoice in having that done that
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.080]   is fittest to be done.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.660]   There will be a perfect harmony in that society.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:00.400]   Those that are most happy will also be most holy, and all will be perfectly holy and perfectly
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.540]   happy.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:10.220]   But yet there will be different degrees of both holiness and happiness according to the
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:17.540]   measure of each one's capacity, and therefore those that are lowest in glory will have the
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.380]   greatest love to those that are highest in happiness because they will see most of the
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:30.060]   image of God in them, and having the greatest love to them, they will rejoice to see them
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.100]   the most happy and the highest in glory.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:40.860]   And so, on the other hand, those that are highest in glory, as they will be most lovely,
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.680]   so they will be fullest of love.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.180]   As they will excel in happiness, they will proportionally excel in divine benevolence
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.020]   and love to others and will have more love to God and to the saints than those that are
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.440]   lower in holiness and happiness.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:07.500]   And besides, those that will excel in glory will also excel in humility.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.700]   Here in this world, those that are above others are the objects of envy because others conceive
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.620]   of them as being lifted up with it.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.080]   But in heaven, it will not be so.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.420]   But those saints in heaven who excel in happiness will also excel in holiness and consequently
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.460]   in humility.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.220]   The saints in heaven are more humble than the saints on earth.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.640]   And still, the higher we go among them, the greater humility there is.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:46.120]   The highest orders of saints who know the most of God see most the distinction between
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:55.180]   God and themselves and consequently are comparatively least in their own eyes and are so most humble.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:03.700]   The exaltation of some in heaven above the rest will be so far from diminishing the perfect
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:12.180]   happiness and joy of the rest who are inferior that they will be the happier for it.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:20.500]   Such will be the union of their society that they will be partakers of each other's happiness.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:28.140]   Heaven will be fulfilled in its perfection, that which is declared in 1 Corinthians 12:22,
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:35.820]   if one of the members be honored, all the members rejoice with it.
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:45.700]   So, my encouragement to Alex is that you read the whole sermon, meditate on God's infinitely
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:56.300]   wise and loving ability to make you perfectly happy and perfectly holy in an age to come,
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:03.100]   even though some saints will be more and some less rewarded than you.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.620]   It will be a perfectly happy world.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.820]   What a gem of an excerpt.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.460]   Thank you, Pastor John, for finding that and reading it for us.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.420]   And you're right, this sermon is in the Banner of Truth two-volume edition of the works of
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.420]   Jonathan Edwards.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.500]   It's in volume two, pages 888 to 905.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.180]   But you're also right, it's not in the Yale editions of the printed works and it's not
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.220]   even in the free Yale archive online.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.820]   Seems a little bit odd to me, but it is available online.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.420]   Just Google, just Google search what Pastor John used, Jonathan Edwards' sermon on Romans
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.460]   210, and you should find it fairly easily.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.860]   Thanks for making the Ask Pastor John podcast part of your day.

[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:15.980]   It seems the Apostle Paul traveled at least 15,500 miles in his ministry and around 8,700
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.260]   of those miles were on foot.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.580]   Incredible range for the first century.
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.820]   And we can Google map all those travels, but what can we learn from his travels for our
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.300]   missionary work today?
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.860]   It's a question next up on Wednesday.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.860]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.260]   We'll see you then.
