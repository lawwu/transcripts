[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   It's really valuable to attempt to read the entire Bible in a given year.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Uh, we talked about that last time.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.920]   Uh, but we also need to go deep in particular passages too, uh, which
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.360]   leads to today's question from Mark in New Brunswick, Canada.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.420]   Dear Pastor John, I've just finished reading your latest book,
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.440]   Reading the Bible Supernaturally.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.600]   And while I found it delightful and challenging in some respects, in other
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.320]   respects, I found it overwhelming.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.040]   Some of the deeper methods you mentioned in the book, like sentence
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.880]   diagramming and arcing, seem to be very time consuming, and I'm wondering
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.240]   how to incorporate some of these into my already very busy life.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.680]   Working as an office professional for over 50 hours per week, plus having a
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.560]   family, uh, plus being involved in various leadership functions within my
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.040]   local church, I wonder about my time constraints and do you ever just read
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.080]   the Bible devotionally without getting into all the sentence diagramming and
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.960]   digging and arcing you mentioned in the book?
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.840]   Is there a more common approach you take in your daily devotional
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.160]   reading each morning?
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.720]   The answer is yes.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680]   Yes, I do read the Bible devotionally like that.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.400]   I think I understand what you mean, like that every day without getting into the
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.880]   actual diagramming and arcing on paper or online, although once you've done enough
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.480]   analyzing of that sort over the decades, it happens fairly automatically in your
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.000]   head.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.440]   And yes, there is a way that I approach the scriptures daily in this more
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.360]   devotional fashion.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.080]   In fact, there's a five minute video over at DesiringGod.org called "Aptat, a
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.600]   Strategy for Daily Bible Reading."
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   I just saw it yesterday, and so it'll be there probably whenever you listen to
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.560]   this, and all you have to do is type into the search "aptat, a strategy for daily
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.040]   Bible reading."
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.000]   So I'm not going to go into those details again here.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   What I think will be more helpful here is to paint a biblical picture that might
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   inspire a kind of radical engagement with the Bible for the purposes of radical
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.600]   living for Christ.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.280]   You know, my goal in writing that book and in everything I've ever done with
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   regard to the Bible, my goal is not to produce a lot of Bible nerds, but a kind
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.480]   of Christian or a kind of Christians who are so deep and unshakable in their
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.200]   convictions about eternal reality that they are not blown over by the winds of
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   trouble and don't simply float mindlessly along conforming to the currents of
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.600]   contemporary culture, but use the Bible to become like oak trees.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.640]   That's one image you might use from Psalm 1, but strong trees planted by
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.120]   streams of water that stand in the winds of adversity and give shade to people and
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.000]   bless people.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.360]   Or another image would be one of my favorites, like not like jellyfish
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.240]   floating in the currents of culture, but like dolphins who cut their own path
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.080]   against the current and actually reach people who are stranded in need.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.920]   Those are my goals, a kind of radical, risk-taking, sacrificial, loving,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.480]   countercultural people who make Christ look magnificent in this world because
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.440]   they find so much joy in him and have broken free from the selfishness that is
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   so endemic to all of us and to this world.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.760]   That kind of Christian living in that kind of crazy, countercultural,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:11.360]   uncomfortable way of serving the glory of Christ is not going to come into being by
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.720]   mere natural, casual, ordinary encounters with the Bible.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.080]   Something radically different has to happen in the presence of the Bible for
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.360]   this person to come into being and to be sustained for 60 or 70 years of
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.880]   spiritual warfare.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.640]   So I'm not looking for a way to say that the pathway into the precious and
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.080]   powerful riches of Christ is an easy pathway.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.880]   I'm not trying to make it easy for anybody.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.480]   It's just not going to do any good if we only take the easy way.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:58.680]   There's a roaring lion, supernatural roaring lion at every turn in this pathway,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.160]   and his aim is to keep you from finding the glories of Christ in the scriptures.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.760]   So here's the picture I want to create, not the picture of the tree standing the
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.040]   winds of adversity and not the picture of the dolphin cutting through the
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.000]   currents of culture.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.840]   I love those pictures, but here's the biblical picture that I want to create
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.240]   to inspire.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.320]   Proverbs 2, 3 to 6, "My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.760]   commandments with you, making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.480]   heart to understanding, yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.640]   understanding," and here it comes, "if you seek it like silver and search for it
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.560]   as for hidden treasures, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   the knowledge of God."
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.040]   Or Psalm 19.10, "More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold."
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:03.200]   Or Psalm 119.72, "The law of the Lord is better than thousands of gold and silver
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.920]   pieces." Or verse 127, "Your commandments are above gold, above fine gold."
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   So here's the picture.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.000]   Suppose you discovered that 1,000 years ago, your backyard was a burial ground for
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.760]   the greatest treasures of that bygone world.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.400]   Huge chests of gold and silver are very likely buried not too far beneath the
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.520]   surface in your backyard, and your city has laws on the books that says anything
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.760]   discovered in property that you own is your property.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.040]   And after a week's little poking around and exploration, you had begun to find
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.200]   incredibly valuable treasures, treasures that could put all your kids through
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.000]   college and treasures that could get you out of debt and treasures that could make
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.400]   you a benefactor of a hundred worthy causes, treasures worth hundreds and
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.000]   hundreds of thousands of dollars like gold and fine gold.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.920]   Would you say, "Well, I'm busy.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.800]   Got a lot to do.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   I doubt it."
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.040]   It really does come down to a matter of how desperate we are to get rich with true
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.640]   riches, the riches of Christ and the wealth of his glory and his wisdom and his
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.360]   power for living the kind of radical Christian life this world so desperately
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.600]   needs.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.520]   So my very practical suggestion is this.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.480]   Find a slot.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.480]   I'm just talking one now, not seven.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.680]   Find a slot in your week, perhaps Saturday morning early before you have to do a lot
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.080]   of stuff with the kids or work in the yard, Saturday morning early or Sunday
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:51.960]   afternoon or Sunday evening on the Lord's Day where you do once a week some serious
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.400]   digging in God's backyard.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   But then on most mornings, you just give yourself to a more devotional kind of
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.600]   meditation on the word.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.840]   It's never the one or the other, never.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.520]   It's always both and in proportion to our gifts and the situation we have in life and
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:19.560]   the burden and calling we feel by the Holy Spirit to be a strong, uncompromising,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.760]   compassionate, persevering, sacrificial, risk-taking, loving kind of Christian
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.440]   requires two kinds of encounter with the gold and the silver of God's word.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   One kind of encounter involves sweat, dirty hands, aching back from all the
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.880]   digging in the backyard.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:45.240]   And the other kind, just as important, is more tender when you're holding the gold
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:52.120]   piece and wiping it off carefully, blowing the dirt off of it, and finding it to be a
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.160]   thousand years old and worth thousands of dollars.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.360]   And you're lifting it up to the light and you're tilting it back and forth and you're
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.480]   saying, "Wow, amazing, beautiful, glorious, awesome."
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.200]   And your heart is feeling zeal and joy and contentment and eagerness over the beauty
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.240]   of this gold you just found.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:19.120]   That meditative, affectionate, tender moment is just as important as all the
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.320]   backyard digging.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.880]   Both of these are utterly important.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:33.080]   And Mark, I will pray with you and all of us that God will show you, show me the kind
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:41.120]   of combined tough study and tender cherishing that we're going to need to be
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.440]   the kind of Christians that this world so badly needs.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.160]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.720]   Thank you, Pastor John, for helping us carve out time to study Scripture in depth in the
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.880]   midst of the bustle of daily living.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.520]   I really appreciate that perspective and for the way you explain Bible study in its
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.360]   preciousness and what it should be to us.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.040]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast part of your week.
