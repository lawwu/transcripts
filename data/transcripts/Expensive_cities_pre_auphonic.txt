[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.120]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sidney from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.720]   And in this episode, we want to talk about how the most expensive cities in America could
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.840]   actually be the cheapest.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.720]   And frankly, the most expensive cities in the world could actually be the cheapest in
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.720]   the world.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960]   So, what the heck are we talking about?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.080]   Well, Zillow came out with an interesting study that highlighted the top 50 cities in
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.100]   America and how much money you need to make to afford the "typical" house.
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.440]   We'll say typical house is the median house price.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.560]   And at number one, at number one, can you all guess what city that is?
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.800]   Do you know, Sidney?
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.680]   I know because I saw the chart, but if I hadn't peeked at it yet, my guess would be New York
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680]   City.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   That would be my first guess.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.680]   Right.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.000]   So, argh, you are wrong.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.600]   New York City is not the metro or the city that requires the highest income.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040]   New York City comes in at one, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.040]   Number six on the list of 50 requiring an income of $213,615.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.800]   Number one on the list out of all the 50 is San Jose, California.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.120]   What do you think about that?
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   I would not have guessed that.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   I know the Bay Area is expensive, but I would have picked San Francisco above San Jose.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.640]   I was quite shocked to see such a difference in the pricing.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.440]   Well, San Jose, you know, the Bay Area, it's home to Cupertino, Apple, Netflix, Meta, YouTube,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   Google.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.840]   So, San Jose, yes, I can see how it's expensive, but I've always thought San Jose and San Francisco
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.680]   were almost like neck and neck, you know, plus or minus $20,000 in terms of income required
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   to afford the typical home price.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.160]   And just to recap, Zillow's analysis assumes only a 10% down payment, and it uses the "Zillow
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.240]   Home Value Index" to account for each market's "typical home price."
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:21.040]   But with San Jose at $454,296, the income required to afford a typical home, that is
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:30.320]   a lot, $454,000, because at number two is San Francisco, our hometown, at only $339,864.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.480]   That's a huge spread.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.200]   That's a huge spread.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.040]   We're talking $126,000 more to live in San Jose, which is about 15 minutes to an hour
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   south of San Francisco.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.720]   That's a lot, and that actually makes me quite happy.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   You know why?
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   Why?
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.600]   Because San Francisco is way better than San Jose, and sorry for folks listening from
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   San Jose.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   But come on now.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.640]   I mean, the reason why San Francisco is an international city and the reason why people
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.400]   come from all over the world to Northern California is to come to San Francisco.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.360]   They don't say, "I got to go to San Jose," right?
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   Let's be honest here.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   I would agree with that.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.960]   And I've been to San Jose many, many, many times before.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.480]   It's warmer.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   It's nice.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   It's clean.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.200]   It's kind of boring if you're in your 20s or 30s.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   What do you think?
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.560]   I haven't spent enough time down there, but just of what I've seen and heard, I would
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.520]   agree with you that San Francisco is a more exciting place to live and hang out.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.940]   So here's an interesting anecdote.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.240]   So our old house finally got tenants, and the four tenants all come from the San Jose,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.960]   Palo Alto, Cupertino area.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.120]   And they're all in their 20s.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.680]   And I asked them, "So why are you all moving up here?"
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.960]   And they said, "Because it's really boring down there, and they want to experience the
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.720]   big city living and life."
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.600]   I think a lot of the big tech companies have seen this as well, which is why a lot of them
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.760]   were opening offices in San Francisco, pre-pandemic at least, because a lot of their employees
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.000]   wanted to stay up in the city.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.800]   So now a lot of, well, our tenants are reverse commuting.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.240]   They're going an hour south by one of those tech buses, and one is going to Stanford University
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.600]   for her PhD.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   And so, yeah, the proof is in the pudding.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   We've literally got tenants who are doing this reverse commute.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.840]   And so a lot of people have made fun of my post in the past called, "Why Households Need
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   to Earn $300,000 a Year to Live a Middle-Class Lifestyle in an Expensive City."
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.560]   If you look over at that post, you'll see tons and tons of comments saying how I'm out
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.800]   of touch with reality, I don't know what I'm talking about, how their reality is more real
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.440]   than my reality.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.200]   So guess what, folks?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.320]   It's really nice to see some external validation from Zillow and other think tanks out there
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.600]   saying, "Hey, well, San Francisco, $339,864 to afford a typical home, and I've been saying
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.360]   $300,000, so I think the numbers are justified."
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.800]   Do you find that number shocking, $339,000 in San Francisco city?
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.200]   I don't find it that shocking just because, I mean, I felt that the city has been expensive
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.760]   for a very, very long time.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.000]   The biggest shock to me was what you've already mentioned, that San Jose came in first at
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.880]   such a huge spread above San Francisco.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.720]   Yeah, and here's an interesting thing, because before San Francisco, I was living in Manhattan,
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   and you got to differentiate between New York City and Manhattan, because Manhattan is like
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   30 to 50% more expensive than San Francisco.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.560]   New York, again, it's only number six on the list.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.680]   Let me just read the top 10 cities and the income required.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:11.640]   So San Jose, $454,000, San Francisco, $339,000, Los Angeles at number three, $279,000, San
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:22.680]   Diego, $273,000, Seattle, $213,000, New York, $213,000, Boston, $205,000, Riverside, California,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.040]   $173,000, and then Denver, Colorado, $172,000.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.120]   Oh, and then surprisingly, Sacramento, $172,000, followed by Washington, D.C., at $166,000.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   So click over to the post.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.500]   You can see the chart.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.200]   It shows the top 50 city metro areas.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.880]   And actually, the other surprise is Sacramento, rounding up, what, number 10 or so at $172,000,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:54.000]   because for folks who live in San Francisco and San Jose, Sacramento is dirt cheap in
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.680]   comparison.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.520]   So what are some of the things these cities have in common, besides requiring a high income
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.880]   to afford a typical home?
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.460]   What I see is weather.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:15.840]   Weather looks much nicer in the majority of the cities, except for maybe New York, Boston.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.680]   Sacramento gets really, really hot during the summer, and then Washington, D.C.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.760]   Any kind of commonalities you see, Sydney?
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   Nothing comes to mind.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.240]   I agree with what you've said so far.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.080]   Well, here's another commonality.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.920]   The majority of these cities are all on the West Coast, and I have made an argument in
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:39.440]   the past to the gurr of people on the East Coast that the West Coast is a better lifestyle
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   to live than the East Coast.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.040]   Now, I know, come on, y'all on the East Coast are like, "Come on, give me a break, West
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   Coast.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040]   It's terrible.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   It's crappy."
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.520]   But I've lived on the East Coast for 10 years.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.360]   New York City and Virginia, Northern Virginia.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.980]   And then I've lived in San Francisco since 2001.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:05.920]   So I have a pretty balanced outlook here, and I feel that once I was able to go snowboarding
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.120]   in like two feet of powder on a Saturday and come back and play tennis with my shirt off
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.200]   in 70-degree weather on a Sunday, I was sold.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.360]   And I felt that being able to enjoy the outdoors, the quality of life year-round, 12 months
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.960]   a year, was valuable, and as I get older, and time has become more precious because
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:32.280]   I have less of it, being able to spend 12 months outdoors and enjoy the city is more
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.000]   worthwhile than, let's say, sacrificing three to four months of really, really cold winters
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   or extremely hot and muggy summers.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.880]   You know, Chicago.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.640]   Chicago is one of the best value cities in America.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.880]   It's a huge city, and it is cheaper.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.640]   It requires a lower income to afford a typical home than the national medium of $106,000.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.760]   So in Chicago, you only need $104,000.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.800]   That's pretty good because there's a lot of opportunity in Chicago, but I just can't
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.300]   do the three months of really cold winter.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:17.040]   So what are your thoughts on weather, Sydney, and how much of an impact it has on quality
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040]   of life?
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.720]   Well, I think weather does have a significant impact because if you look at the quality
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   of life in places that are sunny, where people want to be outdoors, lifestyle is generally
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.040]   more balanced and people are happier.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.920]   Yeah, there's an interesting study about what makes people happy, and there are three
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.720]   components.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.920]   One was the weather, warmer weather, right?
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.520]   Two was friends and family, and three is just more activity.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.640]   So if you combine those three items, you know, places like California, several cities in
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   California, Denver, Colorado is also really nice.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.240]   However, it gets really, really dry in Denver and Colorado Springs sometimes, and the cost
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.040]   of living in Denver is also quite high.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:12.560]   It's about, looks like it requires $172,000 in income to afford the typical home.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.840]   But weather is a big one, which is why I regret not moving to Honolulu, Hawaii pre-pandemic.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.660]   We have been looking at homes in the area three consecutive years.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:29.680]   You remember all those open houses we saw one or two blocks away from the beach, and
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.320]   they were awesome.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.040]   They were truly awesome.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.760]   And since we left, well, my day job in 2012 and your day job in 2015, we've been thinking
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.600]   about relocating to Hawaii, but why do you think we never moved?
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.240]   And do you have regrets that we did not move?
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.600]   I don't have regrets about it.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:52.120]   I think moving has its challenges, and I think we were happy with our life here.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:58.360]   We have, you know, networks established here, and I feel like we enjoy our freedom here
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360]   as well.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:07.240]   We are close enough to our parents, for example, we're not so close that we get bombarded with
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.880]   too much family stress, to be frank.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.240]   I think that's one thought that we had.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   Out of curiosity, does Honolulu show up on your list from Zillow?
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.240]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.000]   I was looking for Honolulu, and it doesn't show up on the list.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.160]   So obviously, that's a huge oversight by Zillow.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.240]   But if it did show up on the list, I would put the required income to afford a typical
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.600]   home in Hawaii.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.920]   The median home price depends on who you ask.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.280]   Zillow, it's like $780,000.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:42.080]   According to another report, it's about $1.1 million, which sounds more about right based
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.680]   on all the homes that we've been looking at, and not just our homes.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.160]   I mean, I'm talking to realtors locally on the ground and seeing what's out there.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:59.920]   I would say it requires about $250,000 plus to afford a typical home in Honolulu, Hawaii,
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.840]   and raise a family of up to four, so two kids, relatively comfortably.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.720]   So yeah, okay, folks in Honolulu, don't bash me.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:17.560]   But we're looking basically objectively at the cost of homes, and mortgage rates, and
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.760]   the cost of living, and anybody who's been to Honolulu knows that it's expensive.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.320]   But Honolulu is less expensive than San Francisco.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.720]   Homes are about, similar homes are about 30% less expensive, or you get about 30% more
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.520]   home.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.200]   So relocating to Honolulu, Hawaii would have saved us money.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.480]   Isn't that funny?
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:47.240]   And so I do have regret not moving before the pandemic, because I heard Hawaii was amazing
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:53.280]   during the pandemic, because flights were really not allowed in, or people were encouraged
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.120]   not to come unless it was for like an emergency, right?
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.320]   So you'd have the islands to yourself, the beaches to yourself, less crowds, less traffic.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.080]   But of course, the problem with Honolulu is that the number one industry in Hawaii is
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080]   tourism.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.280]   So when you cut off visitors to Hawaii, then you cut off income, and it makes it much more
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.520]   difficult for businesses to make a profit and pay their employees.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:26.080]   So I do have regrets because the time to move to Hawaii was during the pandemic, and we
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.760]   just couldn't do it because we had our baby daughter, and we weren't about to move and
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.640]   change doctors and change environments after having a baby.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:45.040]   And now that we have moved within San Francisco, do you see yourself staying here for another
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   10 years?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   See us all staying here?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.960]   Well, we better, because I definitely don't want to be moving for a while after we spent
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.460]   so much money on this house.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.120]   Ha ha ha, I have you recorded saying that now.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.200]   I will put this in my files.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:08.040]   Well, I guarantee you that I don't want to move, and I'm going to do my darndest not
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.800]   to move for at least eight years.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:18.080]   And eight years, why that is because that's when our son will be 14, 14 and a half, and
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.760]   be eligible for the ninth grade.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.520]   And his current school only goes through the eighth grade, so we have to reapply for high
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.680]   school.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.880]   And so when we reapply for high school, I think that is the time when we apply to schools
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.800]   in Honolulu, Hawaii, because God willing, I hope my parents will still be around.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:43.400]   And I think that's a perfect time, because I'll be in my 50s, right, ooh, 53, and you'll
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.160]   have just turned 50, so we're getting up there.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   And so...
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   I won't be 50.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   What are you talking about?
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   Okay.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   Okay, you'll be...
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160]   38.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.040]   Either way, we're going to get older, and I think it's good to move to states and cities
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.280]   that are matching of your stage in life.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.160]   And so for Honolulu, Hawaii, I think it's a little bit too early to try to make your
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.720]   fortune in your 20s and 30s there, because income is about 30 to 60 to 70% lower compared
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.680]   to the mainland.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:22.200]   But in our 50s, I am pretty sure in our 50s, we're going to enjoy living in Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   What do you think?
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   I think so.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:31.840]   It's obviously a much slower pace of life, and I think by that time, we'll be more welcoming
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.120]   of that, and it'll be a great goal to have.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.880]   And I'm glad it's not so soon after we made this big move.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.320]   I mean, ideally, how long would you like to live in our current house?
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.400]   I wouldn't put a date on it.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.640]   I just don't...
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.160]   I want it to be so far in the future that I don't even have to think about moving.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.440]   Okay, well, eight years is going to come quicker than we think, I think, because every single
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.600]   parent I talk to says, "Wow, the kids grow up quick, days are long, the years are short.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.720]   They're going to be out of the house before you know it."
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.720]   So it might be harder.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.000]   It still might be harder to move than we realize, because we will have even deeper roots here.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   But who knows?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   We'll see.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   We'll see.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.680]   I guess at the very least, what we're going to do once our daughter is five, when she's
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.160]   really strong enough and sleeping well and can hold all of her memories or most of her
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.880]   memories is that we just spend one or two or three months in Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.400]   We do the summer camps there.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.600]   I'm sure there's cool summer camps like boogie boarding camp or surfing camp or hiking camp.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.300]   I mean, how cool would that be?
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.080]   Or learning about Polynesian culture, local Hawaiian culture.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.160]   I mean, that's so important, at least for me, because I'm part Hawaiian.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.480]   So that is a good opportunity to try before you buy.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.240]   And I don't think we have to relocate there.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.080]   But if we love it so much after many, many years of staying there for two, three months
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.200]   a year, I think it makes it easier.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   Right?
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.720]   It's just kind of like moving to our current home.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.000]   We visited this home over 10 times, maybe 15, 20 times, actually probably more than
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.260]   20 times over an 18-month period when we first saw it.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:16.200]   And then so when we finally got here and we finally moved in, it felt like destiny.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.400]   It felt totally fine.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   What do you think?
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   Right, right.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.240]   Yeah, no, I completely agree with that.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:31.960]   And in terms of talking about cities and relocating way down the road, are there any other cities
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.200]   outside of Hawaii that you would consider?
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.520]   You know, I would consider Taipei, Taiwan to get really good at Mandarin.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.080]   I used to live there for four years and it really helped with my Mandarin in terms of
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.240]   accent, in terms of speaking more fluently.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.860]   Language immersion is the best when you're in that country.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.300]   So Taipei, Taiwan is not the prettiest or cleanest city.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.640]   It's kind of chaotic and it's very hot and humid during the summer, but it's also really
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.160]   friendly people and some of the best food in the world.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.520]   So Taipei, Taiwan would probably be number one on my list.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.580]   China, you know, I lived there for six months during college.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.120]   It's probably completely changed since I last been back.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.280]   Well, I was last back probably eight to ten years ago, but I don't have any roots there.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   What about in the US?
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.640]   In the US, I love San Diego.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.680]   San Diego is kind of like Hawaii.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.360]   It's great for if you're 50 plus, slower pace, warmer weather, 68 degrees all year round.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.400]   But if I'm going to do San Diego, I might as well just go to Hawaii.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.480]   I love Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.680]   I've been going back every year for 46 years.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.680]   How about you?
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.620]   Moving within the US is definitely easier for me to think about than moving abroad.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:58.020]   But I do like the idea of utilizing our kids' time off during the summer to travel abroad
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.980]   or just to a different part of the US and stay there for a longer duration while we
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.980]   work remotely.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.700]   I think that would be fun.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:13.580]   Something where we get to enjoy a new environment, but still have our home to come back to.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.940]   I like that kind of blend.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.220]   You don't want to permanently relocate somewhere.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.700]   It's harder for me to mentally get over that hurdle.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.220]   Well, I'll make it get over it in the future.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.220]   We'll see.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.220]   We'll see.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.460]   I still have you on record that we're staying here for a long time.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.460]   Eight years.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.460]   Eight years.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.460]   It sounds about right.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.460]   Are you sure you didn't say 10?
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.460]   No.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.460]   I said until high school.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.020]   But going back to actually the original point of this podcast, how expensive cities are
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.980]   actually the cheapest.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.020]   It's all about the opportunities.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.060]   Expensive cities are expensive for a reason.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:59.380]   And that reason is more high-paying jobs, better growth opportunities for your career,
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.900]   and for maybe investment opportunities as well.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.980]   So one of the reasons why I couldn't pull the trigger, I didn't feel like it was right
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:14.780]   to move to Hawaii was because the homes, yeah, are 30% or so cheaper, but that's still a
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.780]   lot of money, right?
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.580]   The median home price in Honolulu now is about $1.1 million.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:23.020]   And for some reason, any home you want to buy seems to always be more than the median
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   home price.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:30.660]   So it's probably more like $2 million or $2.5 million or $3 million home in Hawaii.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.740]   And that's still cheaper than San Francisco by, let's say, 500 grand to a million.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:42.380]   But the problem is, and this is probably simply because I didn't feel we had enough money,
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:48.420]   and that is if we bought a home in Honolulu and we got into financial difficulty, some
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:56.660]   accident, some medical mishap, something wrong, there would be fewer, much fewer opportunities
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:01.340]   to earn income that paid as much as mainland income.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.380]   And so this was pre-pandemic.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:09.020]   Maybe it's easier now because there's more from home opportunities, telecommuting opportunities
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.060]   are more ubiquitous now.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:18.300]   But back then, I just felt, "Oh, the best job I could get might pay like 50 to 60, 70,
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.500]   80 grand, but if you own a very expensive home, that's not going to cut it."
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:29.020]   Whereas here in San Francisco, it's much easier to find full-time work that pays six figures,
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.740]   multiple six figures, or part-time consulting work that pays six figures.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.580]   What are your thoughts on that logic?
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.740]   I can agree with you that big cities tend to have a lot more job opportunities.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.580]   That doesn't mean they're less competitive.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.940]   I would think they're more competitive.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:51.500]   However, you have a greater chance to build larger and deeper networks in areas where
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:57.380]   there's more people, especially if your industry is focused on an area where there's a lot
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.380]   of people.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.460]   The network effects are huge in bigger cities.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.460]   But you're right.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.900]   You're absolutely right on the competition.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:11.940]   I applied to every single tech job I could in 2012, Airbnb, I think Uber was just starting,
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.260]   Google, Facebook, Apple, didn't get anywhere because I just went through the online channels.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.600]   I didn't have any connections, but now I have connections and I feel now I might be able
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.980]   to get a job at one of those places if I wanted one, maybe.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.140]   But the network effect is huge.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.540]   Just for example, next week, Ben Miller, the CEO of Fundrise, he's coming to town to visit
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.540]   San Francisco.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.420]   He's got some business and we're going to go grab a beer.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.420]   That's cool.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.420]   Awesome.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.420]   That builds a relationship.
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.700]   I've been speaking to him for years, but we've never met in person.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.720]   Having these relationships helps in terms of business, in terms of job opportunities,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.620]   consulting opportunities.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:58.900]   I know a lot of people from my days consulting at Personal Capital, now Empower, a lot of
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.740]   VCs, a lot of business CEOs.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.140]   It's really cool to be in a bigger city because of that.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.240]   If you're a normal person, you're a helpful person, you're a thoughtful person, you can
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.780]   gain a lot more opportunities.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.620]   That fear of losing all that and going to Honolulu where I don't have a deep network
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:25.860]   and not being able to earn income to support the expenses, to cover those expenses was
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.660]   pretty difficult.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:33.120]   For those of you thinking about building wealth, focus, I would say, on opportunities in big
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.260]   expensive cities.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.380]   They're expensive for a reason because the income opportunities are more.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.900]   If you want, once you've built your wealth, you can always relocate to a lower cost area
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.100]   of the country.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.120]   You might discover that you might have made enough or so much that you don't really need
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.780]   to move to a lower cost area of the country or the world to save money because the income
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.960]   upside is so much greater.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.240]   That's my main point.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.500]   It's like playing offense to build wealth because income is unlimited, the upside is
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:12.340]   unlimited versus playing defense by saving your way to wealth.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.340]   You can only save so much.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.780]   You can only cut your expenses.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.940]   It's kind of like using 25 times your expenses to say that you're financially independent
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.660]   versus using 20 times your income.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.300]   It's much harder to do 20 times your income, but it also keeps you more honest about saving
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.740]   and investing more money as your income grows versus with expenses, you can just slash it
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:38.560]   to ramen noodle budget prices and you can say, "Oh, I'm financially independent."
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.180]   It's a different way of thinking, but again, I am also biased because my entire post-college
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:50.340]   career has been living in the two most expensive cities in America, New York City and now San
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.700]   Francisco.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.020]   Take my experience for what it is.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.660]   If you're looking for more wealth building opportunities, I would say don't let the cost
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.620]   scare you off.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.620]   Try it out.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.020]   Come to a big expensive city for two, three years.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.780]   See if you can get some opportunities.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.900]   You can gain some momentum, build a network of friends.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.900]   Who knows?
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:16.260]   You might be able to reach critical takeoff and if you don't, you can always go back.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.840]   All right, everybody.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.340]   That's it for this episode regarding living in expensive cities and how they could actually
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:28.100]   be cheaper because you could make a lot more money to afford all the things you want to
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.260]   buy.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:35.500]   It's not like a Honda Accord is going to cost less in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania versus San
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.700]   Francisco, California.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.180]   The pricing is pretty much the same wherever you go in America.
