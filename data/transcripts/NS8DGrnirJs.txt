[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]   [Music]
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.920]   Pastor John, you recently tweeted this,
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.420]   "Serving is the measure of greatness," Matthew 20, 26,
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.720]   "because it takes greater power to conquer selfishness than to command service."
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.420]   Take a moment to explain that tweet for us today.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.720]   What I had in mind was that the normal view of power
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   is that it includes the ability to command somebody, to get your way.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   If somebody has power, they can tell others what to do, and then that serves them.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   And that's what Jesus had in mind. He refers to it in Luke 22,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.220]   and those in authority over them are called benefactors."
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.220]   He knows what the normal, on-the-street meaning of power is,
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.220]   and of course, in one sense, that's true.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.720]   But what makes it not power is that we're just born this way.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   Children are born demanding.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720]   They want mama to do for them right away,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.220]   and we stay like that unless we're converted.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.220]   We're very demanding people. We have a sense of entitlement.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.220]   And so in one sense, it takes as much power to command people as it does to fall off a cliff.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.720]   It's like falling off a log. It doesn't take any effort at all to be selfish and have power in that way.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   So Jesus comes along and he says, "Now whoever would be great among you must be your servant."
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   So he reverses that, and as I look at my own heart, and as I look at the history of the world,
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.220]   it takes a huge power to not act powerfully.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.220]   Proverbs 16, "Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.220]   He who rules his spirit is more powerful than he who takes the city."
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.720]   So the proverb and Jesus are thinking of another kind of power
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   that is power over your selfish love of power that is rare,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   and therefore Jesus wants it to happen for his glory.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:32.220]   I was just readingâ€”no, I was just looking at the trailer of J.I. Packer's new book, "Weakness is the Way,"
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:42.220]   and what struck me about it in this regard is that the subtitle of the book is "Life with Christ, Our Strength."
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.720]   And I think that gets at the key to what Jesus is really after, what's really new with Jesus.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:56.220]   Jesus isn't just resurrecting a proverb and saying, "I'm your new wise man, and I have more proverbs to tell you."
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.720]   He was saying, "I intend to be your strength now.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.220]   I've come to die for your sins, to sever the root of the control of the love of selfishness in your life,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.220]   and to be for you what you thought you had to be for yourself."
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:24.720]   And so when you read commands from Paul, he says things like, "Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might."
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.220]   And I toil, struggling with all the energy that he powerfully works within me.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:49.220]   And the one that I love the most is 1 Peter 4, 11, where Peter says, "Let him who serves serve in the strength that God supplies,
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.220]   so that in everything God will get the glory through Jesus Christ. To him belong the glory."
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.220]   And so when Jesus is calling us to be servants, contrary to the world's way of thinking about power,
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.220]   he means he's going to sever that horrible love of demanding selfish entitlement,
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:20.720]   and he's going to be our portion, and he's going to give us strength so that when we act against those natural inclinations by faith in him,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.220]   he gets the glory, not us.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:33.220]   And so that's what I meant when I said there is a kind of greatness and a kind of power that is much greater than the power to command service.
