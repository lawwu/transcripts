[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.540]   - Welcome to the "Bogleheads Chapter Series."
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.880]   This episode was hosted
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.240]   by the Metro Boston Bogleheads Chapter
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.620]   and recorded April 23rd, 2022.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.080]   It features Chris Pedersen
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.920]   of the Merriman Financial Education Foundation
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.820]   discussing several simple and effective portfolios
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.240]   which offer massive diversification appropriate
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.860]   for both accumulation and retirement stages.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.780]   Bogleheads are investors
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.020]   who follow John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.520]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.860]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.900]   and should not be construed
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.900]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.060]   - We're fortunate enough to have Chris Pedersen
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.580]   from the West Coast with us here today.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.740]   And Chris volunteers
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.040]   at the Merriman Financial Education Foundation,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.420]   a nonprofit run by Paul Merriman
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.940]   with the goal of providing financial education
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.680]   and tools to investors to make informed decisions.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.540]   For several years,
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.980]   I've been listening to the Paul Merriman's podcast
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.380]   and I heard about Chris's research.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.220]   A few months ago,
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.620]   I watched a presentation Chris did in 2020
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.020]   on the topic he's gonna speak about today.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.780]   And I was impressed by the research
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.860]   that Chris and the Merriman Foundation have done
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.460]   and also how Chris can take complicated data analysis
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.400]   and explain it in a clear, concise way.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.580]   Chris, I thought I'd start by asking you a few questions
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.460]   so our audience can get to know more about you.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.580]   - Sounds good.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.980]   - Okay.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.220]   You were an engineer working in Silicon Valley
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.500]   until you retired.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.060]   How did you meet Paul Merriman
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.960]   and how did you get involved with the Merriman Foundation?
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.700]   - Well, I was an engineer in Silicon Valley
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.020]   and I was, you know how you get that kind of spidey sense
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.700]   that maybe a change is coming
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.220]   and maybe retirement is coming.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.940]   I kind of thought that was what was in my near future.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.860]   And I knew that that meant
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.660]   I needed to become a better investor.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.900]   So I started listening to podcasts, reading lots of books.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.160]   And I was like you,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.220]   I was impressed with the work that Paul did.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.040]   He just didn't have any conflict of interest.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.980]   He was motivated by one thing, to help people.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.180]   And so I thought, well, if I could reach out to him,
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.440]   maybe I could volunteer.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.980]   That was something my mom always did.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.020]   She volunteered to work with all kinds of impressive people.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.980]   And to my surprise, Paul said, yes.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.980]   He said, I've got some cool projects,
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.380]   you know, would you want to work?
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.220]   And it was like, great.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.820]   So I started working with him
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.980]   and that gave me access to a huge amount of data
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.520]   and research and perspective and more than anything,
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.900]   the opportunity to try to teach things I was learning
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.060]   because you always learn better when you try to teach.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.500]   So that was how I got started.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.940]   I mean, it was really just a phone call.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.300]   - Okay, great.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.820]   And can you tell us a little bit more
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.340]   as director of research about, you know,
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.200]   the research and the work that you do
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.900]   at the Merriman Foundation?
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.340]   - Yeah, we, you know,
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.660]   we try to essentially become time travelers.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.460]   We have return sequences that go back to anything
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.280]   from the 1990s to about 1928.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   And sometimes there are gaps in those return sequences
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.400]   that we have to fill in.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.700]   So we get, you know, we do the very best we can
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.520]   leveraging all the various data sources
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.940]   we can find to do that.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.940]   And then when we have those return sequences
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.380]   for different asset classes going back into the past,
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.260]   we think about interesting investor questions like,
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.340]   you know, does it make sense to rebalance
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.740]   more or less frequently?
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.780]   Does it make sense to just invest in the S&P 500
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.140]   or diversify more broadly?
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.940]   And we had, up until I joined the organization,
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.500]   all of our work was with fixed allocations,
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.760]   but I wanted to do some work with target date funds,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.860]   which have time varying allocations.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.780]   So a lot of what I do is building back testers
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.540]   that will take a time varying asset allocation
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.900]   across a lifetime and a number of assumptions
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.680]   about how somebody's cash flows look
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.700]   and figure out how it would have performed in the past.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.140]   There's no guarantee the future will be like the past,
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.340]   but we have no way to know what the future would be at all
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.540]   unless we base it on something in the past
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.060]   is the best predictor we've got.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.820]   So it's fun.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.740]   We work with a lot of really interesting questions
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.740]   and we get a lot of interest.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.660]   I'm hoping to get some interesting questions
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.300]   at the end of the presentation today.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.540]   And I learn as much from those as I do
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.420]   from the work I do with Paul.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.380]   - Okay, great.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.180]   Well, now that we know a little bit about you
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.220]   and your background, I'm gonna turn it over to you.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.820]   So go ahead and start.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.580]   - Let me see if we can get this sharing set up right.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:05:00.300]   - One thing, Therese, is that the saving of the chat
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.620]   would be at the end of the presentation.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.220]   If they save it now.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.620]   - Are you seeing the presenter view
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.100]   or are you seeing the presentation?
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.660]   - We're seeing the presentation.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.260]   - Okay. - Excellent, okay.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.140]   So, man, I can't believe it's been two years
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.820]   since I first did this presentation.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.940]   And I hope that this new version can live up
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.220]   to the kind introduction Therese gave me.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.780]   When we did this two years ago,
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.220]   one of the criticisms I got
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.180]   was that our analysis only went back to 1970.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.900]   So today I'm going to be doing some analyses
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.140]   that go back to 1970,
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.540]   but we're gonna extend where we can back to 1928.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.540]   And that'll give us a scarier picture
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.580]   because it includes the great depression,
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.060]   but it'll also give us a more realistic picture
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.820]   because from 1970 until now
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.540]   was a relatively strong market for bonds.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.180]   And by going back to 1928,
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.260]   we'll include the good news, the bad news,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.340]   and everything in between.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.660]   And I think it'll give us more confidence
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.220]   about the conclusions.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.180]   So we're gonna talk about simple and effective
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.660]   balanced lifetime portfolios.
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.900]   And before we get started,
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.540]   because I'm talking to bogleheads,
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.980]   I have to mention the three best pieces of advice
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.500]   that I remember hearing Jack advocate.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.660]   One was buy right.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.700]   The second one was hold tight.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.340]   And the third was don't peak.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.420]   And I think in many respects,
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.580]   if you had to just give somebody six words,
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.540]   those were a wonderful set of six words for investing.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.860]   The focus of today's presentation
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.620]   is mostly gonna be on buy right.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.460]   And I know that for Jack Bogle,
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.860]   buy right meant the S&P 500 or a total market fund.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.260]   And I really don't have anything against that.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.340]   I think it's fine.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.900]   I think it's great advice.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.380]   And I think for people who aren't willing to learn more
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.780]   about investing and aren't willing to study it a little bit,
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.540]   it's probably the right place to stop.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.300]   And that's probably why Jack stopped there.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.500]   I think if you do have an appetite to learn more though,
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.020]   there are other opportunities
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.140]   for meaningful diversification
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.060]   that at least historically
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.140]   have had really significant advantages.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.300]   So let's talk about what some of those are.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.060]   When we talk about simple balanced portfolios,
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.500]   the reason I'm excited about it
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.540]   is that they give us an ability
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.460]   to control the return risk trade-off that we're gonna get.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.060]   And sometimes even improve the return per unit of risk
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.780]   that we're taking.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.820]   They give us the ability to have higher safe withdrawal rates
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.780]   or higher survival rates sometimes in retirement.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.900]   At least that's what the history says.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.900]   And they're easier to manage than 20 stocks or 50 funds.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.980]   There's a lot of complex ways to get to the same place,
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.300]   but why be complex if you don't need to be?
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.060]   So we'll talk about the simple paths
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.820]   and then we'll talk about the trade-offs
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.180]   that we give up for that simplicity.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.900]   What we'll cover today are first of all,
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.660]   what balanced portfolios are.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.660]   Second of all, what we can do with a few funds
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.060]   in a fixed allocation.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.420]   And then third, what we can do with a few funds
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.420]   in a time varying allocation, like a target date fund.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.140]   And we'll in each case,
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.740]   look at how they differed during accumulation
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.420]   and during retirement,
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.220]   because those are dramatically different phases of life
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.620]   and they have different priorities.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.620]   And finally, we'll talk about what we give up
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.420]   by being simple and hopefully have time
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.660]   for question and answer.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.940]   So balanced, let's just start with the word.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.100]   What does balanced mean?
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.940]   Most of us have ridden a bicycle,
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.100]   so you know about left and right and staying balanced.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.180]   And so one definition is an even distribution of weight,
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.380]   enabling someone or something to remain upright and steady.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.820]   A second definition, which starts to get closer
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.260]   to what we're gonna talk about today,
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.860]   is a condition in which different elements are equal
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.660]   or in the correct proportions.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.020]   And then the third and most specific to investing
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.900]   would be an investment strategy,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.300]   which balances risk and return
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.020]   by combining different assets, such as stocks and bonds.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.140]   And we'll look at all of those,
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.900]   but let's start just to kind of get our minds going.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.540]   Let's start out of category.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.580]   Let's start with something I'm very passionate about,
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.820]   perhaps even more than investing, food.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.260]   So balanced flavors.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.060]   If you were to start thinking about
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.540]   trying to be a great chef,
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.340]   you'd probably have on your mind the idea
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.980]   that you need to balance flavors.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.860]   And you would probably think of the world,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.300]   at least I do, like this.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.420]   There's tens of thousands of ingredients.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   There's tomatoes and chickpeas and onions
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.900]   and steak and cereal.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.860]   How do I balance them all?
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.660]   And the good news is that through science
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.820]   over the course of the last 100 years,
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.020]   chefs have come to realize
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.260]   that there are six underlying key attributes
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260]   and that foods kind of cluster in these key attributes.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.900]   And those are spicy, sour, sweet, salty, umami, and bitter.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.700]   And that some of these attributes balance one another
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.220]   and some of them compliment one another.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.100]   And that you can make fantastically tasty meals
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.020]   by properly selecting among them and combining them.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.700]   And that the best things are usually a combination,
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.900]   not just one note, not just salty, not just sweet.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.460]   Although many of the fast foods we eat are just that.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.540]   But the best foods,
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.660]   the meals that we probably remember the most
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.660]   are usually an artful combination of all of these.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.420]   Well, it turns out you can look at investing
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.460]   much the same way.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.860]   If we look out at the kinds of stocks
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.900]   or companies we could invest in in the world,
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.500]   there are thousands, thousands and thousands of companies
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.820]   and trying to figure out how you would choose among them
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.620]   and why you would choose certain ones over other ones
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.060]   and which ones might compliment one another
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.500]   or which ones might balance one another
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.020]   is a very difficult task.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.300]   But fortunately for us,
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.100]   academics have done an exercise
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.860]   much like the food scientists did
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.180]   and have figured out that there are key attributes
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.780]   both in the fixed income or bond space
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.300]   and in the equity or stock space.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.340]   So in the fixed income or bond space,
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.340]   there are basically two attributes that really matter.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.500]   One is the length of the bond or the term.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.340]   And you can imagine if you are gonna,
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.020]   if you think of the bond as a loan,
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.980]   if somebody is gonna loan you money
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.660]   or you're gonna loan somebody money and buy a bond
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.500]   for one year, you would probably accept a smaller return
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.340]   or interest rate than if you loaned the money for 20 years.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.660]   'Cause who knows what's gonna happen
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.140]   with inflation over 20 years.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.940]   So the longer the term
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.500]   or the longer the duration of the bond,
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.900]   the more you're gonna ask for
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.540]   in terms of a return in interest
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.940]   and you're likely gonna get it.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.100]   Credit's a similar kind of thing.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.780]   If you loan the federal government
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.060]   in the United States money,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.740]   they can print money and give it back to you.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.100]   You're gonna get paid back.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.180]   The money may not be worth quite as much,
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.260]   but they could do that.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.140]   If you loan money to a fly-by-night business
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.580]   that's on the verge of bankruptcy,
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.420]   you're gonna ask extortionist rates and you might get it.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.580]   And so in bonds, these two attributes, term and credit,
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.460]   pretty much define about 98 to 99%
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.740]   of the return experience you're gonna get
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.220]   in terms of the volatility
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.940]   and the compound annual growth rates.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.940]   In stocks or equities, there are five attributes
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.500]   that the academics have found and generally agree upon.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.940]   The first is market risk.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.700]   And that's the idea that by investing in the stock market,
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.420]   you're going to see the value of your money
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.460]   or your investment go up and down
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.780]   as all kinds of unknowns come to pass.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.500]   Earnings go up and down.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.580]   The economy changes.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.900]   There's geopolitical news.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.780]   And so you're going to expect to be compensated for that.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.940]   And historically, if you invested in the S&P 500
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.460]   or a total market fund, you were.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.940]   You were compensated for that.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.940]   You got a return of between 6% real and 10% nominal.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.860]   So you get a return.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.980]   The second one is size.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.140]   Smaller companies tend to be more volatile.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.140]   So investors tend to expect to and get a higher return
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.380]   out of investing in smaller companies.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.060]   Not always, but they tend to,
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.180]   and particularly higher quality smaller companies.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.740]   And we'll take a look at that in a minute.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.060]   Value is the third characteristic.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.340]   And this basically says that if you buy parts of the market
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.500]   that are out of favor, they're not inflated in price,
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.900]   you're going to have a kind of a buffer,
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.020]   a cushion, if you will, a margin of safety
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.700]   that potentially will deliver you a higher return
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.540]   in the future.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.900]   And historically has delivered a higher return.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.100]   The next two qualities are momentum
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.420]   and the quality attribute or factor.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.380]   And momentum basically says things that have been going up
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.060]   continue to go up until they don't.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.820]   So the trick with momentum is that,
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.740]   although the companies that have been going up
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.620]   tend to continue going up, you have to keep watching them.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.820]   And when they start to go down,
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.340]   if they go down for a certain amount of time,
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.340]   you have to trade out of them.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.740]   So momentum is a more active strategy.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.380]   And then quality says companies that have better financials
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.940]   or better moats to defend against competition do better.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.820]   So this is all kind of airy-fairy and fuzzy,
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.660]   but the key takeaway, if you back up to the 10,000 foot view
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.300]   is that in the same way that there are these attributes
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.660]   that drive a tasty meal,
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.460]   there are a handful of attributes
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.540]   that drive a high performance portfolio.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.780]   And we're going to look at how they have actually done
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.340]   in the past and how they performed.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.460]   But before we do that,
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.620]   let's look briefly at how available they are.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.500]   So if we're looking for market risk,
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.580]   there are literally thousands of US stocks or funds
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.620]   that give us access to market risk.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.140]   And what I've defined as meaningful access
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.660]   is greater than 30% of the premium
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.260]   that the academics have discovered.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.420]   So pretty much every stock fund you could invest in,
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.460]   whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF,
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.980]   is going to give you exposure to the market risk
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.860]   that we just talked about.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.940]   The size risk is available in 1,000 plus funds.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.100]   The value risk is available in about 1,000 funds.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.620]   You can get market size and value risk
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.820]   in about 500 funds in the United States.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.540]   You can get market size value and quality risk
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.700]   in about 300 funds in the United States.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.140]   So these would be called small cap value funds,
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.100]   and they are the original multi-factor fund.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.940]   If you go out and look for multi-factor labeled funds,
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.580]   you won't find that many.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.620]   But if you invested in a small cap value fund
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.300]   that also screens on quality,
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.780]   you're in a multi-factor fund.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.020]   And we'll see why that's important in a little bit.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.260]   If you're looking for funds that deliver meaningful exposure
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.100]   to momentum and quality, they are rare.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.540]   They're hard to come by.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:33.340]   And it's because momentum is a costly attribute
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.820]   to get in the market and involves a lot of trading.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.500]   There's inefficiency associated with that.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.660]   And if you're looking for quality,
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.260]   too much of it's absorbed in these other funds.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.460]   Everybody tries to screen on quality
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.660]   and the quality specific funds, there aren't that many.
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:54.300]   So if we're looking into somebody's kitchen,
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.260]   their 401k, they're trying to cook their portfolio.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.100]   What do they have?
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.940]   What are their ingredients?
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.620]   Well, basically they have two staple ingredients.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.020]   They have stock funds and they have bond funds.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.500]   And almost every 401k or IRA is gonna have access to those.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.860]   And then they have spices
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.580]   and there's a mild spice and a strong spice.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.540]   You could have a large cap value fund.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.900]   Many 401ks do.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.740]   If you're lucky, you'll have a small cap value fund
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.380]   because that's a stronger spice.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.500]   And as we'll see, working with the stronger spice
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.980]   is a better way to diversify because it's more different.
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.620]   It's more different than the fixed income.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.860]   It's more different than the all stock portfolio.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.980]   So if we were to look now at how they've performed
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.660]   in the past, do they do what I say, right?
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.380]   Do they, did they really, could you really buy this?
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.860]   That's another way to look at it.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.380]   And did it really make a difference?
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.420]   And you can test this at PortfolioVisualizer.com.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.220]   Tuomo runs a great site there.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.740]   It's free and you can go back test asset allocations
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.060]   into all of these assets that are on the board,
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.180]   the value, the blend, the growth, the large,
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.740]   the mid and the small.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.380]   And you can see how they've performed since 1972.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.580]   And what you'll see, I got to grab a marker here,
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:17.980]   is that Large Cap Blend, let's see.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.500]   Yeah, so Large Cap Blend has delivered
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.220]   about a 10.55% annual return.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.180]   And interestingly, the total market has also delivered
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.500]   about a 10.55% rate of return.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.620]   And it's come at a cost, if you will,
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.180]   a behavioral cost of tolerating a 51% worst drawdown.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.580]   So you had to be willing to lose 50% of your money on paper,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.660]   but if you stuck with it and you endured
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.620]   and you didn't bail when the market was down,
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.780]   you got the return of 10.55%, which isn't too bad.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.300]   That's actually amazingly good.
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.260]   What's interesting is that the total market
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.980]   did about the same thing as Large Blend.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.420]   Now, how can that be, right?
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.780]   How can it be that when I add in the mid caps
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.020]   and I add in the small caps and I add in the growth
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.140]   and I add in the value, I get the same return?
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.380]   Well, first of all, the mids and the small
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.380]   don't make up a lot of the market.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.860]   The bulk of the market, 80 plus percentage of the market
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.620]   is in these large companies.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.220]   So they just don't add a lot of weight.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.820]   And then the other thing that's true
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.260]   is when you add the value and you add the growth,
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.500]   they cancel each other out.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.860]   You don't have a tilt to either value or growth.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.780]   You end up back at the same place you started.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.580]   You end up with Blend.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.460]   So this area, this Large Cap Blend that I've highlighted,
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.540]   that's essentially what you get with the S&P 500.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.180]   It's also pretty close to what you get
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.980]   with the total market.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.180]   Now, I said we have two spices we can spice things up with.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.540]   If you come over here to Large Cap Value,
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.340]   you can see you get about 6/10 of a percent
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.300]   higher rate of return with a little bit higher volatility,
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.620]   about 4% more or worse drawdown that you had to tolerate.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.100]   The drawdown is how much your balance declined from its peak
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.420]   or how much the account got smaller from its peak
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.220]   before it turned around and started coming back up.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.260]   If you look down here in the bottom left, though,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.780]   look at the strong spice.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.220]   13.94% was the compound rate of return.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.300]   So that's over 3 percentage points, almost 3 and 1/2
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.420]   percentage points of compound annual rate of return
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.700]   benefit for spicing the portfolio
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.620]   or investing in the strong spice.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.420]   And it came with a little bit more volatility.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.780]   Now we're at 56% drawdown, but not much, not much.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.500]   So the return per unit of risk in small cap value
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.180]   is actually the highest of anything on the chart.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.180]   Interestingly, the worst return per unit of risk
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.620]   is in this bottom right-hand corner in small cap growth.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.820]   So in some respects, there are two lessons here.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.260]   One is you want to spice things with value and small.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.500]   But the other is you want to avoid small cap growth.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.500]   You want to avoid that part of the market that's
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.020]   in the bottom right-hand corner.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.420]   And again, if you buy the whole market, you get them both,
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.180]   and they kind of cancel each other out.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.020]   So let's take a look at what things
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.020]   look like without inflation.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.980]   Let's look at real returns.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.900]   And let's simplify it down to our three key ingredients.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.700]   We've got bonds down here in the bottom left.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.500]   We've got stocks up here in the middle.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.140]   And we've got small cap value stocks
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.380]   over on the bottom right.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.140]   And they kind of form a triangle of returns.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.220]   And now we're looking at returns that
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.380]   are real, which means without the effects of inflation
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.740]   or with inflation removed.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.100]   So we can see how our buying power is increasing.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.180]   And what you see is that the compound annual growth
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.420]   rate for bonds--
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.820]   this is intermediate term government bonds--
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.780]   is very low.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.180]   It's about 2%.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.380]   And not surprisingly, that doesn't
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.820]   enable you to take much out safely in retirement.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.020]   It only has a 40-year safe withdrawal rate
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.780]   of a little bit less than 2%.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.060]   But it's very safe, only minus 9%, worst case drawdown.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.580]   If you look at stocks, now we're talking
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.660]   about a meaningful engine to drive good returns.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.820]   You get 6.8% going back to 1928.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.540]   That was the median compound annual growth rate
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.100]   after taking out inflation.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.500]   That's really strong.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.660]   But you had to tolerate a worst case drawdown of 83%.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.740]   And it generated a 3% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.700]   It's better on safe withdrawal rate, but worse on drawdowns.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.620]   And if we look at small cap value,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.060]   obviously the highest compound rate of return,
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.620]   but also the worst drawdown.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.620]   And interestingly, not the best safe withdrawal rate either.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.060]   The best safe withdrawal rate on this chart is right up here.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.500]   It's for all stocks.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   So does that mean we should just be all stocks in retirement?
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.180]   Well, we haven't looked at what happens
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.140]   when you combine these.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.940]   Let's take a look at the combinations.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.900]   So if we look at the middle of each side--
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.180]   so that would be a 50/50 combination of stocks and bonds,
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.500]   or a 50/50 combination of stocks and small cap value,
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.420]   or a 50/50 combination of bonds and small cap value--
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.860]   the highest safe withdrawal rate is actually
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.820]   down here on the bottom now, which
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.300]   is starting to speak to this idea
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.420]   that depending on the meal you want to eat,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.860]   the ingredients that you use may vary.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.900]   If you want the safest retirement portfolio out
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.900]   of these combinations, it would probably
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.700]   be this one at the bottom.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.740]   It doesn't have the lowest drawdown.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.700]   It's got a drawdown of 60% out of the ones on the sides.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.700]   But it's got a really strong compound rate of return at 6.8%.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.900]   If you want the lowest drawdown out of these 50/50 combos,
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.780]   it's right over here.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:07.340]   It's the combination of 50% bonds and 50% stocks.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.060]   These are US stocks, by the way, going back to 1928.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.100]   And if you want the highest rate of return, it's over here.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:20.140]   It's the combination of the 50% stocks and 50% small cap value.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:24.300]   So we're starting to play around with mixing this up.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.540]   And if you want all the gory details,
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.060]   if you want to see all the 10% changes,
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.020]   I've got it going back to 1928 and 1970.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.060]   This is out of my book, Two Funds for Life.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.860]   I'm not going to spend any time on those.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.260]   They're just too complex for this.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.420]   But I will make the point that the highest safe withdrawal
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.260]   rates always come from a combination of these asset
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.780]   classes, not from the extremes.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.060]   And I think that leads nicely into this idea
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.900]   of a balanced portfolio, having a little bit
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.500]   of a lot of different things rather than all one.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.060]   So some of you, if you're still with me,
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.820]   are probably thinking, but I don't want to cook, right?
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.740]   I don't want to be combining all these ingredients.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.580]   Just give me the fast food meal or give me
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.980]   the microwave dinner.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.220]   And we can do that.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.820]   We can talk about some microwave dinners, some really easy ways
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.700]   to get things done.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.980]   And in fact, most of the rest of the presentation,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.380]   we'll talk about that.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.380]   And there are two categories that I
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.260]   think are really interesting.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.940]   The first is a set of funds called balanced funds.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.740]   You can get them from Vanguard in their life strategy funds.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.860]   You can get them from a lot of other providers as well.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.580]   And the second is something called a target-based fund.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.820]   And many of you are probably familiar with it.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.020]   And whether you use it or not, you almost certainly
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.540]   know somebody who does because they're
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.660]   the default for a lot of new 401(k) programs for employers.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.060]   Let's start by looking at these life strategy
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.340]   funds with fixed allocations.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.620]   And we'll start by looking at the Vanguard life strategy
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.780]   funds.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.860]   I've pulled up four of them here.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.100]   And they go from a 20% stock, 80% bond allocation
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.700]   to an 80% stock, 20% bond allocation.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.420]   And the way Vanguard describes them
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.860]   is they go from low to moderate, to moderate, to moderate
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.820]   to high, to high risk.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.500]   That's their definitions.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.500]   They're all a balance that tilts a little bit more
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.900]   towards the US, like 60% US, 40% international.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.460]   But we can run the back tests and see
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.220]   how they did historically.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   And what we see, not surprisingly,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:37.620]   is that as we add stock, we go from a 6.4% median compound
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.900]   annual rate of return to 7.6% to 8.6% to 9.3%.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.180]   It's a pretty steady 1% increase with each step up
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.340]   in how aggressive we're being.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.300]   But look what happened to the drawdown risk.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.780]   You had to take a lot more risk or tolerate a lot more
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.300]   volatility to get it.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.780]   This 2080 fund had a 20% worst case drawdown.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.420]   That's not bad.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.740]   The 4060, even though it only gives you
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.740]   1% higher compound annual rate of return,
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.060]   had almost twice the drawdown risk.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.940]   And the 6040 was 54%.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.220]   And the 8020 was 66%.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.340]   So these higher returns accumulate over time.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.020]   But somewhere along the way, you're
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.500]   going to have to have conviction to tolerate a much bumpier ride
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.460]   to get it.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.180]   Now, these numbers go back to 1928.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.980]   If I went back to 1970, they'd be maybe 2/3 the size.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.100]   So your ride may not be that bad.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.460]   But it's nice to know it could be, just so that you're
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.660]   ready and ready to stick with whatever
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.540]   investment it is you pick.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.380]   We can also look inside these portfolios
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.180]   and see which of those key attributes they're firing on.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.420]   And all of these funds fire only on three.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.900]   They fire on the market risk, the term risk,
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.740]   and the credit risk.
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.020]   That's it, just three.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.540]   We can also look and see what their safe withdrawal rates
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.340]   are.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.660]   And kind of interesting, if we look at the safe withdrawal
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.500]   rates, they increase across the board.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.700]   The highest is over here with the portfolio that
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.060]   has the bumpiest ride.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.820]   It has the biggest drawdowns.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.420]   But it also has the highest safe withdrawal rate.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.700]   So I think the key takeaway here for a retiree
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.700]   is that it makes sense to keep your equity engine alive.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.020]   Don't get too conservative in retirement,
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.700]   especially if you need a higher withdrawal rate.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.180]   Because having a portfolio that can't withstand whatever
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.780]   withdrawal rate you need increases your risk
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.220]   of running out of money or falling
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.980]   on a bad sequence of returns that basically put you
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.740]   out of business.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.940]   So that was a set of things you can do with one fund.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.020]   All of those are just one fund.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.460]   But they all fire on only three of these attributes.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.500]   What would happen if we brought in some more of the attributes,
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.140]   if we spiced it up a little bit?
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.300]   Well, why would we want to spice it up?
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.980]   If you go and take a look at Andrew Birkin and Larry
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.300]   Suedro's excellent book, Your Complete Guide
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.540]   to Factor-Based Investing, one of the really interesting
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.740]   things you'll learn is that factors
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.900]   tend to show up at different times in the market.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.700]   So that means that when one's going up,
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.100]   the other one might be going down.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.940]   Or when one's going up a lot, the other one
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.300]   might be going up a little.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.140]   And we kind of knew intuitively, when
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.380]   you combine things that zig and zag at different times,
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.820]   you have the potential to smooth the ride.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.940]   And a multi-factor portfolio, or one
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.660]   that fires on more of these attributes,
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.540]   tends to disappoint less often.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.580]   And you can see that over here on the right.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.380]   A market-only fund, that would be like a total market or S&P
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.260]   500 fund, at five years has about an 18% chance
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.380]   of not delivering the return that you expect.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.500]   In contrast, at five years, a fund
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:08.220]   that has exposure to market, size, value, and momentum
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.580]   has about a 5% chance of underperforming.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.780]   So the difference there is pretty dramatic.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:20.020]   You're talking about a factor of three increase in the likelihood
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.140]   that you're going to get the return that you expect.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.540]   I think most of us would like that.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.100]   We'd kind of like to have more predictable performance.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.420]   So let's take those two of the two funds we looked at,
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.860]   or the four funds we looked at earlier.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.540]   Let's look at the Vanguard Life Strategy 60/40
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.900]   and the Vanguard Life Strategy 80/20.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.500]   We've already analyzed those.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.940]   And let's slide something in between.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.540]   A 60% stock for--
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:55.140]   Chris, you've muted yourself.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.620]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:13.060]   How long have I been muted?
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.300]   You muted right about when you first
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.820]   started with the 60/40 Vanguard Life Strategy fund,
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.740]   and you added your spices.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.420]   Excellent.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.180]   OK.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.500]   Well, thank you for telling me.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.620]   Sorry, I have no idea how that happened,
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.020]   but I'm glad we're back.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.500]   OK, well, so what I've done here on this chart
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.620]   is we've brought back the same analysis we had before
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.060]   with the 60/40 stock bond, Vanguard Life Strategy,
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.660]   and the 80/20.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.620]   And we've slid something in between, which is a 60/40.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:49.300]   So it's the same equity bond mix of the fund on the left.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.740]   But we've done it with 35% US small cap value and 25%
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.100]   international small cap value.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.340]   And the interesting thing is that we
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.420]   get a much higher compound annual rate of return
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.260]   than we do with the other 60/40.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.740]   Not surprisingly, I guess.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.860]   We took more risk.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:12.300]   We added in this volatile class, our spicy mix of small cap
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.540]   value.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.340]   But the drawdown, the worst case drawdown, only went up by 5%.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.780]   So our return per unit of risk is much higher.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.260]   And interestingly, our return is also
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.260]   higher than the 80/20 would have been had we just
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.060]   gone with the Vanguard fund.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.020]   And our drawdown is better than the 80/20 would have been.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.460]   And why is that?
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.900]   It's because of this diversification down here.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.300]   We have far more working for us.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.900]   We have the market exposure.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.860]   We have the term and the credit exposure.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.980]   But we also have value and size working for us.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.860]   So it's a multi-factor kind of approach,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.980]   even though we're just doing it with small cap
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.540]   value and total bond funds.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.900]   The safe withdrawal rates also went up.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.620]   The highest safe withdrawal rates are with this--
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.060]   it seems like kind of an extreme allocation
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.780]   because it's heavy on small cap value.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.420]   Would I recommend that a retiree invest in this portfolio?
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:10.940]   No.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.740]   But as a teaching moment, I think
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.380]   I would point out that it might benefit them
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.940]   to have some in small cap value because it's
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.260]   going to improve their return per unit of risk,
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.420]   and it's going to improve their resiliency in retirement.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:31.100]   So with that, that's kind of our fixed allocations.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.780]   Let's take a look at time-varying allocations.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.020]   And to set this up, first of all,
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.420]   we have to think about, well, why do we change our asset
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.220]   allocations over time?
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.740]   Why would we not just have the same asset allocation
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:45.620]   our whole lifetime?
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.580]   And some people do.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.140]   Some people have the temperament to be
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.060]   stocks their entire life.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:56.460]   And that may work fine for them, but it's not
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.180]   in line with what most people would describe as our risk
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.900]   capacity as we go through life.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.780]   I think a stock allocation that's 100% through life
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.900]   works primarily for somebody who's an over-saver
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.180]   and who has incredible behavioral skills
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.540]   as an investor, the ability to ignore the ups and downs
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.580]   of the market.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.260]   But for most of us, especially those of us
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.380]   who are going to be just enough savers,
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.020]   it's really important to understand that our risk
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.260]   profile changes with time.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.420]   When we're young, when we're over here
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.940]   in this early part of the chart on the left-hand side
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.780]   around age 25, if we lost our whole net worth,
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.940]   we've still got a lifetime to work to earn it back.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.940]   We have 40 years probably of career
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:48.020]   for earning and letting not just our work earn us money,
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.260]   but letting the market earn us money as well
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.780]   through compounding.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.140]   Halfway through our career, we've got a lot less.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.620]   And when we're nearing 65, we're nearly done.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.660]   Most of us are not going to be able to work another 20 or 30
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:05.020]   years at age 65, let alone want to.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:10.020]   And so our risk capacity is declining with time.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.500]   And our ability to have the market work for us
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.900]   is declining with time.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.540]   It's only natural then that our portfolio risk would also
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.820]   decline with time.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.860]   And the industry taking this into account
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.020]   has invented this amazing tool called a target date fund.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:30.220]   You can get them from Vanguard now for 0.08%.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:34.180]   So eight basis points gets you effectively a robo-advisor.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.700]   And what it does--
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.340]   we'll talk about Vanguard specifically,
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.900]   but what they do in general in the market
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.700]   is they follow a path of decreasing allocation
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.980]   to equities and increasing allocation to bonds.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.540]   And that's called a glide path.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.220]   So this is an example of the industry average target
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.420]   the glide path on the right-hand side.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:00.020]   And you can see that the equities are declining over
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.580]   time, and the bonds are increasing over time.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.300]   And they do that not just to retirement,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.700]   but through retirement.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.220]   And if we looked at the Vanguard glide path--
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.900]   you can see it on the right here--
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.380]   you can see that they start ramping down
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.220]   about 40 years before retirement,
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.300]   and they ramp through to about seven years after retirement.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:27.500]   And their early allocation is about 90% equities.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.580]   And the way you use these, and the way a lot of new investors
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.580]   are defaulted into them, in fact, is by year.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.700]   So if I was a new employee at a company,
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.340]   I'd probably get an email that said,
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.460]   we're going to invest 3% of your paycheck
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.020]   automatically into the--
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.580]   if I'm 25 years old and I've got 40 years to work--
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:52.420]   maybe it's the 2065 target date fund.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.380]   And if I do nothing, that's what happens.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.340]   I can increase it.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.140]   I can change it.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.820]   But a huge amount of today's assets in 401(k)s
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.540]   are in target date funds.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.620]   And the question is, is that good?
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.300]   Is it good?
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.140]   And I think it's not good.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.380]   I think it's wonderful.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.460]   And the reason I think it's wonderful
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:17.140]   is that if we were to look at a lifetime investor who,
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:22.460]   on first chance, when they are faced with this 401(k) decision,
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.220]   says, I'm going to put 10% of my income
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.980]   into the target date fund.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.620]   And they do that for 40 years of working.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.100]   And then at the end of those 40 years,
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.700]   decide to take 4% out the first year
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.300]   and increase with inflation for 30 years of retirement.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:46.220]   That 10% that they invested will turn into a pile of money
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.540]   that is much, much bigger than--
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.700]   well, not much, much bigger, but about the same size
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.340]   to a little bit bigger than everything
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.300]   they earned in real dollars.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:00.340]   This is after adjusting for inflation in real dollars.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.020]   And they'll have about half of it to spend in retirement
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.340]   and half of it as legacy.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.060]   So just pause and think about that for a moment.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.500]   This single investment, one tool that you can automate and put
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.660]   in the background for your entire lifetime
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.780]   can double the amount of spending power you have.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.420]   I think it's just magical.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.100]   It's an incredible tool.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.220]   I don't think it's perfect, but I
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.420]   think it's designed for the masses,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.740]   and it serves them well.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.420]   And I think many, many people would
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:35.300]   be as well off doing this as 90% of the other choices
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.380]   that they're likely to make.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.860]   So it looks like it works most of the time
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.300]   for most of the people.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.260]   But does it do exactly what it says it does?
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.060]   Well, let's take a look.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.660]   If you went back and looked at a lump sum investor
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.980]   and you analyzed all of the different months
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.420]   they could have started from--
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.860]   I'm only going to 1970 here, but January 1970, February 1970,
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.380]   all these different start months when
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.620]   their career might have begun.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.260]   And you look at the worst case drawdown
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.220]   that might have been experienced across all of those lifetimes,
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.060]   you get this line down here at the bottom that goes across.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.900]   And it shows that their worst risk exposure
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:22.580]   is in these early years from age 27, 28, something like that,
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.580]   through about age 40.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.140]   And then it declines all the way out to retirement.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.900]   It looks like it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do,
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.140]   but there's a problem.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.900]   And the problem is that it's based on a lump sum investment.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.540]   Almost no one starts with a lump sum investment
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.740]   saving for retirement.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.540]   We generally start with practically nothing
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.300]   and contribute monthly.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.220]   So what happens if we do monthly contributions?
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.900]   Well, now we get a totally different picture.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.340]   Now we don't actually see much risk in these early years
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:52.820]   at all.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.020]   In fact, we see a lot of wasted potential for taking risk.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:02.940]   And the worst drawdown doesn't occur until age 40.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.500]   It's about 42%.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.820]   And yes, it does decline towards retirement.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.060]   And why is that?
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.460]   How could that be?
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.020]   What's going on here?
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.060]   Some of you probably know.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.300]   What's going on is contributions.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.860]   And by the way, I've taken these drawdown numbers just
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.180]   before the next contribution, so they're worst case.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.740]   But if you ask a young investor when the market's down
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.380]   how bad their investments have done, almost none of them
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.420]   have run an IRR calculation and can tell you.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.340]   They just look at their balance and say, well,
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.740]   it's bigger than it was last year.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.660]   It doesn't look too bad to me.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.900]   And people who advise young investors actually see that.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.700]   And if you don't believe me, we can actually
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.140]   look at a back test here.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.820]   I chose a volatile asset class.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.020]   This is small cap value.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.060]   We started in 1970.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.460]   And this grayed out deep drop right here
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.220]   is what a lump sum investor would have experienced.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.420]   And these shallow dips up here are
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:03.700]   what the dollar cost averaging or the annual contribution
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.980]   investor experienced, much, much shallower drawdowns.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.780]   And it's because they've got these regular contributions.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   So with that in mind, knowing that there's
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.940]   a little more room for risk, we'll
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.940]   analyze the target date fund.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.380]   But let's also look at some simple ways
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.340]   we could spice it up.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.740]   And these are three strategies that come out
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.460]   of our two funds for life book.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.980]   One is easy, and this is simply a 90/10 allocation,
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.180]   90% to the target date fund, 10% to small cap value.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.540]   And it's not rebalanced during the early years.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:47.620]   And then it is nudge withdrawals in the retirement years.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.300]   Now, what do I mean by nudge withdrawals?
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.340]   I just mean you take your whole withdrawal out
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.820]   of whichever fund is too big.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.620]   So you've got a 90/10 allocation.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.660]   If the target date fund is 11%, you
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.300]   take your 4% withdrawal from that.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.540]   If the target date fund is at 91%,
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.420]   you take the withdrawal from that.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:12.580]   So it's simple, and in my back testing, it works pretty well.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.500]   And it avoids having to make a lot of emotional decisions
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.180]   about rebalancing.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.860]   The second strategy we'll look at
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:23.140]   is a moderate one that starts at about a 60% allocation
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:27.700]   to US small cap value and declines all the way down
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:32.300]   to the full target date fund, 100% in the target date
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.980]   fund in retirement.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.820]   And that's the moderate two fund for life.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.460]   And then the last one, let's just be crazy.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.460]   And we'll go aggressive.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.540]   We'll go hyper-aggressive.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.340]   We'll be 100% target date fund in the early years,
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.860]   because remember, there wasn't enough risk there.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.020]   So let's see if this just pushes us over the edge.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.860]   And we'll ramp that down to 20% in retirement,
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.180]   because it might improve the safe withdrawal
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.540]   rates in retirement.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.140]   And let's see how those did.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.300]   So if we take a look at it, what we see
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.020]   is that the target date fund is--
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.260]   these are the 1928 numbers.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:11.740]   It's going to potentially make you tolerate a 65% drawdown,
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.780]   but it's going to give you a very solid 8.5%
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.820]   rate of return for that.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.780]   And it's going to have the diversification we expect,
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.900]   just credit, term, and market.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.740]   This easy strategy gives you about an extra 1% in return,
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.460]   slight increase in the drawdown, a little bit of a bump
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.180]   in the drawdown towards retirement.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.940]   That's not ideal, but a much more diversified portfolio
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.260]   down here in terms of the attributes
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.060]   the portfolio is firing on.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.900]   And then the moderate one, the moderate two-fund-for-life,
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.980]   is about the same return, but it tames the risk out here
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.900]   by retirement.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.220]   So this is lower, and it brings some of that risk
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.940]   into the early years.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.060]   And interestingly, it's not as diversified.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.540]   Why is it not as diversified?
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.540]   I mean, we've got that 100% allocation to small in value
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.860]   in the early years.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.300]   Well, the reason it's not as well diversified
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.180]   is there aren't as many dollars in those early years.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:15.500]   So even though it sounds extreme to pull the asset allocation up
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.060]   in the early years, you're not taking a risk
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.300]   with a huge amount of dollars.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.660]   So it doesn't tilt it that much.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.460]   And then the most aggressive one over here,
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.820]   obviously the highest return, comes with the highest risk,
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.300]   but the highest amount of diversification.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.140]   And I think that this is intriguing,
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.660]   but if I was a young person, what I'd really want to know
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:40.420]   is, how did they do at multiplying my buying power?
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.900]   What's my real dollar benefit from doing this?
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.580]   And to do that, we need to calculate
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.980]   what I call a real dollar multiplier.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.860]   And the way we'll do that is we will remove inflation
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.580]   to get the real future balances and the real contributions.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.500]   And we will divide the real balance
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.140]   that we have at 40 years--
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.460]   that's the inflation-adjusted real purchasing power--
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.140]   by the total real contributions that we've made.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:12.020]   And when we do that, we get a really interesting set
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.900]   of numbers down here at the bottom.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.140]   Every single one of these strategies
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.540]   did better than double your purchasing power
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.340]   across a 40-year period of accumulation
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.660]   across all of the time frames that we looked at.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.780]   That was the worst.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.780]   They all did better than double.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.500]   The place where they really differ is in upside.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.300]   The target date fund gives you about an upside,
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.140]   the best-case scenario, of multiplying your purchasing
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.500]   power by about 5 and 1/2.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.900]   The easy two funds for life is a little more than 7.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.340]   The moderate two funds for life was almost 8.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.900]   And the aggressive strategy was about 14.
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.700]   So the averages are between the two.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.820]   And the medians, or the expected values, are between the two.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.940]   So each of these strategies, as it takes more risk,
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.260]   is likely leading to you having more purchasing power later
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.340]   in life, which I think is powerful.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.020]   So that covered accumulation.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.140]   But what about retirement?
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.580]   To do retirement, we're going to use a different multiplier.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.780]   We're going to look at the nest egg multiplier, which
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.860]   is the real withdrawals plus the real end balance divided
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.900]   by the initial nest egg.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.100]   So that's all the money you get to spend in retirement
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.820]   plus pass on to errors divided by the initial nest egg.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.460]   And what we see here is that, again, there's
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.860]   this growing increase between--
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.900]   by the way, I've combined the target date fund
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.220]   and moderate in this column because they're
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.100]   the same thing.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.940]   They're all 100% target date fund in retirement.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.620]   So that's about a 7.2 CAGR.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.700]   The easy one is about a 7.7 CAGR.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.020]   The aggressive is about 8.7.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.780]   And because the aggressive is tilting us more towards the US,
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.860]   I added another aggressive over here
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.660]   that includes a mix of US and international small cap value.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.660]   And it performed a little bit more poorly,
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.260]   but is better balanced in terms of its geography.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.780]   The scary part, though, most of you who are watching
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.380]   have probably already picked up on it,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.740]   is that these ran out of money in retirement.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.540]   Now, this is a 40-year retirement,
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.500]   so it's a long time of 4% withdrawals.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.820]   They all, at some point from 1928 to 2021,
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.620]   on one of those scenarios, ran out of money.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.980]   But what's more meaningful is probably their survival rates.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.740]   And that's right here.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.340]   And they all did pretty well.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:42.060]   So the target date fund had a 99% survival rate for 30 years
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.060]   and an 88% survival rate for 40 years.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.820]   As we go across the chart, they get better.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.460]   The easy-to fund for life was 97%, roughly,
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.500]   in terms of the 40-year safe withdrawal rate --
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.700]   or, I mean, survival rate.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:03.260]   And the aggressives both had practically 100%.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.500]   And down at the bottom,
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.260]   if we look at their safe withdrawal rates,
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.340]   the best safe withdrawal rates --
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.620]   actually, the aggressive strategy.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.900]   So, again, as a retiree,
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.620]   I would encourage you to hold some small-cap value
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.500]   because it's going to boost the resilience of your portfolio.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.700]   And the multipliers are down here at the bottom.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:28.220]   The worst, 1.1, is for the target date fund,
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.100]   but they're all about the same -- 1.1, 1.2.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.340]   And the upside benefit just comes with more tilt
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.660]   towards the more volatile assets of small-in-value.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:42.580]   So the final topic, what do we give up by being simple?
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.660]   Well, I've analyzed a very complicated
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:51.220]   Merriman target-date portfolio using 13 asset classes.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.340]   That's over on the right.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.260]   And a two-fund-for-life aggressive strategy.
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.740]   And the answer is not much.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.300]   The two-fund-for-life aggressive
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.020]   actually had the higher return, very slight.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.900]   I'd say that for all intents and purposes, they're the same.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.140]   But what this says is with two funds,
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.140]   you could do almost everything you can do with 13,
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.140]   and it's much, much easier to manage.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.100]   There are things that we give up, though, some real things.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.180]   And the most important one is probably tax efficiency.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.460]   When you bundle your equities and your bonds
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.940]   together in a single fund, you can't --
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.540]   if they're all in a tax-deferred fund,
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:32.980]   a Roth IRA or a 401(k), you're fine.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.420]   But if they're in a taxable account,
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.380]   you'd really like to separate out the bonds
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.100]   and put them in the tax-deferred account.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.460]   So that's a cost to simplicity.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.580]   You can't do the account location as precisely.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.060]   You also can't control individual attributes
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.500]   of the portfolio as precisely.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.460]   You don't have independent control
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:58.820]   over the U.S. international small/large value growth splits.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.180]   You lose some regret avoidance.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:05.940]   You know, if large-cap blend is the hot thing last year,
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.100]   if it had the best return, you don't hold that fund,
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.380]   and you might regret that.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.540]   So that's an issue.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.820]   And then personal preference.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.700]   Some people just like the complexity.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.500]   So in summary, simple, balanced portfolios
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.700]   can broadly diversify across companies,
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.180]   countries, factors, age,
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:29.500]   and they can improve the likely return per drawdown risk
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.100]   in accumulation and improve your safe withdrawal rates
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.020]   and survival rates and resiliency
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.220]   and end balances in retirement.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.380]   But they do give these few things up --
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.980]   customization, tax efficiency,
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.180]   the chance to always own what's hot,
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.900]   and the chance to be with the herd.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.340]   So I'd encourage you to look for more on our website,
