[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, the love of money is the root of every kind of evil.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   So what kind of warning should be sounded to Christian entrepreneurs
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   who have financially embarked on a venture to raise a lot of cash for a new business?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's a really good and sharp question from a listener named William.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   "Hello Pastor John, 1 Timothy is really an exhortation against false teachers
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   and the problems in that church because of them.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Saying that, chapter 6 deals with such.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   I've always had a hard time fully understanding verse 9 about desiring to be rich.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I am an entrepreneur and a business owner,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and with my business I want to fund myself and my team in order to do missions together.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Therefore, I desire to raise a lot of money.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Does this contradict the Bible?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Is it in a context of greed or desiring money as ultimate?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   What does it mean to be rich, and to what level does this cover?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Is there a godly way to pursue a lot of funding?"
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Let's start with the words of Jesus and then make our way to the text he referred to,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   especially 1 Timothy 6.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Jesus said in Matthew 6, 19,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and where thieves break in and steal.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And later, Jesus illustrated the dangers of this laying up treasures on earth
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   by describing the fool whose business prospered,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and he kept building bigger and bigger barns to accumulate more and more profits that he was earning.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And he said this, "Soul, you have ample goods."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Way more than ample, in fact.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   "You have ample goods laid up for many years.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Relax, eat, drink, be merry."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   That's Luke 12, 19.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And God said, "Fool," well, you don't want to be called a fool by God.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   You can be called a fool by man, but you don't want to be called a fool by God.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   God said, "Fool, this night your soul is required of you,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and the things you've prepared in all those barns, whose will they be?"
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Now, the problem here is not that this man's business prospered.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's almost inevitable that gifted, hardworking business people with integrity
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   are going to run businesses that prosper.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   They are.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   They're going to be successful, by and large.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   They're going to make a lot of money.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   That's not what Jesus condemned here, as though he would say,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   "You know, if you're good at what you do, you should stop doing it."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   That's not the way Jesus dealt with things.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   The problem was the bigger and bigger barns.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The problem was accumulation, accompanied byâ€”and I say accompanied by,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   because it could be both cause or effect.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   The problem was accumulation accompanied by a sense of self-reliant,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   self-satisfied ease in this world, as though the next world,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   or the world in need over there in who knows what neighborhood,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   don't really matter to me.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Jesus correlates excessive accumulation with the place where your heart is resting,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   where your treasure is, there's your heart.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Where your treasure is, there is your heart.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So if it's not evil to be successful in business,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and it is evil to accumulate and accumulate and accumulate
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   because of your sense of needed security and your pride
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   and your indifference to the world and your indifference to coming judgment,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   then the implication would be, "Well, something else should be done
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   with the proceeds of all that God-given success."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So let's turn to 1 Timothy 6 and see what he says.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   This is 1 Timothy 6.6.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   "Godliness with contentment is great gain.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   We brought nothing into the world.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   We can take nothing out of the world.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   If we have food and clothing with these, we will be content.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   This is the kind of witness which may attract the world as unusual."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So they say, as they do in 1 Peter 3.15,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   "What's the reason for the hope that is in you?"
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Because they can see that our hope is not based like theirs
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   on getting richer and richer and richer.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   That's why they ask, "What's the reason for the hope that is in you?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You seem to be content with food and clothing,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and you're somehow making yourselves a conduit of extraordinary generosity."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   This is the difference between true Christianity and the prosperity gospel.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   The prosperity gospel believes that the world will see
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   the material prosperity of Christians and be motivated to embrace Christ.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Well, that's not the way it works.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   What they are motivated to do is embrace the money
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   that the Christians have wanted to accumulate,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and if Christ can be a good stock investment to get that,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   well, I'll use Christ for that to get what I really want.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's not saving faith.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   If we have food and clothing with these, we will be content,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   because Christ has made an incredible future for us
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and provided all our soul needs.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Now, that might cause the world to wake up
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and ask a reason for the hope that is in us,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   because it seems to them like we're not hoping
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   in the same stuff they're hoping in, namely the accumulation of wealth.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Then the text continues, "But those who desire to be rich"
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Now, that is not necessarily the successful businessman.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Let's make this distinction again.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   That's the man who sees his business prospering
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   and falls for the temptation that he needs to continually increase his lifestyle
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   with the symbols of wealth and power,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and what he wears and what he lives in and what he drives
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   and the vacations he takes.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   They all have to look rich, rich, rich and opulent,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   otherwise people won't know how much money I'm really making
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and how successful I am.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   That's the falling into temptation and into a snare
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and into senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   for the love of money and all those symbols of wealth is the root of evil.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And I think that sentence, "The love of money is the root of all evil,"
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   should be translated that way rather than just by all kinds of evil,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   because the heart that loves money, needs money to be content,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   is not content in God.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   That is the kind of heart that produces all evil, period.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   All evil comes from that kind of heart.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and pierced themselves with many pangs.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So that's Paul's version of the warning about wealth-loving barn-building
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   in Jesus' words.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And then in verse 17, he gives an alternative vision
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   for the successful Christian entrepreneur.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   So listen up.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   This is the question that was really being asked.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   "As for the rich in the present age, charge them not to be haughty.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Know yourself and your sin and your weaknesses and your dependence
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and your God and your Calvary, and know them so well
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   that money can't make you proud," he continues,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   "nor set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Know how fragile your body is, how fragile your mind is, Mr. Rich Man.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Know how fragile the economy is.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Know how fragile the culture is.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Know how fragile the economic theories are.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Know how fragile and temporary this whole world is,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   that you cannot be foolish as to bank on something so fragile as riches,"
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   he continues, "but set your hope on God, who richly provides us
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   with everything to enjoy.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And that enjoyment is not only the simple delights of eating and drinking
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and reading and gardening, but even more, the delights in sharing
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   those resources with others because it is more enjoyable to give
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   than to receive."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Jesus said that in Acts 20.35.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And then he closes, "They are to do good, to be rich in good works."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   That's the alternative to bigger barns, rich in good works,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   to be generous, ready to share, thus storing up treasure.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Remember, Jesus said, "Don't lay up treasures on earth.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Lay up treasures in heaven."
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Well, here's Paul's interpretation of that.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Thus, that is, in doing all those good works and making all that glorious
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   entrepreneurial success a means of doing good in the world,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   so that they may take hold of life, which is life indeed.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So, William, it seems to me that the bottom line in answering your question
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   is that we pursue a heart that is so satisfied in God and all that he is
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   for us in Christ through the gospel that we are freed from the craving
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   to accumulate and that we turn our great earnings, which are not evil,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   we turn our great earnings into doing good for others.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And I don't simply say giving away to others.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I don't want to be simplistic here.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I'm not saying if you're rich, give your money away.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That's not wise, necessarily.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Here's what I say.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Because giving your money away may not be nearly as effective in doing good
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   as by creating an industry that employs 10,000 people, which would be better?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   To give 10,000 jobless people jobs or to give 10,000 people $100 each
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   or whatever, $1,000 for that matter.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Way better to get them working and you might have the way to do it.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   This is a profound and beautiful work of God in the heart of the diligent,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   creative, honest, humble, unashamed, Christ-exalting entrepreneur
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   who has not deceived himself but truly longs to live for the glory of God
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   and the good of others, especially the eternal good.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Yeah, that's very good.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And may God bless every Christian business owner with wisdom as they
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   steward God's money for its maximum benefit.

[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Well, speaking of building institutions,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   God gives each of us a unique blend of skills and inclinations,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   certain instincts and mental capacities, emotional strengths and tastes, etc.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So how do I know what role I'm supposed to play with my own set of gifts?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's a perennial question.
