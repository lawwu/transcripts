[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.600]   - We are back one last time with Sam Albury,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.960]   an author, speaker, and minister
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.480]   at St. Mary's Maidenhead Anglican Church in the UK.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.600]   And he joins us from his office in Oxford.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.280]   Sam, I wanna talk with you
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.640]   about the sexual identity conversations you've had
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.920]   specifically on secular college campuses.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.040]   This is a huge question facing pastors and leaders.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.760]   These conversations are as potentially volatile
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.360]   as they are potent for good.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.960]   Obviously, speaking of sexual practices and self-identity
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.880]   with biblical conviction and with humility,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.560]   these are conversations that open outreach opportunities
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.000]   like few other things do.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.880]   From your experience, what have you learned
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.020]   from publicly engaging LGBT societies on campus
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.800]   and how can we steward these types of conversations well?
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.640]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.880]   It's no surprise to anyone that this is a huge issue
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.000]   on our campuses at the moment.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.240]   And my suspicion is that the majority of people
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.280]   who are in ministry in campus contexts
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.080]   are pretty fearful of how this issue may play out for them.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.240]   There's the fear that if you kind of say
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.560]   anything remotely orthodox and biblical on this issue,
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.040]   that you'll be shut down immediately,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.760]   that you'll have massive amounts of opposition.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.560]   That is certainly a possibility,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.960]   but nevertheless, I think there are,
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.480]   there are just some wonderful opportunities
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.320]   to engage on this issue.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.160]   And my encouragement to pastors
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.040]   and to campus ministries out there is that actually,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.160]   there's a harvest to be had on this issue.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.240]   So I've had some experience of doing this,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.560]   not a huge amount by any means,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   but I've had a few opportunities to go onto secular campuses,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.880]   to talk and engage with secular LGBT students
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.080]   and I've really enjoyed it.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.720]   I mean, it's been, I'll be honest,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.240]   it's been a bit scary at times
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.120]   'cause you never quite know
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.160]   what kind of reaction you're going to get,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.520]   but I've really enjoyed it.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.840]   And there's a few things
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.240]   that have been quite key takeaways for me.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.760]   The first is that actually many of these people,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   we are nervous of because we think everyone is an activist
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.480]   and is out to kind of jump up and down on us.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600]   One of the things that was a bit of a revelation to me
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.320]   was that actually a lot of these students,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.440]   particularly in the LGBT societies on campus,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.040]   they were more fearful of me than I was of them.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.880]   - Wow.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.440]   - I remember giving a talk once at an event
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.160]   that was co-sponsored by the campus LGBT society.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.920]   So a lot of their members were present
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.400]   and there was an opportunity for people
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.480]   to line up behind the microphone and ask me questions.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.560]   And I could hear a few voices kind of cracking
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   as they would ask a question
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.400]   and I initially thought that was a sign of anger.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.480]   And as I got to listen to these people,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.680]   I began to realize, no, no, that's fear.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.880]   And it was a revelation to me
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.920]   because I don't think anyone's ever been frightened
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.400]   of me in my life.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.880]   And it actually broke my heart that these students were
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.380]   because they thought I hated them.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.960]   They thought I was out to kind of have a go at them
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.080]   and to attack them.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.760]   And I found that heartbreaking
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480]   because I was there to represent the Prince of Peace.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.440]   I was there to represent the most loving person
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   who ever lived.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.360]   And it just made me realize that the onus is on us
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.120]   as believers to show that we are for people
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.520]   and not against them, that we care for them,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.360]   that we don't hate them, that we want to know them.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.680]   And I think we assume we are the target,
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.400]   everyone else is the aggressor.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.680]   And so we're in defensive posture.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   Actually, I think we need to be the ones taking the initiative
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.360]   and just extending love and grace to people around us,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.720]   initiating friendship, doing what we can to serve others.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.560]   So that was the first thing was just realizing
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.280]   that just changed the way I spoke
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.080]   and changed the way I related to some of these guys.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.460]   I just thought I need to,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.200]   the first thing I need to do is reassure them
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.600]   of what I'm not.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.440]   Now, the second thing I realized is,
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.480]   and it's a bit of a cliche,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.080]   but the importance of listening well is huge.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.920]   There's a passage I've been reflecting on a lot recently
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.480]   that I think actually is very useful for this whole area.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   It's Proverbs 18, verse 13.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.840]   "If one gives an answer before he hears,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   it is his folly and shame."
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.980]   If one gives an answer before he hears,
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.960]   it's his folly and shame.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.840]   And I think too often we've been in kind of,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.320]   I've got to have my spiel that I've got to say to people.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   Actually, I find the more I listen to someone,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.200]   particularly in this context,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.000]   actually the much sharper my instinct is
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.200]   than of where I need to begin
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.960]   in sharing something of Christ.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.280]   The more I've heard them,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.200]   the more I will have a sense of who they are,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.260]   where they've come from, where they're at,
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.200]   and therefore where to start.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.520]   That's been huge for me.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.360]   And I found generally if I'm engaging with someone
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.640]   in that kind of context,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.200]   and they talk about being part of the LGBT society,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.400]   or whatever it might be,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.240]   just for me to say,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.520]   I'd just love to hear a bit more of your story.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.160]   If you feel comfortable sharing it with me,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.280]   it would be a real privilege to just hear a little bit
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.600]   about how things have been for you on this issue.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.560]   And generally by the time I've had a few minutes,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   or even longer to do that,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.080]   I get a sense of whether they've been wounded
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.560]   by some of the things that they've gone through,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.600]   whether they are, you know,
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.740]   there can be any number of things
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.600]   going on behind the surface.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.960]   And it just gives me a sense of whether I need to start
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.680]   with the compassion of Christ,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.520]   whether I need to start with the way in which
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.320]   Christ humbles us,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.480]   or whatever else it might be,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.960]   but listening has helped.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.080]   And then I think a third thing is that,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.080]   again, people assume that we are unjust and harmful
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.800]   in what we believe as Bible believing Christians
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.680]   about sexuality.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.200]   And so one of the things I want to try and show
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   as far as possible is that Jesus treats us the same.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.280]   The gospel puts us in the same boat.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.600]   And so a principle I've taken from that
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.160]   is not to say to someone what I can't say to everyone.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.680]   I can think of an event I was at recently,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.920]   a young lady came up to me afterwards and said,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.280]   "Well, I'm a lesbian, so what do you think about?"
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.640]   And my response to her was to say,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.560]   "Well, actually Jesus has some really interesting things
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.440]   "to say about sexuality to all of us."
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.160]   And she said, "Oh, well, why, what does he say?"
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.240]   And I talked a little bit about how Jesus shows
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.560]   that there's a kind of a brokenness,
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.480]   there's a skewedness to all of us
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.520]   that plays out even in our sexuality
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   for every single one of us.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.800]   And I wanted to see how far I could go in the conversation
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.320]   without saying anything that is specific to her lesbianism.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.960]   And I found that actually we could have a very,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.640]   very fruitful and long conversation
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.600]   without me having to touch on her specifics.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.720]   And I think that's important
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.600]   because she's not gonna properly hear
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.760]   what Jesus thinks of her specific situation
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.520]   unless she's heard what Jesus says to all of us.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.080]   So I wanted her to realize before we got to her,
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.320]   I wanted her to realize how the gospel levels
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.480]   are playing field, how we're, again,
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.240]   we're all in the same boat.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.040]   And again, I found that as being very, very,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.960]   that seems to be very fruitful.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.440]   I had a conversation with one student who came up to me
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.760]   and said, "I'm not a Christian, I'm gay,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.000]   "but I'm reading Mark's gospel at the moment."
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.800]   And he said he'd started going to a church
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.760]   and I asked him what was drawing him to Christian things.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.520]   And he said, "Well, I realized
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.760]   "that Jesus treats me the same."
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.520]   He said, "I've been part of a community
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.840]   "that has always said we are different and we are special,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.720]   "that we have a parade and everyone else celebrates us."
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.040]   But he said, "I realized that Jesus treats me the same
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.400]   "and actually I don't want to be different."
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   And it just hit me that actually there is a kind of equality
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.680]   you get with the message of Jesus
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.120]   that you don't get in a secular society
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.240]   that prides itself on equality.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.040]   So that's helped me just to think,
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.280]   okay, I'm not gonna say to someone
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.800]   what I can't say to everyone,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.920]   just because I'm trying to show them
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.560]   the gospel isn't unfair, it has the same humbling,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.000]   challenging message to all of us
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.920]   that will work its way out in slightly different ways,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.440]   but I wanted them to know that actually,
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.480]   the ground around the cross is level ground.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.240]   And then the final thing that I've really got
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.640]   from those encounters is just,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.960]   there is an openness to the gospel.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.080]   A lot of these folks that I've met certainly,
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.280]   actually they know they're lost
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.360]   and they just don't know where to look.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.880]   And obviously if you start a conversation
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.720]   with what you think about the ethics of gay sex,
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.760]   you're probably not gonna get very far.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.160]   But when I start talking about what the Bible says about,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.520]   say, identity or what the Bible says about intimacy,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.320]   I find people are really interested
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.480]   because some of it they've half sensed
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.520]   in their own experience
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.720]   that something doesn't quite add up.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.160]   And so when I talk about how the Bible shows us
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.240]   we can live without sex,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.400]   but we're not meant to live without intimacy
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.360]   and that the Bible has a much broader way
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.000]   of thinking about intimacy than we do,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.560]   people are really dialed in.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.120]   So in our culture,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.120]   we've pretty much collapsed sex and intimacy
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.440]   into each other.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.920]   So we find it very hard to conceive of intimacy
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.720]   that isn't ultimately sexual.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.840]   But the Bible shows us you can have plenty of sex
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.560]   without having intimacy.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.520]   And it also shows us you can have plenty of intimacy
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.640]   without having sex.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.360]   And I find that has a lot of students asking questions
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.880]   'cause they've sort of partially sensed some of that,
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.240]   but they've just never heard it that way before.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.520]   And actually to commend biblical wisdom to them is,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.720]   I think, so I've had some really wonderful opportunities.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.000]   So I think there is a harvest field.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.520]   My message to people who are pastors
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.480]   when it comes to issues of human sexuality
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.320]   is your job is not to duck the issue.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   Your job is not even just to hold the line,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.360]   your job is to win people.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.640]   And the gospel is good news
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.240]   in whichever area of life we apply it.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.080]   That is no less the case when we apply it
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.560]   to the issues of human sexuality.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.800]   We're giving people good news, not bad news.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.400]   And we can have great confidence in that.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.200]   So I just think we need to,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.880]   we need to have the right posture, the right tone.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   We need to go with humility and grace.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.200]   I think we need to be of service.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.480]   We need to be approaching some of these groupings
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.320]   and to say, you know, what can we do to serve you?
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.760]   How can we help?
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.160]   But I think when the initial hesitation
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.760]   and nervousness of being around Bible-believing Christians,
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.160]   when that kind of calms down,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   people, you can have some very, very fruitful conversations.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.000]   And wonderfully, there is a harvest
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.440]   within the gay community.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   And so, woe to us if we are not actually engaging
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.720]   in that task of proclaiming Christ there.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.840]   - Sam, very insightful counsel, brother.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.040]   That's a lot of practical wisdom to process
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.720]   and to think through.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.480]   Thank you for your time over these past few days.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.840]   As always, it's great to catch up with you.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.680]   - Oh, it's been my pleasure.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.920]   Thanks so much for having me, Tony.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.840]   - Anytime, Sam.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.040]   That was Sam Albury, author, speaker
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.480]   for Ravi Zacharias International Ministries
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.160]   and minister at St. Mary's Maidenhead Anglican Church
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.400]   in the UK.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.960]   He joined us from his office in Oxford.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.200]   We will return on Friday with John Piper himself.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.080]   He'll be back.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.040]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
