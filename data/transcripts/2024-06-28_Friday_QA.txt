[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.240]   We begin today with Samuel in Colorado. Samuel, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.720]   Thank you so much, Joshua. It's a privilege to be here. This is the first time I've been
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.840]   able to talk to you with that listening to your show since the beginning.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.340]   Welcome.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.920]   Yeah. I love the radical topics. Arrest proofing yourself is one that really interested me.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.420]   Wonderful.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.800]   My topic today is career and income planning.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.360]   For a long time, I've had a goal of retiring at 35 and a little background about me,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.120]   which makes that really hard. I'm currently 31 and been working in public accounting,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.640]   financial statement auditing at a big four firm for the last 10 years.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.280]   I'm a senior manager there now, making a reasonable salary for that job.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.440]   The main challenge is I want to live out also your part about living a meaningful life now as well.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.480]   My two biggest hobbies are rock climbing and skiing, and I'm not willing to give up even
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.520]   one weekend, even one day of one weekend for that, especially in the season, because there
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.400]   could be a powder day. The problem with the industry I'm in is if a client need comes up,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.120]   you're just on it. It could be weekend and you might have to give up a 20-inch powder day,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.480]   which you might only get once a year or less. I've been able to work with the firm to
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.240]   make adjustments in terms of not working weekends, but it's never a perfect solution
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.840]   because you're still often giving up your evenings. It's not a great balance,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.320]   but there is some other flexibility that comes with working with public accounting,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.760]   a lot of working from home and things like that. I'm open to the career side.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.920]   Some of the things I've thought about are consulting. There's firms that will hire
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.360]   your time out, but I've also heard people say it's better to start your own business with that,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.200]   which is more challenging. We're also just going into industry. We're also entrepreneurship,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.440]   but I know you'd probably have to give up even more of your time for that and with career.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.320]   I've thought about real estate. I don't really have the right temperament because if things
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.440]   break down, you're on the hook or you're paying someone for it. Just looking for radical ideas in
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.760]   any direction to free up my time and retire at 35. Tell me more about what your post-retirement
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.400]   lifestyle would look like, why retirement is important to you.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.440]   Good question. I think like you've mentioned in some shows, I would likely still do some
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.000]   level of work, probably part-time, but I would like the option to not have to. It really would be
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.440]   both the skiing and rock climbing that I'm doing right now, but certain things in my personal life
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.720]   have fallen to the wayside. I'm a believer going to church, so if you have to work five days a week
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   and evenings, I've gotten in the habit of skiing and rock climbing Saturday and Sunday,
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.200]   building relationships outside of work. It would be nice to be able to do it all,
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.440]   skiing and rock climbing, take trips further around the US and abroad. That stuff just
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.360]   doesn't make sense when you only have weekends. Really selfish, but also building relationships
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.520]   and spiritual. What's your current income and your current net worth?
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:41.040]   $130,000 per year and approximately $350,000. Current level of expenses,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.600]   how much do you spend normally? A very low level of expenses,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.120]   probably $1,000 per month. Are you married? Do you have children?
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.520]   I'm single, no children. Do you ever hope to marry or have children?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.600]   It's a long shot. It would be nice, but I don't meet your qualification on your show about
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.560]   the right character and the right temperament to find an excellent wife. It's unlikely.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:18.240]   The first thing I would say is – actually, one more question before I give you my comments.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.400]   Why specifically did you choose the age of 35 as your target year of retirement?
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.640]   I think it was because somewhere along – it's fairly arbitrary, but I think it was mainly
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.320]   listening to your show pretty close to the beginning. 10 years or less, it's probably
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:46.240]   around 25, so I set that goal. One more piece of context. I haven't come up with any feasible way
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.640]   to do it other than I got roped in certain points of time to network marketing with Amway. I never
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.760]   got very far into it with Worldwide Group. I know you've spoke very briefly on stuff like that.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.720]   They claim they can offer it, but I think the likelihood of achieving it with that is very low.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.840]   I thought I did a show. I've spoken about network marketing, and I can put my comments.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.520]   Yeah, you did very long ago.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.800]   All right. I probably need to do a new show because it's important that people understand
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.000]   the benefits of network marketing and the tradeoffs of network marketing. If I encapsulate
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.240]   it into probably about 60 seconds, basically, network marketing is a business just like any
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.480]   other business. It's a business with a very low success rate because most people are not suited
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.440]   to a sales business. There are legitimate network marketing businesses and illegitimate network
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.480]   marketing businesses that are just scams. You can identify a legitimate network marketing business
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.000]   based upon the percentage of time spent selling product as compared to the time spent recruiting
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.960]   people into your downline. A legitimate business will always guide people towards doing direct
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.080]   sales selling product. The problem is that generally the products that you sell in a direct
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:08.000]   sales business are generally low commission products. There's not a lot of money into them,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.480]   which is what pushes most people over to recruiting a downline.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.560]   If you're comparing network marketing to other direct sales opportunities,
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.320]   if you find out that I like selling stuff and I'm good at selling stuff,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.520]   then you would almost always be better off just going and getting a real sales job.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.480]   Go and sell airplanes, or go and sell cars, or go and sell insurance, or go and sell something
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.760]   directly that has a much bigger price tag and a much bigger model or much bigger ticket price
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   than selling in direct sales and network marketing. Similarly, if you flip over to
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.520]   recruiting in the downline, that's where the big money in network marketing is. You build a big
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.880]   downline and you become a trainer. Once again, if you're good at these skills, then these are skills
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.240]   that can be applied in all kinds of traditional businesses. You can build out a great sales
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.880]   business. You can start an insurance agency. You can do all kinds of things and you have a much
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.400]   higher earning potential in those businesses than you have in network marketing. If I'm actually
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.120]   coaching somebody, then very rarely do I point to network marketing as the best expression of it,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.160]   where network marketing has usually gotten its legs has just been from people who either can't
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.240]   access the traditional marketplace. Somebody might have a felony or have children and providing
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.680]   childcare or time with mom and dad, or they can't go away to a traditional job, or they can't get
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.600]   hired in a traditional job, or they just simply don't have the ambitions desired for that and
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.040]   they just want to do a little bit here and there and make a few hundred dollars. That's fine.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.120]   So as long as you're dealing with something where you're actually selling product and not opportunity,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.560]   then it's legitimate, but it's just not the best. It's not the best option when someone has those
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:58.240]   skills and then it is not in any way per passive income. So I try to restrict exclusively the
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.560]   concept of passive income exclusively to expressions of basically living on dividends from
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:13.040]   public companies rather than earning money that's recurring revenue. It's fine to have
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.920]   recurring revenue. It's wonderful, but it's not passive income. So that was 120 seconds,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.680]   but it's important to say that with regard to network marketing. So I would like to point...
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.880]   Go ahead. Oh, I was just going to say thanks for that context. Yeah. And I can expand that
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.360]   into a... I've meant to do a show on that for a while and expand the points with more evidence,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.120]   but that's the outline of it. To the age of 35, I would say, first of all, it's important
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.160]   that you recognize that this is an arbitrary number. Arbitrary numbers are extremely useful
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:49.040]   as mental exercises. They're not so useful in real life planning. And so it's good to say,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.200]   "Hey, how could I become financially independent in four years?" And that's why you're calling me
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.760]   and what we're talking about. But in terms of your actual life planning, it sounds to me like
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.880]   if you could be financially independent today at 31, then you'd take that because it would give
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.000]   you more powder time, more rock face time. On the other hand, if you reach it at 37,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.400]   okay, big deal. It's not that... There's nothing materially different about your life between 35
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:19.760]   and 37. So step one, I would say, if you continue on your current trajectory, what do you project
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.800]   would be your financial independence date? Using a 4% rule, what would be your current
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:31.680]   projection at your current job, current trajectory? That's the thing. Unless I make a change,
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.760]   because I just got promoted to senior manager and at best people will get promoted to managing
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.640]   director six to eight years. But I'm a white male, so I don't check any of the DEI boxes for this big
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   four. Just check the boxes. Just check the boxes. There's no point ever in identifying
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.360]   as a white male. So just check the boxes. It doesn't matter. Anyway, go on.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.160]   But yeah, I was going to say, and I don't think I even want to be a managing director from what
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.720]   I've seen for those I work with. The higher you go in my organization, the less freedom you have
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.560]   now. You just have to give up the weekends. You just have to give up everything and you have to
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.160]   give up all the other hobbies. Like you said with selling, selling the business has to matter. It
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.440]   has to be your life. So it's kind of like a point of stagnation. I think I can probably get five to
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:32.560]   10% raises every year, which are pretty good, better than probably average. But that being said,
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.360]   I think a million might be reasonable for me with the 4% rule, just because I can keep my expenses
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:45.840]   so low. So maybe I could do it in five to 10 years, probably more like 20, because I still enjoy
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.280]   traveling with gas, driving eight hours on a weekend to ski at Salt Lake City,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.640]   or based in Denver. So I would say, yeah, maybe 15 years.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.960]   - Okay. So it's important that you have an idea of what your current baseline is.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.560]   And if you're not willing to give up your weekends today, then you're not a good candidate for an
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.840]   aggressive plan. And the first thing to focus on is the fact that, hey, listen, I can just,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.640]   as I say every show, I can build a life I don't want to retire from. Working a job is not
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:25.920]   particularly burdensome. It's really not. And so your first step, what I always coach people in,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.720]   is first, try to build a job that you don't necessarily want to retire from. Now, maybe
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.080]   public accounting has too much variability in your schedule, and that's not for you. Well,
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.520]   go and get a job working as a flight attendant, right? You'll take a big pay cut, but now you're
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.560]   going to have a standard schedule, and you can, okay, you can't ski all the good powder days
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.800]   because you're going to be working, but go and just take a job. Just have some kind of job where
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.200]   you go and work and are done with work when you're done with it. Or go and get a job in a mountain
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.440]   town. Move from wherever you are to a little mountain town, get a job at a ski shop as a
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:08.240]   front desk manager or something like that, and now you can put a sign on the door that says
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.120]   closed for powder when there's good powder, and you can be off on the weekends every time.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.760]   Now, it sounds like I'm being flippant. I'm not being flippant. I'm trying to say
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.720]   that if you abandon the idea of first and foremost trying to build a plan for financial
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.240]   independence in the short term, and you start building your plans around building a life you
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.720]   don't want to retire from first, then you'll be able to accomplish your goals of having your
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.280]   weekends available, having your evenings available, things like that. I lead every
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.000]   show with building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. It's been a while since I've
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.440]   addressed that tagline. I intentionally chose the term freedom rather than financial independence
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.320]   because I mean freedom, not financial independence. As far as I'm concerned,
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:03.200]   you're financially free today, and how I would define that to say that you can go and do just
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.560]   about anything that you want to do. There is no lifestyle change that is today outside of your
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:14.160]   grasp. There is no career change that is today outside of your grasp. There's no geographic move
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.960]   that is today outside of your grasp. There's no business that today, if you wanted to start it,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.760]   is outside of your grasp. You have achieved financial freedom in, let's say, six years.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.400]   If you started listening to me when you were 25, you've achieved financial freedom in six years.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.360]   But using the definition that you have all choices available to you, any choices available to you,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.280]   you can even stop working by my calculations with a $350,000 net worth. I wish I could get
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.000]   my calculator fixed because I always freeze up when doing math verbally aloud over the radio.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.640]   Right now, you have a total net worth of 29 years of freedom. If you have $350,000 net worth and
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.520]   you have $12,000 of annual expenses, you have 29 years of freedom. That's what you've bought
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.920]   yourself right now. You haven't bought yourself a lifetime of freedom, but you've bought yourself
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.160]   29 years of freedom based upon your savings. I'm ignoring investment growth, anything like that,
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:14.480]   just simply dividing $350,000 by $12,000. That's a huge, huge amount of financial freedom. If you
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.240]   want to take a year off, take five years off. All of these things are available to you.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.800]   The only choice you don't currently have available to you, based upon what you're describing,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.600]   is the choice to never work again the rest of your life. Now, could you get there in the next
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.280]   four years? You absolutely could, but I don't think you're willing to and I don't think you
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.040]   should. Could you do it? Yes, if you worked like a maniac and you took the highest paying job
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.080]   possible and you continued to live on $1,000 a month, which would be very unusual and you were
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.520]   completely committed to working all the time and making as much money as possible. You have your
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.440]   day job, you're working extra at your day job, all kinds of overtime, and you pick up something
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.160]   else on the side. Maybe you attend bar at nights and on weekends or have some other kind of high
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.440]   paying gig job that you do. Then you could increase your income and you could get yourself on track to
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:10.160]   be financially independent at 35. But you haven't articulated the goal to me that would make that
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.720]   make any sense. A goal would be like, "Okay, I'm going to buy a sailboat and spend the next 10
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.640]   years sailing the world." So I would say that instead of 35, why don't you stretch it out in
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:28.960]   your mind to 45 or 50 and say, "All right, I'm on track for early retirement at 45 or 50." When I
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.640]   do this work in private consulting, you could do your numbers yourself. But usually the first thing
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.200]   I do is say, "Let's assume that you stopped saving money and take your current expenses and calculate
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.920]   the year at which you would be able to live exclusively from the growth of your portfolio
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.800]   based upon a normal expected growth and calculate the year at which if you stopped
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:58.240]   contributing today, you would be able to live on your desired lifestyle." I'm not going to do the
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:04.320]   math right now, but take that number and grow it. Then usually what I'll say is the next question or
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.680]   next thing is, "How can you design a life that would be appropriate for you between today and
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.880]   that day in the future?" So let's say at 31 years old with a net worth of $350,000, let's say you
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.120]   calculate it and you say, "All right, if I don't save another dime, but I keep my full $350,000
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:28.720]   invested for the next 17 years, at that point in time, my portfolio, assuming 7% growth rate,
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.440]   my portfolio would grow to be enough to cover my lifestyle. Then I'll be fine, right? Because
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.840]   that's the benefit of saving super aggressively is that the numbers are going to get very huge
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:43.680]   in 15 or 20 years. So now then let's bring it back to a different problem and let's solve a
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.440]   much easier problem, which is, "How can I build a life or lifestyle over the next 17 years that
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.520]   I'm really comfortable with?" What I'll usually challenge somebody with is simply to say,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:01.040]   "Here are the rules. Rule number one is you cannot spend any money from your investments.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.720]   You cannot take any money from what you have saved or invested."
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.640]   Enter a new era of color and brilliance with Vizio's Quantum Pro 4K QLED Smart TV.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.120]   With over a billion hues of vibrant color, plus wide viewing angle and anti-glare film,
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.160]   it delivers perfect clear picture no matter where you're sitting. It even comes with over 300 free
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.280]   TV channels and thousands of on-demand titles with Vizio Watch Free Plus. And of course,
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.880]   all your favorite apps are built in, so you can start blasting your favorite music,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.320]   radio, and podcasts from iHeart Radio straight out the box.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.440]   Head to walmart.com to find the Vizio Quantum Pro today.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:45.040]   Rule number two, you can no longer save any money. So if you're content living on $1,000 a month,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.320]   all you got to earn is $1,000 a month. And you can earn that in any number of jobs
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.120]   that are perfectly compatible with the lifestyle that you envision for yourself.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:02.720]   So go and find a job that pays you enough to live on. And the rule is you can't spend any money from
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.760]   savings, but you can't save any money. So now you can kind of think about building a different
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:15.520]   lifestyle. Now the biggest X factor in your situation is going to be whether or not you
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.920]   ever marry and whether or not you ever have children. So I think you're probably self-aware
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:27.040]   to know that it is exceedingly unusual for someone to live on $1,000 a month. I think that you can do
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:32.080]   it. You can live comfortably on $1,000 a month if you're devoted to some kind of alternative
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:38.320]   lifestyle. And being some dirtbag out sleeping in your car by the cliffs is a perfectly reasonable
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.840]   lifestyle as being a ski bum sleeping in your car for fresh powder. You're in good company
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.200]   with the ability to live inexpensively there. But the big unknown is going to be if you ever
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.280]   changed your family situation and were responsible for supporting other people.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.920]   So just be aware that you should keep flexibility in your plans. Until or unless you decide, "No,
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.640]   I'm never going to marry no matter what," then you should have a couple of plans. You should have
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.160]   plan A, which would be your single plan, and plan B, which would be your married plan. And ideally
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.640]   you would have a version of those that you're comfortable with. And by the way, to be clear,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.080]   you don't need to marry somebody who's high maintenance. There's lots of people out there
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   that you can find that are comfortable living really inexpensively. One of my favorite Twitter
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.880]   followers these days, I don't know his name, he goes on Twitter by something like Shagman Burke.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:32.000]   I think you could find him with that. Super interesting writer. He just got married,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.680]   but all during his 20s, he was a hitchhiker, just basically a homeless bum, hitchhiking
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:44.080]   left, right, and center across the United States. Fascinating guy, enormous interest,
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:53.040]   very interesting guy. But he found a girl who was totally acceptable with his very non-mainstream
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.000]   lifestyle, and they seemed happy couple ever, hoping to have a baby soon, and they just got
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   married and seemed super happy and super content. So that can just be one of the things is that you
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.120]   want to marry some dirtbag rock climber, and perfect, she's a great fit for you, and that's
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   just part of how you live together. There's lots of women out there who would accept that,
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.440]   but most people find that the hyper hardcore extreme savings doesn't work for the long term.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.920]   So coming back to the point, number one, recognize that your number is arbitrary.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.320]   Number two, you're probably not going to be willing to do what's necessary to hit the
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.360]   arbitrary number. You said it to me already, you said, "I don't want to work weekends." Okay, fine.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.200]   Well, you're not going to get rich fast and be truly financially independent in a very short
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.640]   period of time without really going crazy. And I don't see any reason why you really need to go
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:49.120]   crazy. So what I would say is calculate the age at which, based upon your current savings, you can
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.520]   consider yourself fully financially independent based on portfolio growth. And then go back and
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:01.680]   say, "What could be a lifestyle that would allow me to live the kind of lifestyle that I really
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:07.040]   like living that's just sufficient?" I've known plenty of accountants over the years that just
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.640]   did seasonal work. They just did tax preparation. They just did seasonal work with a small handful
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.880]   of clients that they had themselves. They weren't making as much as you're earning. They weren't
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.040]   making top figures. They weren't trying to make partner. They just wanted to make enough money
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.240]   to support themselves. And they made $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year with part-time remote
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.040]   work, very seasonal, and that gave them the flexibility that they had. So that would harm
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.600]   your ability to be financially independent at 35, but it would fulfill your goal of having every
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:42.720]   weekend free between now and then and beyond. So that's where I would spend a lot of time
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:49.520]   thinking through the options to consider if there's just an alternate vision. It is a lot easier for
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:56.400]   you to get a different job with different features that are more attractive to you than it is for you
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.720]   to retire from working at all. And that's the thing that changed me off of the financial independence
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:09.920]   retire early plan. What I now see is that when I was obsessed with firing at a young age,
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.920]   I was obsessed with it because I didn't like my job. And I have found that it's a lot easier for
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.960]   me to get a job that I like more than to go and become financially independent, especially with
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.560]   all of the uncertainties of long-term financial projections and things like that. So keep on
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:33.040]   saving money, but spend some serious time finding and thinking of a job that you would like more
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.600]   that would provide you with the attributes of life that you're looking for before you go crazy
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:45.760]   just focusing on being financially independent at age 35. Thank you so much. That's a lot to
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.560]   think of and I'll call back in the future and refine in some other topics. I would love it
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.480]   if you did. That would be wonderful. Tyler in Missouri, welcome to the show. How can I serve
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:08.160]   you today? Tyler, that's you. You're already unmuted. Go ahead, Tyler. Going once. I'll come
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.800]   back to you, Tyler. It looks like you're having some trouble with your mute. I'll come back to
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.320]   you in a minute. Marcus in Pennsylvania, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, Marcus?
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.840]   Hey, Mr. Sheets. How are you? Very well, sir. Welcome.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.920]   Well, thank you. So I'm in a bit of a bind and my career has been kind of offset by a year.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.840]   I'm wondering if, after what I'm going to tell you, if there's any other recommendations that
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.200]   you would recommend or anything that I'm overlooking. So I'm a recently graduated
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:44.960]   physician from medical school a month ago and I didn't match into residency this year. There's a
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:52.400]   bunch of stuff going on all throughout 2024. And I'm kind of wondering, is there any way to
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:59.600]   make up for, you know, the lost potential future income and the opportunity cost of not being a
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:07.920]   physician for a year? And how can I kind of make the most of this year, both financially? Am I
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.160]   able to do some of the things that I wanted to do later in my career, such as take a year off and
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:21.280]   travel, get an MBA, et cetera? And how can I best accomplish that without losing out too much?
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.560]   Why do you think you didn't match? I don't need all the details, but broadly speaking.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.000]   So emergency medicine was especially competitive this year compared to the past two years.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.360]   And because of my board scores, I don't think I made it past a few filters.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.240]   I passed, but I just, I very lowly passed on my step to the boards.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.920]   And then when I went back over my application, you know, I was going through a breakup at the time
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:54.480]   and my application was not refined. It was kind of unfocused. I had just torn my pectoralis major
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.720]   and I had surgery. There was just a lot going on. I'm driving on the Uber on the weekend so
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:07.760]   that I can make ends meet to cover what student loans won't cover. So it was just, I think,
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.360]   multifactorial. Okay. And pardon my ignorance. I know a lot about physician finances and very,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:19.360]   not very little about how to actually be a physician. Is matching for a residency program,
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.680]   is that something that will only happen once a year, or is there a possibility that something
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.040]   can open up in the middle of the year? It's very uncommon that something opens up
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:36.160]   in the middle of the year. And there's the match process through NLMP, the National Residency Match
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.800]   Program. And that takes place, applications, I think, open up in September through this program
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:49.760]   called ERAS. And then you start the interview trail, like, what is it, like November, December,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:56.880]   into like January and February. And then match day is early in March. So that's kind of where
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:03.760]   you find out. And then there's the supplemental process called the SOAP, where if you didn't
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:11.600]   match somewhere on Monday, they send you a list of all the open unfilled slots. So I had 10 interviews
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.880]   in two days. And then you find on Thursday, if you're getting any offers throughout four different
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.760]   rounds of extending offers, and that didn't happen this year. Is there an opportunity to retake your
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.000]   exams and score more highly? So that's what I've been looking into. If I can take step three of the
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.800]   USMLE without having, step three would be the next step. If I can do that without having
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.680]   an intern year completed, intern year would be the first year of residency.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:48.320]   So I'm not the right person to ask about the specifics of the application process. So what
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:55.280]   I want to articulate that could be useful is simply a frame of mind. You still want to be a physician,
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:00.800]   right? Correct. Okay. Yes. So if you want to be a physician and you know, I want to be an emergency
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.080]   room physician, and you've done all this work to get to this point, then you really shouldn't be
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:12.400]   worrying or thinking or paying any attention to plan B. You should be completely focused on plan
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.280]   A. Because the guy who's completely focused on plan A, he knows what he wants and he's going to
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:23.200]   do what's necessary to get there. That's the guy who a year from now is going to be placed back on
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.160]   track with all of the normal stuff. Getting knocked off track is no big deal. That's normal.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.720]   You had a bunch of stuff that happened. Okay, great. What's necessary is that you have to learn
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:40.000]   from it and you have to be an overcomer. And so in the American culture, especially, we don't look
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.040]   down on people ever who get knocked off track. We love hero stories, but we only look up to them
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.800]   when they have fixed their problems. So we don't have any cultural sense of
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.520]   failure being permanence. That's why our culture is so built around somebody goes through bankruptcy
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.440]   a couple of times, no big deal. We will still honor that person as the greatest businessman
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.640]   in the world once he's rebuilt things. But we only accept people who are successful.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.120]   So if you still are down and you're just continuing to fail out and you're sitting
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.360]   at home and moping about how you're depressed, we don't want to hear about it. So what I would say
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:22.640]   is you need to be, from an attitudinal perspective, you need to be laser focused on saying, "That
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.800]   sucked. Last year sucked. I screwed it all up. I didn't score well. I didn't interview well. I
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.960]   didn't write good essays, and this has to change." So then by this time next year, if you can change
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:40.640]   that stuff and you'll be a victor and it'll come into your essays, and 20 years from now when
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.480]   you're accepting some fancy award for some prestigious breakthrough or service or whatever,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.800]   then you'll say, "You know, the biggest challenge of my life was when I didn't get matched to
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.680]   residency and how humiliating that was because I screwed it all up and I had a breakup and blah,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.080]   blah, blah, whatever it was." And then you'll inspire the next league of our culture who will
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.160]   go on and continue what we do of praising the underdog story. So my point is just recognize
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.280]   where you are in the story. "Well, that sucked. I've got kicked in the teeth. I didn't get what
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.920]   I wanted." But recognize now you have to do the hard work to fix the things that were wrong.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.200]   And so if you know you want to be a physician and you know, "I want to be an emergency room
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.800]   physician," then you have to pull apart every single reason why you didn't get matched,
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.440]   and then you have to work like a maniac to fix those things. And the good thing is they're all
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:34.400]   fixable with specific coaching, with specific practice, with specific dedication and effort.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.640]   So if you didn't score well on an exam, then you have to go back and you have to say,
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.280]   "Why didn't I score well?" And so you need to learn about learning, take a look at your scores,
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.160]   figure out what didn't work well, what was broken in my test preparation process. Now,
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.120]   I'm not interested in the details here. It could be that you just were so distraught over your
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.000]   emotional life and you were up late arguing and blah, blah, blah, and you just needed more sleep.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.240]   All right, we'll fix it. But it could be that you really need to be focused on going through the
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:08.000]   knowledge and really mastering it. And the thing about academics is by the third or fourth time
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.360]   you go through the class, it should be pretty easy for you. You've passed all of the intellectual
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:19.200]   screens necessary to be confident of your basic ability. You're not stupid. You're not incapable
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:25.280]   of learning. So obviously you're capable of passing this exam. It just might be that you
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.360]   need to be the guy who goes through the material four times when all your classmates went through
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:35.520]   it twice and that was no big deal. So again, this can be reworked into part of your story.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:42.400]   And you can take every failure and every setback and recast it as a success. And I failed that
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.840]   exam. That didn't work out well. So I dedicated the next six months to studying like crazy,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.560]   and I passed the exam. And by the way, even if there's not an official metric for this,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.320]   and I don't know anything about the step in the USMLE process, but even if there's not an official
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.760]   metric for this, what I would do is I would say, "I didn't do well on the boards," or whatever,
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:10.880]   "on the exam." So if I can't retake the exam officially, then I'll retake the exam unofficially.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.360]   I'll find somebody to proctor an official version of the exam, and I'll get a good score,
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.040]   and I'll have that notarized, and I'll take that to my interviews, and they'll say,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.200]   "Why did you do so badly on the exam?" And I'll say, "Well, I did really badly on the exam
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.240]   because I was going through this, and I didn't know this, and I didn't know the other thing,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.920]   but I fixed it. And by the way, here's my form. Here's my notarized affidavit by so-and-so who
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.000]   proctored my exam and said that I scored brilliantly after really focusing on it."
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.080]   And you may be able to do that with going ahead and doing well on step three.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.400]   So you need to pull apart all of the academic process, figure out and identify and diagnose,
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.960]   "Why did I not do well? And now I have to figure out how to do well. So if I don't know how to
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.920]   study, then let me go and get more coaching on studying. Let me go and improve the issues."
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.360]   Similarly, "Why didn't I interview well?" Because if you had interviewed better,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.440]   then probably there would have been a better spot. So you may need to do some really focused
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:08.160]   planning and practice related to your interview skills and figure out, "How do I improve my
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.880]   interview skills? Maybe I need to do more practice interviews, more coaching."
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.360]   And it might be something that some individual can mentor you with. It might be something that
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.400]   you're just talking to chat GPT all the time, and you're having chat throw at you tons and tons of
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.040]   interview questions until you're really, really calm. And anything else that could have impacted
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.400]   essay questions, you might need coaching on your writing. And so you need to hire a coach and work
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   on it and read some books on how to write better essays and really think about the package that
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.640]   you're presenting because all of these are influential and anything else that you can
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.440]   identify that would improve the process. So my point is that if you know the direction
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.880]   you want to go, then express the determination to not be denied. And there's a good chance that
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:56.000]   you were right on the edge. Your scores were just a little bit lower than they should have been.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.200]   The field had this year a larger number of qualified candidates. Maybe there weren't quite
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.240]   as many vacancies in the industry as expected, but next year it could be totally different,
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.440]   or two years from now it could be totally different. So that would be my primary focus
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.280]   rather than moving on to anything else would just be to say, "How do I stay put on plan A?"
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.400]   And in the fullness of time, in the fullness of your life, being a year behind getting into your
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.280]   career or three years behind or whatever it is, whatever it winds up being, it's not going to be
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:34.000]   that big of a deal. So let me pause there. Do you think that's a decent start psychologically for
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:42.320]   you to work from? Yeah, absolutely. Especially as far as the academics and the exams and the
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:51.600]   application process is concerned. Supporting myself financially over the next year is my next
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.240]   thing to solve. I've been applying to jobs left and rights. My undergrad is in mechanical
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:05.040]   engineering. I'm struggling to find jobs in engineering. I'm driving Uber right now
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:13.200]   while applying to jobs as a server at high-end restaurants. And I'm wondering if I'm looking,
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.880]   overlooking anything that will be minimally time intensive to give me that time to study and
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:26.240]   prepare and do more research over the next year and volunteer and keep my clinical skills sharp
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:34.160]   while I'm supporting myself and my dog. Yeah. Well, I was just going to ask, it sounded like
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.920]   there might've been a baby there with you. Are you supporting a family or are you a single man?
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:44.320]   I'm a single man. Okay. So the good thing is that other... So are your student loans in deferral?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.920]   They are. 300,000. Okay. And can you keep them in deferral for at least the next year or two?
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:37:04.320]   I believe that I can. Worst case scenario, I do income-based loan repayment. Okay. So first goal
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:13.200]   is keep your loans in deferral if at all possible. Then the second way to handle your money is you
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.520]   need to go as absolutely cheaply as possible with your living expenses. Are you living alone? Are
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.960]   you living with family or friends? What's your living situation right now? I'm living alone,
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:30.000]   but my last rent payment is August and then I'm going to move back in with my parents 20 minutes
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.600]   away. Perfect. Perfect. So that's exactly what you need to do. Move in with your parents.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:40.000]   The easiest way that your family can support you at this stage is to give you a place to
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.080]   live rent-free and that'll be wonderful. Remember that the only reason that you wouldn't want to do
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:56.000]   that is simply if you're just basically a loser bum. That's the only problem. But you're not a
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.200]   loser bum and you're not going to be a loser bum. And so if you can move in with your parents and
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.720]   live there rent-free or with just a very token amount, then that should eliminate the financial
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:13.840]   pressure from living expenses. And then everything else is pretty simple. You should easily be able
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.880]   to live on some hundreds of dollars a month, especially if you have low rent, and that you
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:24.160]   can absolutely cover with any kind of gig that's just enough to cover your expenses. You have to
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.360]   stay focused on the big goal, which is getting placed as a physician. Because once you get
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.120]   through residency and once you get out of residency, the financial problems will be fixed.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:41.440]   So this is just a short-term thing. It doesn't require some huge transition. And the most
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:47.840]   reasonable way to do this as a single man is to be hardcore about your expenses and be really
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:54.080]   dedicating yourself to study and to all the stuff that I've said. Now, is there a job that would
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:00.480]   enhance your hireability as a physician? For example, something related to an emergency room
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.680]   nurse or something related to EMS or anything like that, would any of that stuff improve your hiring
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:16.240]   attractiveness? I believe so. You just brought up EMS. I haven't even looked in the process of what
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:22.640]   getting that EMT certification looks like, but that would definitely keep me clinical and push
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:28.400]   me closer to matching next year. That would be what I would love to do. So I think we could solve,
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.920]   based upon just a broad thing. Other than your student loans, do you have a lot of other debt,
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.440]   personal debt, credit card debt, anything like that? I have $3,500 of credit card debt
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:46.640]   from my surgery that I just kind of put the last month of the semester on credit cards.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.320]   Okay. So goal number one is keep your student loans in deferral. Goal number two is cut your
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.360]   living expenses to basically zero. Tell mom and dad the situation. Make sure they understand.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:02.800]   Make sure they understand what you're doing. Your parents want to help you and they want to support
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.880]   you. Their only concern will be, are you actually working on a plan, working towards a goal,
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.480]   or are you living like a bum? If they see that you're working on a plan and you recognize this
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.160]   didn't work out last year the way that it was supposed to, but a year from now I'm going to be
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:24.560]   employed as a physician or a resident, then your mom and dad will be happy to give you a room to
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.360]   live in. They'll be happy to feed you. They'll be thrilled to do that. It'll be a great time for you
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.760]   to be at the table and they can feed you. They'll be happy to put you on their cell phone plan.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:43.520]   They'll be happy to cover your expenses. Now, you have to make certain that you're bearing your own
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:49.200]   weight. So if your mom and dad are paying for all of your expenses as an adult man, then you need to
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.480]   be making certain that you're doing a lot at the house to help. But I wouldn't be scared to accept
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.920]   charity from your parents because they want you to succeed. And so if what's necessary for you to
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.600]   succeed is for them to cover all your living expenses while you study 14 hours a day and you
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.560]   network and you do everything that you can, they're going to be happy to do that. I would do it for my
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:15.920]   adult son. If you're a father someday, you will do it for your child because you see that in the long
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.360]   run, this is the best pathway. So if you have a job and you go and get a job and you're waiting
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.520]   tables or you're driving for Uber and you're making some money, of course that's fine. But
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:32.480]   you can only do that with time that's not going to invade your primary plan. You can only do that
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:39.200]   when you can still study effectively. You can't be out late, you know, tending bar somewhere and then
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.560]   not be able to study the next day. Your focus needs to be getting the academic stuff solved,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:51.040]   the essay stuff solved, really hardcore, so that this time next year you are a resident and
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:42:00.160]   everything else should be in subjection to that. I wouldn't try to go for anything more creative
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.400]   than that because if you go off and you start hiking the Appalachian Trail because you think
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   that would be fun, that's just going to destroy your studying, you're going to get rusty, you're
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.840]   going to do terrible on your exams. All of that stuff is going to be an impediment to the advancement
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.320]   of your career and you need to make certain that you recoup the investment of years of your life
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:26.880]   and $300,000 at this point in time. If the job in, say, working as an EMT or some kind of orderly in
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:33.680]   a hospital, if that job is going to get you closer to the goal, then you should do it. Not primarily
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.560]   for money. You don't just need money. Again, sounds like your parents can support you for a year,
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.720]   but you should do it because it'll help you get closer to the job. It'll keep you current,
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.920]   it'll allow you to exercise your knowledge, it'll help you to build relationships.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:51.200]   Those relationships may pay off in a match in the future. They may create better endorsements
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.320]   by people who are going to write letters of recommendation for you. If there's an EMT job
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.560]   or an orderly job or something that you could get hired for around the medical business that would
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:05.120]   get you closer to the goal, then that's what I would do. Make certain that you're not neglecting
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.440]   the academics. >> Right on. Thank you so much.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.480]   >> My pleasure. Anything else? >> No, that's it. Thank you.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.280]   >> All right. Keep in touch and let us know how things go in the coming year. I'd love to hear
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.960]   back from you. Tyler in Missouri, back to you. >> Can you hear me now, Josh?
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:23.200]   >> Sounds good. Go ahead, sir. >> Great. Thanks. I have a question for you,
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.800]   life insurance-based. I'm actually asking on behalf of a relative of mine. He ended up getting
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:35.920]   a $500,000, 65-plus full life policy, and he's basically looking to get out of it. I just thought
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.080]   I would ask you what your recommendation was before he pulls that trigger, because I've heard
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:46.160]   on previous episodes you've advised certain things. I have a little bit of information from him. Let
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.000]   me know what you need. >> When did he get the policy?
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.600]   >> About three years ago. >> All right. If it's three years ago,
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.080]   then there's no—the reason I ask, let me just explain for anyone else who needs to learn.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.760]   First of all, anytime you buy a life insurance policy, there are always a variety of options
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.720]   available with it. During the time that you're in underwriting, you can cancel the policy.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.240]   Anytime that you buy a life insurance policy, once the policy is delivered in every state in
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:20.160]   the United States, you have some form of free-look period. It used to be two weeks in some states.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.640]   Now it's 30 days. Basically, anywhere from a couple weeks to a month, depending on the state,
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:30.400]   you have a free-look period. We're not in any of those options, but that's why I ask.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.200]   With a three-year-old policy, we're going to be focusing on the non-forfeiture
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:42.000]   benefits. The face amount of the policy is $500,000. What's his premium,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.520]   and what's the current cash value? >> The premium is $625,000 a month.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.000]   The surrender value is $4,900. I'm not sure if that's probably a lower amount than the
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.160]   cash value would be, my guess. >> Yeah. Why does he want to get rid of it?
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.840]   It's just an albatross. He got talked into it. At the time when he opened it,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:08.320]   he was making roughly a little under $100,000. He wants to put it in something that's a higher
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.160]   yield return. I think he got talked into it for retirement purposes. He really has,
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:16.240]   from my understanding, no need for life insurance. He's a single guy, no kids, not married.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:21.120]   >> Instead of putting money in a Roth IRA, instead of putting money in 401(k),
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.680]   he opened a whole life policy. >> Right.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:31.280]   >> Okay. It's a little bit tricky at this stage of the policy life where he needs to think about it.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:37.120]   First of all, the big problem with whole life insurance is simply that the short-term cash
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:43.840]   returns are pretty bad. If he cancels the policy now, he will lose the majority of his money
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:49.200]   because all of the expenses of a life insurance policy are all front-loaded. In the first year,
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.120]   you really accumulate almost no cash value in a whole life policy. In the second year,
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.800]   you're a little bit better. Third year, okay, we're back on track now,
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.280]   but it takes a number of years before the policy breaks even.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.440]   First thing we want to do is understand the numbers. We want to understand the total amount
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:10.080]   of money that he's put in in terms of premium cost. We want to understand the current cash
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.000]   surrender value. You've stated those numbers. We can calculate 36 months at whatever it was,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.800]   the monthly payment, and we can figure out where he is. The next thing we want to do is we want to
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:25.120]   look at what would be the alternative use of the dollar and what would be the break-even point in
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:33.280]   the policy. The alternative use of the dollar is really important. What a lot of people will do
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.880]   is they'll do something like buy a life insurance policy. They'll have regrets. Say, "I want to
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.080]   cancel it." He'll cancel it, but if he doesn't go on and save any money and he doesn't start putting
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.560]   the money into a better investment, then it's going to wind up being a bad decision for him.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:51.280]   We don't compound a previous bad decision with a new bad decision. I've seen this happen lots
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.800]   of times. A guy will have a life insurance policy. He says, "Well, you know, I should have bought
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.000]   term and invest the difference. My life insurance agent ripped me off because he sold me this whole
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.680]   life policy that was inappropriate for me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." Cancels the policy three
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.000]   years later, has no money because he's not saving anything. We want to make sure that doesn't
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.400]   happen. We want to get clear on what is the alternative use of the dollar. The second thing
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.480]   we want to look at is, is there a way that he can continue doing it? You said the premium was how
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:24.000]   much? $560,000 a month? $625,000. $625,000 a month. If he's got $100,000 income at $625,000...
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.840]   His income has increased since then, but just at the time. He's at about $150,000 range right now.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.600]   Okay. $7,500 a year of premium, that would be... You said he's at $150,000 now?
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:41.200]   Yes. That would be about 5% of his income going into this policy, something like that. Is that
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:48.080]   right? Correct. Okay. It probably was inappropriate when he bought it. He had a lot of motivation to
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:54.000]   buy lots and get really rich, but he probably could make that payment if he wanted to. I
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.040]   understand he doesn't want to, but he could make the payment today if he wanted to, right?
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.960]   Correct. Okay. If he's a single guy and he's good with his finances, he could do all of the above.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:08.080]   If he's making $150,000, he could max out his 401(k), he could put money into a backdoor Roth
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.440]   IRA, and he could make this life insurance payment and still be okay. Agreed? Agreed.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.960]   Okay. Let's not just dump it willy-nilly. Let's make an accurate assessment.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.440]   Just because something... That's why I'm calling you.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.560]   Perfect. Yeah. I'm pointing this out for people because it's like this. Somebody says, "I married
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.040]   the wrong woman." Okay. "I married the wrong woman." We can acknowledge the fact that you
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.200]   married the wrong woman, but does that mean necessarily that you should immediately divorce
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:41.360]   her? Well, that's a different question. The fact is you are married. There's a balance between
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:47.120]   engaging in fallacious thinking with a sunk cost fallacy versus making a fresh decision to say,
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:54.160]   "Here's where I'm at." There's lots of people who "married the wrong woman" who turn out to have a
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.440]   great life and have a great and rewarding marriage because they recognize, "If I had to do it over
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.080]   again, I would do things differently when I got started, but hey, here I am." When I approach a
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:09.360]   question like you're asking me, I do the same thing. Okay. Maybe there was inappropriate buying
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:14.240]   pressure. Maybe I was susceptible to it, but at the end of the day, let me not just say, "Well,
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:20.480]   I made a mistake then." Let me do a fresh analysis now and say, "Is this suitable for me now?"
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.880]   And from what you're describing, using purely the technical language of suitability,
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:32.000]   this policy would not necessarily be unsuitable for him today. He has the capacity to pay the
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.920]   premium. He has the capacity to fund those other things. The big question is, is there an
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:43.600]   alternative investment for him that is superior to the money that he's putting into this policy,
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:51.520]   especially given the fact that now all of the costs of the policy are paid? Once you get into,
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.600]   say, the third year of a policy, then now we can calculate, "Hey, this year I'm going to make a
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   premium payment of $625 a month, but maybe now my rate of return on cash value is higher because
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.320]   I've already paid all the commissions and the expenses." So he should be doing a fresh analysis
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:12.880]   now. Now, if he weren't putting the $625 of premium payments today, what specifically would
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:19.200]   he do with the money? He'd probably just invest it in the stock market. I know that he's already
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.680]   maxing out his Roth 401(k) at work, and he's just been putting extra money in the stock market.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:30.640]   Not necessarily mutual funds, but something similar. All right. So here's where our argument
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:37.360]   gets a little bit tricky. I think that in the fullness of time, if I have to put my money
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:44.720]   on which investment is going to turn out bigger, in the fullness of time, I would bet that if he
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.120]   put $625 a month into something like a stock market index fund, as compared to the life
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:56.640]   insurance policy, I'm of the conviction that the stock market index fund will probably do
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:04.480]   better in the long run with the $625 a month. So I think the stock market will outperform
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:11.360]   life insurance. The reason I think that is simply that the life insurance portfolio is all invested
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:18.160]   in fixed income investments and very stable, very safe investments. And in general, higher risk asset
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:25.360]   classes like stocks should outperform lower volatility asset classes like fixed income.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.680]   Otherwise, what's the point of the whole stock market in the beginning? All of us would take
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:35.280]   an entire fixed income portfolio if it would return us higher than the volatility of the
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.880]   stock market. So we take the cost of volatility in exchange for the potential return of stocks.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:47.600]   Now, so if you ask me, "Joshua, do you think that in the fullness of time, I will be better off and
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:53.360]   have more money in the long run if I just put $625 into the stock market versus $625 in the
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.480]   life insurance policy," I'm going to say stock market, okay? But that's not the situation that
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:04.400]   he's in. He's already putting aside, let's call it $30,000 or $35,000 a year in the stock market.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:09.920]   So we have to look at it and say, "Is $30,000 or $35,000 a year in the stock market,
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:16.000]   is that enough money in the stock market where now we want to consider some alternative
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.920]   assets that have different features?" What do you think is the answer to that question?
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.600]   And that's probably a question for him directly. I'm not really sure.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.320]   Right. But I've got you to talk to. What do you think about that question?
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:36.800]   If it was me, I would probably put less into life insurance and more into the stock market,
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.120]   but maybe not get rid of the policy completely.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.240]   Right. And that's an option. We're going to go over the non-forfeiture options in just a minute.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.880]   But my point is that this is where I think life insurance is very suitable and is very appropriate.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.640]   So if I were a life insurance agent today, and I was selling life insurance,
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:58.800]   and I had to create a basic standard model, what would I do? How old was he when he bought the
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.080]   policy? About 31.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.880]   Okay. So if I approach a 31-year-old guy, a single guy, what I would tell him, I would say, "Listen,

[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.640]   You should buy a whole bunch of term life insurance. If you want to buy some whole life
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:45.600]   insurance, here's how it works. So I would always do a full presentation of here's what 2 million
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.720]   of term life insurance is like, here's what 2 million dollars of whole life insurance would
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.600]   like. When you do that, 95% of the time, people are desperate to buy whole life insurance. When
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:57.440]   they actually understand how the product works, they're like, "Oh, absolutely, I should do it."
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.680]   And I would say, "No, I don't think you should do it at all." I would sell him, you know, 1.9
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.320]   million dollars of term life insurance and 50 or 100 thousand dollars of whole life insurance.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:11.280]   The reason being that I think everybody will be glad to have a little bit of whole life insurance.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:15.680]   Then what I would tell him is, but at 31, and whatever he was making at the time,
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:21.920]   you must first fund your Roth IRA and you must first max out your 401k. And I would tell him
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:27.280]   you must do that because every year that passes that you don't maximize these accounts, you lose
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.440]   because now you can't ever go back and get it back. Plus, that money works really well in the
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:37.680]   stock market where we have really great stock opportunities. And if we don't have that,
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.800]   and this money is asset protected, it's completely exempt from the claims of creditors depending on
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.760]   state laws on the Roth IRA. In addition, I would say this is the most flexible asset for the long
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:53.200]   term. So this is where most of your money should be focused. Now, for someone who's making 100
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:58.000]   thousand dollars or 70 thousand dollars, he doesn't have more money available to him than that.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.320]   So maxing out the Roth IRA and the 401k is what always makes sense. So if I were coaching this
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.960]   life insurance agent, I would say, you dumbo, why would you sell him this big of a policy when he's
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:14.960]   not first maxing out his Roth IRA and his 401k? But when you come back and you're making $150,000
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:20.480]   a year or $250,000 a year, suddenly putting 30 grand in the 401k is not nearly what you need,
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.800]   and you need a lot more. So there's lots of other options of things that we can do. We could just
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   open up a brokerage account, buy mutual funds or stocks, and that works fine. We could trade
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.120]   crypto. We could go buy houses, all kinds of things we could do. But here's where life insurance is a
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:41.200]   super interesting asset, because now we have an asset that grows pretty well if it's with a good
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:47.120]   company. It's safe and it's stable. It grows tax deferred. It can come out tax free in various
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.800]   forms. It's not reported on the FAFSA. It's creditor protected in many states. And so having
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.680]   a small percentage of your money going into it doesn't harm other financial goals. So with this
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.360]   guy, if there's not another financial goal that's being harmed, I would love to see him keep the
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:09.600]   full policy, because he can fully fund the 401k. He can fully fund a Roth IRA. That's all the money
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:13.840]   he needs in the stock market. He could probably do other important things like buy a house,
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:21.600]   things like that, without the policy impeding those important decisions. If he wants to get
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:26.320]   married, he can get married. I don't want a life insurance payment to disrupt his other decisions,
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   but I think it's a really great fit for him now. I wouldn't have sold it to him three years ago,
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.400]   but today, from what you're saying, he can probably have it. And if we fast forward,
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:41.680]   there's a good chance that he will be happier to keep the policy, and his current annoyance with
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.080]   it will probably 10 years from now be general happiness with it, for all of those advantages
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:50.400]   that I said. Now, he may disagree. And if he does disagree, here's what I'm going to be listening
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:57.040]   for. What I'm going to be listening for is some important life decision or financial decision
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.840]   that is being hindered by the life insurance policy. So if he says, "Well, I just can't afford
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.680]   to buy a house," and he proves to me that I can't afford to buy a house because of the life insurance
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.320]   policy, well, I'm probably going to say, "Buy the house. Let's lower down the life insurance policy."
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.520]   Or if he says, "I really want to start a business, and this is really what I'm focused on,
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:18.400]   but I got this stupid $625 a month life insurance payment." All right, well, let's defer the payment
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:24.800]   in some way. Cancel it, defer it. We'll do a couple of things, but let's eliminate the payment so that
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:30.880]   you can do these other decisions. But if he can do those other important things and still be forced
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:36.720]   to save the 625, he'll probably be happier with that course of action 10 or 15 years from now
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.800]   than he will be if he just cancels the policy. Does that logic make sense? Do you think it holds
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   water? I think it does, and that brings to bear. I do know that he was speaking to me about wanting
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.480]   to buy a house in the future, and he does live in a high-cost living state where houses are pretty
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:56.400]   expensive. So I know that was one obstacle he was facing, but I'm willing to hear also how he might...
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:02.560]   Primarily, what I wanted to ask you was to see what was the best decision he could make given
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.320]   that he's already three years into it and for the reasons you stated, what are the options that he
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.280]   has for A, getting out of it, or B, being convinced to stick with it, as you mentioned?
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.000]   So we'll go now to the getting out of it. I think I've said my piece.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.360]   What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to acknowledge that I don't know if this was the right decision
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.720]   or the wrong decision. I know that when I sold life insurance, I oversold it sometimes. I was
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.960]   good at getting people to buy it, and then a year later, they would be like, "Oh, this was too much."
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.600]   And so I learned to stop overselling and start underselling because that was better for
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.600]   longevity, and then I would just have people come back and buy more in the future. So it's
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:42.240]   a common thing. I've made that mistake. He's made that mistake. I think what I've described,
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:48.720]   I believe I could defend this philosophy. I'm doing it in public, but I feel good about
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:54.240]   defending this to any financial planner. I feel good about selling small whole life insurance
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:59.440]   policies to anybody who wants one because I think that most people will be happy with them.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.520]   I feel good about filling up all of the tax-deferred accounts first and then coming
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.680]   back to life insurance. I feel good about acknowledging that this is a useful asset
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:13.760]   class in those constraints, and then you can consider what's right from there. But to me,
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:19.520]   I think this is a reasonable appreciation and a good practical approach. So let's go
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:26.480]   to his options now. So the first thing that he could do is—and by the way, he doesn't have to
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:32.080]   do all or nothing. So the first step he should make is call the life insurance agent. He should
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:37.520]   ask for an in-force illustration showing him what's happening with the policy now, now that
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:41.840]   he's three years into it, what's going to happen this year, next year, the next 10 years, given
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.880]   whatever the dividend rates are of the company or given whatever the provisions are. So the first
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:53.200]   thing that he can do without actually touching the policy is he may be able to adjust his premium
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:59.360]   by looking at any riders or add-ons that he has. So sometimes someone will have some kind of
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.240]   aggressive rider system of additional purchase benefits or things like that, and if we drop that
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.520]   off, they might drop off $100 a month on a premium. And so look at any riders or options that he has,
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.720]   consider the cost of those, and maybe he doesn't want to have them. Maybe he bought the waiver
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.960]   a premium but doesn't need it anymore, and so that might reduce the expense down a little bit.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   The second thing to acknowledge is that he doesn't have to do all or nothing.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.240]   So the life insurance policy can be reduced, and it can be reduced proportionally. So let's say
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.840]   he no longer wants to have a $500,000 policy, but he wants to have a $300,000 policy. He can
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.560]   reduce the face amount of the policy and just adjust it partially. He doesn't just have to
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:44.240]   surrender it. When it comes to his non-forfeiture options, here are the basic options. The first
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.120]   thing he could do is surrender the policy and take the cash value. That's step one, and that's the
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.520]   most straightforward thing. It terminates the policy, and he'll receive the accumulated cash value.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.560]   That's the first thing. The second thing that he could do is he could take the policy reduced paid
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:06.160]   up. So he can say, instead of giving me the, I mean, $4,000 or whatever it is of cash value,
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.360]   instead of giving me the $4,000 of cash value, what if I just took the policy reduced paid up?
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.400]   How much whole life insurance would the $4,000 buy me? And that's an option. It's not going to
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.640]   be an exciting option because he has so little cash value, but when people get to higher amounts,
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.280]   then that's a good option. The third thing that he can do is he can take extended term insurance.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.960]   And so he said basically the way that works is you take the cash surrender value, you tell the
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.480]   insurance company, "Hey, I don't need this money back, but how long of a period of term insurance
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.760]   would this buy from me?" So maybe the $4,000 of cash surrender value would purchase for him,
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.520]   say, 11 years of term life insurance at $500,000 for him. And so now he could be insured for the
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.320]   next 11 years in exchange for the $4,000. The other option is, of course, he can always take
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.960]   a partial loan against the policy. And he can do that even while he's continuing to make the
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.280]   premium payments. So if he needed, at this point, he doesn't have a lot of cash value, but if he
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.480]   needed a small loan, he could take a small loan out, use the money for some other financial goal,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.240]   and then he could put it back in and keep the policy intact. Those are the options. He could
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.800]   do any or all of those options, and he can do them on a proportional basis, or he can do it on a
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:21.520]   total basis, depending on the specific contractual provisions of the contract. But what I would say
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.200]   from listening to what you say, if I'm coaching him, unless he has a clear and compelling use
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:34.960]   for the $4,000, I'm going to say keep the policy, and keep the policy at least a few more years.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.560]   And the reason I say that is, number one, I don't think the policy is unsuitable for him,
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:47.360]   based upon what you've described. I don't hear any pressing financial goal that's not being
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:57.360]   met. And I would guess that within say four to six years, the policy will cross the break-even
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.080]   point. Those kinds of policies, it's often around year 10, year 11, I don't remember,
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.760]   but you could check that with a life insurance agent. And the break-even point, just meaning
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.200]   that he'll get back the full amount in his cash surrender value, he'll get back the full amount
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.920]   of money that he's paid in premium payments. So then, instead of having a net loss, he would
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.880]   at least be neutral, and he would only have a lost opportunity cost. But I don't hear any lost
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.920]   opportunity cost from what's being described. So I would probably fight to keep this one going,
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.080]   because I don't think it's unsuitable. He can decide based upon those factors.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:36.240]   Okay. And if you throw into that, that he wants a slightly earlier retirement,
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.120]   let's just say 55, does that change any of the calculus at all?
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:47.280]   Not really. Again, we need to see what his other projections are. So not really. The policy could,
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.840]   so first thing for that, I would love to see the policy quick pay. And so I would take the policy
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.000]   illustration, I would see when it would quick pay. Definition of quick pay just means the dividends
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.640]   are sufficient to cover the premium payments. By the way, that's another thing he could do.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.760]   I neglected to say that, but he could just take dividends. Usually, with policies like this,
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.320]   dividends are, any dividends that are credited are being used to make paid up, to buy paid up
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.360]   additions to the contract. But he can just change what the dividends are, the annual dividends are
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.720]   credited for. And instead of using the dividends to buy paid up additions, he can just turn the
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.240]   dividends to reducing the premium. And so that'll reduce his premium while still keeping his policy
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:30.480]   intact. So he should call the insurance agent and go over all these with the insurance agent.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.040]   He should not be scared of the insurance agent. What often happens is guys like this, we're like,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.480]   well, this insurance agent sold me a bad policy and I don't believe I should keep it and I don't
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.000]   want to talk to him because I'm scared he's going to push me over again. That's dumb.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.080]   Call the insurance agent and say, I think you sold me a bad policy, I'm thinking about cancelling it,
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.480]   but I want you to go over it, go over my options with me again. This is, it's not a big deal.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.320]   That's, insurance agents know that. So the insurance agent, well, that's disappointing,
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.280]   but hey, let's go over it. And he, the insurance agent will be able to make all these projections
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.600]   for him, go over each of the options, and then he could take that and have actual numbers instead
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:12.880]   of me doing it with just words on a podcast. And so at 55, if the policy is quick paying by then,
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.880]   then it can be really valuable. And I don't, I'm not here to sell insurance, but recognize that
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.760]   when insurance agents talk about insurance policies, they're not lying about the benefits of
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.920]   it. So having the money, for example, I was just, I spent this last weekend, I've been pouring over
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.120]   the FAFSA, the free application for federal student aid thing, really trying to make sure I really
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.280]   understand on a deep level, college financing and things like that. I've got a 10 year old,
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.960]   so I'm starting to make sure I really brush up on this. And one of the things that's really
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:52.400]   interesting is that things like the FAFSA, retirement assets are not counted, home equity
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:58.480]   is not counted for when calculating college need, neither is money that's in a life insurance policy
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.040]   or in an annuity. And so in a normal financial planning, I understand he doesn't have children,
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.080]   but in a normal financial planning, if you ask me as a father of children, would I rather have
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:16.720]   three or $400,000 in a life insurance policy, or would I rather have three or $400,000 in a taxable
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.440]   brokerage account? Well, from the perspective of something like college aid planning and need-based
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:26.160]   aid, which every college is going to be based on as a father of five children, give me the $400,000
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:30.000]   in the life insurance policy. That's much more valuable than having the money in the mutual fund
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.400]   account. And so these are not simple things where, oh, it's just absolutely I'll make more money in
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:39.840]   the stock market. It should have a holistic approach and be considered. So if he wants to
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:46.400]   retire at 55, I wouldn't ordinarily recommend life insurance as a primary funding mechanism
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:52.400]   for early retirement, but it can be a component of the mix. And so I would have to dig into that
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.080]   more. I don't see that this is an unsuitable policy based upon his increased income now. I
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:05.280]   don't see that it's unsuitable. So he can do what he likes, but I would say keep the policy now.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.880]   You can always, all of these options are available to you next year. So unless you have an important
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.600]   alternative use of the 625 a month where you really need to do it this year, then look at
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.920]   what the cost would be, look at where the breakeven points are of the contract, and then go from there.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.680]   I appreciate your answer, Joshua. I'll have him listen to this and then I'll see what he does.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.040]   Up till this point, I just told him, hey, just hang tight at least till I can get some better
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.920]   advice from a guy I know. So thank you. Hopefully that helps him. And I would
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.840]   bet you, I would bet you, I'd put a whole $5 on this, believe me. But when I used to sell
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:43.360]   these policies, I would bang my fist up and down on the table, proverbially speaking. And I would
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:50.960]   say to you, I would say to you, the buyer, I'd say, listen, the only way you lose in buying this
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:58.240]   contract is for you to buy it today and then cancel the policy in two years. That's the only
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:05.840]   way you lose. So either don't do that, like don't buy the contract, or make certain that what you're
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:12.640]   buying, you're in it for at least a decade. Because the whole life insurance contract can
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:18.480]   work out fine and be very valuable in a decade, but all your costs are front-loaded in the first
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.120]   year. So the only way you lose is buying the contract and then getting out two or three years.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.120]   And so he needs to, I would bet his insurance agent said something like that, but he doesn't
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.080]   remember, because nobody ever remembers. And everything that he talked about three years ago
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.600]   is fuzzy. So if he cancels it today, he will have had a very expensive mistake. But I don't think
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.840]   it's a necessary expensive mistake. He should acknowledge, all right, if I had to do this over
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.640]   again, I wouldn't have done it. But now let me make a fresh set of decisions. So hopefully that
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.520]   helps. Cavanaugh in California, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today? Cavanaugh.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.080]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.720]   Welcome.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.680]   I called last week to talk to you about kids traveling, and you had some interesting things
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.400]   to say about that.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.920]   And you said you were going to call me back and talk about my podcast about women working,
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.420]   right?
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.520]   I did.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.640]   Wonderful. The floor is yours. Tell me what your thoughts are.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.600]   Okay. So I guess I should start out by saying, I do think we probably agree on a lot. I'm a stay
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.200]   at home mom. I homeschool my kids. My husband works. I think it works really well for us.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:27.840]   I agree that women should absolutely engage in leadership in the home, like you mentioned in
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.000]   your podcast. And I meant to go back and listen to it again before I called, but I ran out of time.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.200]   So I'm doing my best. I wrote down a couple notes of what you said the first time. So I was like,
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.960]   I think I need to, I'm going to push back on this a little bit.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:41.460]   Sure.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.940]   I agree that strong, capable men will want a strong, capable woman. You talked about that.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:49.300]   You talked about like some of the red pill stuff and how some of the guys were just,
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:53.460]   didn't want a woman who was going to engage in the home. And that that was, that's kind of what
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:57.380]   they deserve being like that is that they wouldn't get a capable woman by doing something like that.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:03.860]   But I will say that you, I appreciate a lot of the things you said, but I wanted to
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.900]   gently suggest that maybe you missed the reason that so many women were upset by his speech.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:14.660]   I think you saw a lot of people, the people that appreciated it were saying things like, well,
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:22.740]   he's so pro-family. But when you say pro-family, I wonder if he's kind of saying pro,
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:27.060]   the type of family he's suggesting really only existed post-industrial revolution.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:32.180]   When you talk about women at home with kids and men working like that, just wasn't a reality
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:37.380]   until basically post-industrial revolution given, and you mentioned that a little bit,
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:42.660]   talking about like the history of farming families and wondering school houses. I mean,
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:48.740]   you got into the history of literacy and kind of that, but when prior to the industrial revolution,
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:58.900]   I think you saw a lot of more of an even split raising children. And I, so in Harrison's speech,
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:03.940]   he spends a lot of time like praising his wife and saying, oh, she's, she does so much for our
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.900]   family. It's so important. And I'm really glad that they have the ability to raise their children.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.860]   She can gather so well and that she does such a wonderful job being at home. But what I think is
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:19.300]   concerning is that he sets up a dichotomy between the women being full-time at home and raising kids
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:26.100]   versus women in the workplace. I've been told plenty of times by people, cause we have five
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.380]   kids and people are always like, oh, it's the hardest job in the world. I could never be a
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.100]   stay-at-home mom. It's the hardest job in the world. And generally the type of people that
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.340]   tell me that are saying it really condescendingly because they have no desire to do something like
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:40.420]   that. And it's sort of a, and it's not the hardest job in the world. It's a job. It's a good job. I
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:45.140]   like it. I'm fond of it. I like raising my kids. I like being involved, but it doesn't mean,
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.980]   and when I say that it's not the hardest job in the world, it doesn't mean it's not important,
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:54.980]   but it's one of a lot of things to do. And I find that when people are telling me, oh,
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.140]   it's the hardest job in the world, it's usually people saying, giving the verbiage to, oh, sure,
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.500]   we respect this. But at the same time, like I would never do it myself. I'm just going to say
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:06.580]   it's the hardest job in the world. It means that you should do it. So, and it's a lot of mostly
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:10.340]   guys saying it to me. It usually means like, I would never do it, but you should do it. So I
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:14.340]   can go do something really important is generally how the conversation, they don't say it flat out,
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.980]   obviously like that, but that's kind of how it ends. So when he talks about being pro-family,
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.620]   I guess I would push back on saying that if he was really pro-family,
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:29.380]   it would involve both parents working together to prioritize family life over career and figuring
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:32.420]   out what that would best look like for their family. I think a lot of times it is going to end
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:37.060]   up with the wife working at home just because it's like biological realities. And there's a lot of
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:43.620]   reasons it might work better that way. But to say that this is his wife's life truly began. I've
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:48.500]   seen that quote everywhere. His wife's life truly began when she became a wife and mother. I think
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:53.780]   that's shortchanging his contribution because he talks about that there's a war on masculinity.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:59.540]   And I think that a true masculine man who wants to be like Christ, which is what he talks about
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:06.020]   in his speech, would also be prioritizing his family over career, not to the lack of a career,
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:10.260]   but both husband and wife should be prioritizing their family. Does that make sense?
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.340]   Yeah, it does. Absolutely.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.820]   Okay. So, and I realized that's kind of like a, it seems like a small
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:20.180]   contradiction, but at the same time, I kind of just kept seeing it over and over.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:22.360]   Right.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.620]   There was one more point I was going to just bring up, because you talked about
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.860]   there's a toxic culture towards men. Oh, let me see here. I'm sitting at home. I'm not
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:34.420]   as scared of interrupting. You can go ahead and answer that for a second, and then I'll keep going.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:38.660]   Yeah, I'll start to respond, and then I'll go ahead and come back in a field
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:46.260]   feeder and interrupting when your child is taken care of. What I want to say, I think
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:59.700]   among fair-minded people, I really didn't want to release that podcast, because I'm very conscious
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:15.300]   of how hard it is to communicate effectively on these topics. I sat on it for a week and a half.
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:21.140]   That's fair. When you say fair-minded, I get the feeling that you, like my husband and myself,
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:28.820]   have a very fair marriage. My husband, and just based on things you said about your wife's
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:33.940]   postpartum periods and stuff like that too, that you're involved in child rearing. You're not just
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:39.860]   throwing it all on her to do by herself as she's raising the kids by herself, and you're off making
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:45.700]   the money, and you're involved in the family. That's how my husband is too. He encourages,
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:51.780]   he's able to take the kids and help take care of everything. You're not just putting all of the
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:15:00.260]   effort on her instead of taking care of it yourself. However, I think especially the more
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:04.100]   you encourage men to go out and work and women to stay at home, and you're not allowing for any more
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:09.140]   variance in between, it doesn't always work out like that. I'm again in the reformed Christian
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:14.660]   circles where you run into a lot of guys who then take that as license to like, "Well, I just
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:20.260]   get to run everything." I'm not saying that's right or that's what's encouraged by that,
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:24.740]   but I think it's a natural side effect of saying, "Okay, it's going to be better if women stay home,
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.020]   and it's going to be better if men go out and work." I think you just have to watch out for
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:34.580]   that as a natural side effect of encouraging that. Right. That's a very fair concern,
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:42.500]   I think, is a proper concern. Go ahead. I think you had another point that you wanted to raise.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:48.500]   Go ahead if you have more. Otherwise, I can respond. Oh, I was just going to bring up Viet.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:54.260]   He talks about the war on masculinity, and then he says to fix it that women need to be back in
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:16:03.060]   the home. I think that he's kind of creating a straw man. Not that there's not a toxic culture
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.820]   towards men, but when you say when that's the only thing you're referring to, and then saying
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.660]   women back in the home will fix it, you're ignoring that there's equally toxic people
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:14.820]   against women. Maybe that's not something he's aware of as aware of as a man. Maybe that's not
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:23.460]   something you're as aware of, but as a woman, I can absolutely say that it exists. I have one more
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:27.220]   thing to push back on when you're talking about women in the workplace. You mentioned that men
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:33.060]   are more likely to engage in performative acts for women as opposed to focusing and working
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:38.260]   on what needs to be done or whatever decisions need to be made. That I was also going to push
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.180]   back on because, one, I think it's a pretty low view of men that if women are out of the workplace,
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.300]   then they're going to perform better. I think that rather than saying, "Well, women, you should be
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.780]   in the workplace so men can work better," men should be held to a higher standard and say,
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:55.700]   "Well, then rather than just appeal to their base or instincts, then let's say we'll then
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:03.060]   work harder so that you are supporting women where they need to be." Second, that's not even
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:07.860]   statistically true. I was curious, so I Googled it. I wasn't actually sure. In all of the Fortune
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:16.900]   500 companies, the ones that have more women in the leadership actually perform better in everything
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:22.580]   from sales metrics to – I forget all the metrics that they use. You can look it up.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:30.260]   Yeah. It's a fair – I'm familiar with some of that stuff. I haven't taken the time to look into
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:34.580]   the data behind those articles and things like that. I'm happy to accept it at face value,
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:40.340]   although in today's world, I don't think we should ever accept statistics at face value,
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:47.460]   especially whenever those statistics align neatly with a convenient line of thinking.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:53.220]   There's so many ways to manipulate data, things like that. I think – I don't remember exactly
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:18:01.940]   that point, but let's start there. Do you think your husband – do you think he likes
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.940]   working with women or do you think he would rather work exclusively with men?
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.740]   He has worked with women. He works in a job where he has lots of contractors and definitely some of
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:21.700]   them are women. He doesn't work at the moment closely with other women. He's pretty neutral on
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:27.700]   it. I ran all this past him and he laughed at me. He's like, "All right, fine. Go call and go on a
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.980]   podcast," and he just doesn't care to get involved in stuff like this. He's like, "I'll have fun.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:35.620]   That sounds good." The reality is in today's world,
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:42.180]   there's not really any environment in which most of us have much of a choice. We're pretty much
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:51.060]   stuck in our current reality. Unless you work alone or do something like that, then we just
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:56.020]   all deal with the world the way it is. None of us – we're not going to go back to 1872, whatever
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.500]   that was like. It's hard to know what 1872 was actually like, but none of us are going to go
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.660]   back there, so we all have to deal with it appropriately. The reason I ask that is just
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:09.940]   that most of my life, I've worked with women. I've had female bosses all over across the board. It's
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:18.180]   kind of just the standard thing. I don't know of anybody today, any man today, who would exclusively
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:23.220]   work with men. If you get into some really physically demanding jobs like, I don't know,
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:28.340]   maybe being one of those guys you see on the internet who's literally working on…
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:29.220]   Underwater welding.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.940]   Yeah, underwater welding or the guys in the oil fields covered in black goop while they're
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:40.180]   spinning chains around drill bits. Maybe they are in exclusively a masculine environment,
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:45.700]   but even all of the traditional male-dominated societies, it's all mixed gender now.
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:51.860]   I'm not here to complain, and I don't like to be kind of the negative guy about anything.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:56.180]   What I've just discovered from personal experience, though, is that it's hard.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:03.700]   It's difficult to interact with women when you're a man. It's difficult to do that knowing that you
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:11.140]   always have to take your basic normal instincts and then filter it for who is listening to you,
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:16.580]   instead of focusing just on the core of the message. If I'm together with a group of men,
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:22.820]   I don't worry too much about how I say things, because things like taking offense, things like
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:27.620]   tone of voice, things like that, it's pretty immaterial generally in most male relationships.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:32.260]   When I'm interacting with women, I'm always much more careful about how I say something to be
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:38.420]   sensitive and to be thoughtful about how I express myself. I don't think that means that you can't
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:43.620]   have a productive team. Obviously not. That doesn't in any way mean that you can't have toxic
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:52.020]   men. Maybe a collaborative style of leadership does outperform. Maybe female-led companies do
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:57.300]   outperform. I've seen lots of that stuff. I'm skeptical of the data because I think a lot of
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:03.860]   the actual experience of it is tilted. If you look at a thing like contracting—and I think I said
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:07.300]   this in the show, and this is not a super important point, but I think it's something that's worth
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:14.180]   mentioning in a conversation about this—is that what I think bothers men is if women get special
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:21.540]   treatment. I've noticed that any time a woman can hold her own on the same level that men are
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:26.980]   judged by, that generally men will happily accept her. I know some female contractors,
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:31.780]   and I don't think that they have anything but total respect by men around. I've worked with
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:37.300]   female business owners, and they have complete respect by men around because they're being
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:44.020]   judged by the same standard. The challenge is that in our current society, in many areas of society,
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:48.980]   we don't judge people by the same standard. We judge men and women differently,
[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:53.780]   but we don't acknowledge that we judge men and women differently. This is one of the things that
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:58.660]   is really turning a lot of men off to relationships with women, and it's really frustrating.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:02.980]   If you look at some of the male conversation around this topic,
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:08.180]   then the men themselves are very frustrated because they're like, "My entire life,
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:13.940]   all of the resources, all of the focus, all of the effort goes to women, and they're the ones
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:18.340]   who get pushed and promoted, and they're the ones who get trumpeted everywhere, and now I'm still
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:25.380]   expected to be superior, and yet I had never had any of that support." I don't care much for
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:32.100]   complainy-pants stuff. Some of my heroes are Booker T. Washington and Dr. Drew and some of
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:38.500]   these guys, and so I don't ever, ever indulge any of the whiny-pants stuff that men today are doing,
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:43.060]   but it is important to look at. This is kind of a minor point.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:49.700]   Back to families, though. I think it's hard to know how to articulate any topic,
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:53.380]   and what annoys me is that I wish we could always shoot straight up the middle,
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:57.380]   and we could say what we think, and we could mean what we say, and we could just say clearly,
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:01.700]   "Here's what I'm saying," but it seems as though society doesn't work that way. It seems as though
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:07.780]   there's always a pendulum swing, and that people get exceedingly on this direction,
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:11.140]   and then all of a sudden there's a correction, and it comes in the other direction, and everyone's
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:15.780]   always going too far instead of stopping the pendulum right in the middle.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:25.940]   I think we probably do that similarly in terms of these topics as well.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:34.580]   There's an element where it's absolutely true that men should be helpers. One of the ones that
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:39.060]   annoys me and annoys a lot of women, and a lot of men too as well, but when you say things like
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:44.420]   a father babysitting his kids, I don't say that, because I'm not babysitting my kids. I'm being a
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:51.780]   father. In terms of roles in the household and things like that, I think most of the stuff about
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:24:00.500]   who cleans the toilets and who cooks is silly. I've never seen a successful marriage relationship
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:05.700]   in which the guy was some kind of alpha male who says, "I never cook. You make me coffee," and
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:12.420]   all of that stuff. That's not how my family works. I do plenty of household work, and I don't feel
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:17.300]   like I'm somehow emasculated when I do that. That's my job, is I'm a father, and so I need to
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:26.340]   help and serve my family. That's my basic function. What I observe, however, is that we don't get to
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:34.500]   look at the extreme cases. We have to look at the normal cases. What I've observed is that,
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:39.220]   to the extent that we know or have any concept of what "traditional gender roles" are,
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:46.180]   there's a really simple compatibility that is often stamped out in today's world.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:56.340]   I've stumbled across this video, I think yesterday, of this beautiful young lady who was
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:02.500]   cooking dinner. It was some TikTok video that was shared. The guy had come home from a 14-hour shift,
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:08.260]   and here's his beautiful young Latino girlfriend who's making him an amazing taco dinner at 11
[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:13.380]   o'clock at night when he gets home from a 14-hour shift. There were thousands of comments, and every
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:18.740]   single comment was, "Wife her up. Wife her up. Wife her up. Don't lose her. Don't lose her."
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:26.660]   What I find astonishing is that young women often don't recognize how relatively simple it is to
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:32.100]   attract a great man who's going to appreciate you. Literally, just make him tacos at 11 o'clock at
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.580]   night. You don't need to earn $100,000 a year. Just make him tacos at 11 o'clock at night,
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:40.100]   and he probably will turn out to be an incredibly devoted husband to you.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:47.460]   That doesn't make a rule about anything. What gets lost in our current environment
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:54.100]   is the appreciation that men and women are different, and there are natural compatibilities
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:26:01.380]   that really work well, and that these can work well for most people. I struggle to know,
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:06.820]   should I communicate about what works well for most people, or should I communicate about what
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:14.980]   works well for everybody? This is a real challenge of communication. I don't believe that all
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:19.460]   marriages have to work the same. I think it's perfect. There are many marriages and families
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:24.500]   that work great with husbands and wives that both have jobs, and husbands that stay at home,
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:30.660]   and wives have big jobs or big businesses. I think those can work. I know of a significant number
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:36.980]   of examples of those relationships where they're working beautifully, and I would never come in
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:41.300]   and say, "Well, you have to change these things." There are lots of things that can work.
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:48.180]   The challenge is, is that the norm? Is that the norm? Today, I would say the data pretty well
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:56.820]   indicates that, for whatever reason, what we're doing right now is not sustainable.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:02.980]   Relationships are not being formed. The relationships that are being formed are not
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:08.100]   being continued. Families are not growing. Children are not being born at the rates that
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:12.580]   are necessary for the continuance of our civilization. So what the answer to that is,
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:18.180]   I'm not certain, and I think that it's an open question. Just at lunch today, I was talking with
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:22.900]   my wife about this question. I read this really fascinating Washington Post op-ed that a listener
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:30.900]   sent me. It was just published two days ago, and it was by Monica Hess. The title of her essay was,
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:35.700]   "Don't pin the birthrate problem on the birth givers. A lot of women don't want 2.1 kids. We
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:40.740]   need an economic model in which that's okay." She wrote this very interesting essay, but the most
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.900]   important thing that she said was where she talked about population decline. Here's one paragraph
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:52.100]   from it, where she said, "Plenty of researchers studying population decline have attempted to
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:57.140]   figure out what is happening to begin with. But unfortunately, it turns out the answer is that
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:03.220]   we really don't know. What we do know is that almost without exception, when women live in
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:09.220]   places that allow them access to birth control, access to education, and access to jobs, they
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:14.900]   overwhelmingly have fewer children. Even if, as in Taiwan, Russia, Italy, and Greece, the government
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:20.100]   literally gives women cash money for reproduction. Even if, as in South Korea, the government has
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.740]   been addressing the issue from every possible angle, including building a high-speed rail system
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:29.300]   designed to shorten commutes and make more time for family life. The only parts of the world where
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.260]   the birthrate seems to be steady, or increasing right now, are in places in which birth control
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:39.860]   is hard to come by, and where women's roles are relegated to domestic labor. It's almost as if,
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.940]   when women are given the chance to control their own reproduction, and when they have the education
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:47.940]   to have the option of working outside of the home, and when their society welcomes their
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.820]   contributions in fields beyond motherhood, and when they're paid for their work, it's almost as
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.460]   if leveling the playing field between women and men has allowed women to truly choose how many
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:03.780]   children they really want to have. That answer, for a lot of women, seems to be fewer. She goes on,
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:10.420]   but I thought that was such an insightful question that she raised, is that we need to be talking
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:18.340]   about these things broadly and consistently, and in good faith, going back and forth to understand.
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:25.460]   Maybe it is the case that women have been oppressed throughout history. Maybe it is the
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:33.220]   case that when women have education and are empowered and have birth control and whatnot,
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:39.220]   that they don't want to have babies. Maybe that is the case. Then why? Is there a sustainable
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:44.740]   alternative? Let me stop because I'm kind of rambling a little bit. I don't disagree with
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:49.700]   your comments. I think most of your comments sound to me just like the challenge of communication.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:58.900]   Who are you communicating to and doing it one way versus two way? I do hope that we can continue
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:04.020]   in our own private circles and, when possible, in public to talk about them. I guess back to
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:10.660]   the point I was trying to drive is, should I talk to everybody or should I talk to the majority?
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:20.740]   Maybe at 60 percent or 80 percent of men and women would work really well in a situation in which
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:26.420]   the husband goes out and has a job and the wife is a stay-at-home wife and mother. Maybe it would
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.340]   be 60 percent where that would work well or 80 percent where that would work well. Maybe it's
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:34.660]   20 to 40 percent where that wouldn't work well. I don't want to cut off that 20 to 40 percent,
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:39.460]   but what I observe talking to a lot of young people today is that they believe that they
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:45.220]   have to make everything up in life themselves. If you go and you talk to a 24-year-old fresh,
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:52.260]   new college graduate and you start asking him about his life, it kind of sounds like he's got
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:56.980]   to figure everything out. He doesn't really believe in religion and he's not so sure about
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:02.740]   religion, so he's got to come up with all of his own original religious ideas about what he thinks
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.580]   is right and what he thinks is wrong in the first place. He doesn't really believe in family,
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:10.020]   so he's got to think about does he believe in marriage, does he want to get married,
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:14.900]   and he doesn't really believe about gender roles. He's got to work it out individually. He doesn't
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:18.900]   believe about children. He's got to take each child and he can't have some preconceived idea
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:24.740]   about how to take care of a child, so he has to look to the child and have child-led parenting.
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:28.580]   He doesn't really know what to do with his work and it's just exhausting. It's an exhausting
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:36.340]   scenario. So could we figure out a really healthy way to say this is our culture, this is the wisdom
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:41.860]   of our cultures over the years that works. This doesn't work for everybody, but this works for
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:47.060]   most people and you should accept these things because it'll work for most people and help young
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:51.300]   people to kind of be on the fast track where they're willing to accept the wisdom of their
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:57.460]   elders and the society that birthed them and grew them rather than them having to make everything up.
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:03.380]   So that's what I wonder about is in our current scenario. Can we communicate that? Is that
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:07.380]   appropriate to communicate or is that wrong? So I'll let you say anything else you want to say.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:11.540]   No, that's fair. I appreciate those thoughts. I thought it was funny when you were talking
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:16.420]   to the woman that wrote the letter and she was responding to whatever you'd said to young men,
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:19.860]   and I hadn't listened to that episode because I guess I'm not a young man, so I didn't care what
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:27.860]   you had to say to young men. But, and then to hear that then you were talking, as you're talking
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:31.060]   about choosing your audience and saying, well, I'm talking to young men, I'm talking to young
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:38.660]   women. Do I have to hedge what I say if I'm talking to young women? I guess I would encourage you not
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.500]   to have such a low view of young men that they can't listen to you talking to women because you
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:47.540]   said something in there about like, oh, well, I have to, if I address my podcast to women,
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:52.580]   men wouldn't listen. If I address my podcast to men, women will listen. And so that's a favoring
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:56.580]   point of women. And you're kind of like having a pretty low view of men thinking that they,
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:04.020]   whatever you have to say to women, isn't worth their time. So maybe just a point of consideration
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:10.260]   when you're talking about what's going to work for the majority of people, I think with the setup
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:17.380]   that you and I both have, works really well when you have a solid marriage. And I think you are
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:22.260]   pretty generous in assuming that the world has, that the vast majority of the world has a solid
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:29.300]   marriage that can stand one person not working. Cause that's a lot of, I mean, that's a lot of
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:36.020]   financial risk for that person to take, right? And I say that again, in the, I'm in a reformed
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:43.780]   Christian church. And for probably the last, I've been married for 15 years for 10 of those,
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:50.820]   the first 10, I probably felt exactly like you do. And I thought, you know, that there was,
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:54.740]   this is the best way to live. And that basically, if it works for me, it should work for the
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:58.340]   majority of people. It's only a small exception that it worked for. And then I would say over
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:05.620]   the past five years, I've encountered way too many situations of men who have been emboldened by the
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:13.220]   message that their job is more important than their wives, because, you know, lots of people
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:18.820]   can stay at home, but they need to go out and provide. And then, and I'm thinking of a situation
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:25.860]   where then as part of providing, he got addicted to uppers to keep him working and then ended up
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.780]   like leaving his entire family. And now she's been staying home for 10 years and has no way of
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:33.220]   supporting herself and her kids and doesn't have supportive family that can take over there. So
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:37.540]   she's stuck. And I, there's another very similar situation. And I've just like watched that happen
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:42.020]   too many times. And I'm starting to question, assuming that everybody is capable of having
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:47.220]   a loving marriage where two sides support. And I'm thinking that the unhealthy marriages are
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:50.820]   actually way more common in the world. This is a consideration when you're talking, when you're
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:54.420]   thinking about who you're talking to and hopefully you're not, that's not who your audience is made
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:58.260]   up of. And again, I, like I said, it's not nothing you've said makes me think that you're secretly
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:01.380]   a raging misogynist that is like that to your wife. And I assume you guys have a wonderful
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:06.100]   unmarried too and it's great and good for you. It's just a consideration about who you're talking
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:12.180]   to. Yeah. And to be, so I don't consider myself, I don't think of myself as an extremist on any of
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:17.140]   these things. So I think the reasons what you are exactly saying, I spent a lot of time thinking
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:22.660]   about should education, for example, should education be different for boys and girls?
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:27.540]   And on one element, I would say absolutely, or should be in terms of the way that boys learn,
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:34.500]   the way that girls learn, I would, I've taken an interest in boys' schools versus girls' schools.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.860]   So anytime I can ask somebody who's gone to an all girls' school or an all boys' school,
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:41.780]   I always ask them about their experience. And it seems to me that it's probably not universal,
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.820]   but many people who are having trouble in school would often be better off if they were put into
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.820]   a boys-only school or a girls-only school. But it doesn't seem like that's a universal rule,
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:55.860]   but separately. But I've asked myself this question, do I think that education should
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:04.980]   be different for boys and girls? And my answer is no, I can't find anything that I think should
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:13.140]   be different about education for boys and girls, except perhaps for emphasis, not for actual
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:17.700]   details. And so the point you're saying is really important, right? I have a daughter,
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:24.260]   I have a wife, I'm responsible to protect these women that are under my care. And one of the
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:31.940]   things that's important is if my daughter gets hooked up with some deadbeat and she gets abandoned
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:36.820]   and she has three children or five children or something like that, I have to make certain that
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:44.900]   she is well-prepared. And so I simultaneously have to prepare her for a world of career excellence
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:52.020]   and employment and making money and a career of domesticity. And I have to prepare her for
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:57.940]   both of those things. And even with skills that are other things, I don't want my boys to be
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:02.500]   incompetent and not be able to cook and not be able to clean and not be able to take care of a
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:08.740]   baby. I look down on men who don't have these basic skills and abilities. I've been the man
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:14.740]   to receive all five of my children. So that tells you something about how much I care. I don't like
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:18.900]   the idea of, "Oh, I'm going to sit out here in the waiting room and let you... This is my family,
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:25.700]   these are my children." So I think we need to prepare for that. And there is certainly significant
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:30.420]   levels of abuse that happen. And in fundamentalist circles where people are hardcore, I think that
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:36.100]   that can many times lead to abuse. And that in many cases, women bear the brunt of that abuse.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:43.380]   The question is this, can we properly protect women while also simultaneously properly protecting men
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:50.180]   and create a culture that is going to continue and expand? And anybody who can fix that
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:56.580]   is fundamentally going to be part of the future. But my fascination with birth rates and these
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:02.740]   issues from a birth perspective or from just a numerical perspective is simply that many of the
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:09.140]   cultures today that are the loudest will disappear because they're not able to reproduce. Whereas
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:14.980]   cultures that have a healthy balance will do that. So I consider the culture that I'm a part
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:22.260]   of pretty healthy. I don't personally know much dysfunction. I know some, but I don't know much
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:27.940]   dysfunction. In my family with my siblings, I don't know much dysfunction. Most people have
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:33.940]   healthy marriages and things tend to work pretty well. And so that's not to say that sin can't
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:41.140]   enter in and there's all kinds of sinful people and I'm never going to count against that. But
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:46.660]   I think that I'm from a pretty healthy culture, but it seems like to have a healthy culture,
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:54.100]   you probably need to have a strong emphasis, but not a mandatory rule. So my fight has always just
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:39:01.860]   been to say, let's appreciate mothers, let's appreciate women for what they do because I
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:07.140]   believe that it's worth it. And my wife's work, what she does, I don't think it's the hardest job
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:12.580]   in the world. I think that's dumb to say that it's not, but I do think it's important, an important
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:19.620]   job. And it's a job that to change the impact of her work would be pretty challenging to just
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:24.180]   replace it with money because not everything can be replaced with money. And I would simultaneously
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:30.020]   stand side by side with you and tell any father who's trying to build a career where he's just
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:34.180]   going to go off and make money. I hate, for example, I hate immigration for this reason
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:39.540]   because all around the world, all around the world, I wind up talking to men who left their
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:45.540]   wife and children in the Philippines and moved to Dubai to go and make money. And it's such a
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:51.860]   destruction of a father's responsibility and he is in no way fulfilling his responsibility towards
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:57.540]   his family just because he sends a paycheck home. So we should be fair-minded with that.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:05.140]   But anyway, we could probably go back and forth all day. But at its core, it seems to me,
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:09.620]   back to just to finish, to respond to your comment about men and women
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:18.180]   and talking to men and women. I care about men. I care about women, but I care about men. And men
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:22.420]   are facing enormous issues right now. And you can see that in a way that we've never seen that
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:28.180]   before. And so we need people to speak to the issues that women face and help them to make
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:35.060]   good decisions. But we really need right now men to speak to men's issues and to do it in a not
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:40.180]   destructive, toxic way. And I hope that I can say a few words that help people in that. But
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:45.700]   I will undoubtedly do it imperfectly. So as I'm sure is the case with you and me, we have to
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:50.340]   listen to one another charitably, push back, clarify, and then try to figure out individual
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.820]   application, because all of us have different circumstances that we have to apply things to.
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:41:02.580]   So thank you for calling. And I welcome feedback at any point in time. And may you know great wisdom
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:07.140]   in pressing through your challenges. And may I know wisdom in the same.
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:11.140]   I appreciate that, Joshua. Thank you.
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:15.220]   Thank you very much. All right, Drew in Missouri, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today,
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:15.720]   Drew?
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.380]   Hey, good afternoon, Joshua. How are you doing?
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.180]   Very well, sir. How are you?
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:27.540]   Doing good. Been listening to your conversation. It's been interesting. So
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:34.260]   we are looking to the Mexico residency. We have an RV. I was on a consulting call with you about
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:40.180]   a month ago. And after listening, after that consulting call, then you had another episode
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:45.300]   with a close friend of yours that started to hear about that. Thank you for doing that commentary
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:51.380]   on that episode. That has led me down to the path of, if I go down to Mexico,
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:58.180]   have you ever looked into like, as a 40 year old man, that has been in the doctor in years,
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:02.900]   I'm on no medications at all, I feel great. But after listening to that episode, if there's like
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:08.500]   a full body scan MRI that I could do, just like maybe once every few years or something.
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:15.460]   And then I've tried to research this online, it's been a little hectic. It's hard to decipher which
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:23.300]   is a legitimate services to look into. We have six figures in our HSA account. So the cost isn't
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:30.020]   really a constraint. I'm just looking to utilize that as we move into our Mexico residency options,
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:34.740]   doing this as part of that, like a medical tourism.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:41.060]   Understood. So I would say, first of all, I'm not a doctor. So I can only just give you general
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:45.220]   suggestions. But I would strongly refer you to those who would actually know what they're talking
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:51.620]   about, from a medical perspective, that's important. So from my layman's like, friend,
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:58.580]   friends talking over a cold drink perspective, I would say don't try to look into anything extreme
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:04.900]   until you do the basic stuff. And so the basic stuff would be to go and visit just a standard
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:13.620]   physician and get a basic checkup. And then I would say, ask the physician about what would be
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:19.780]   the important tests and things that would be good for a man of my age to start thinking about.
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:25.460]   Now, I have been asking this question for a good number of years, specifically about,
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:32.900]   you know, I'd love to have an evidence-based approach for knowing confidently,
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:39.860]   like what you should do at each age. I've looked for books. I've had a couple recommended to me,
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:44.500]   but I haven't found kind of an ideal one. I've looked at a few, but I'm sure they're good.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:49.140]   But I would say you could start with just kind of standard, a few standard articles or
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:54.340]   chat GPT or something like that, and just say, you know, what should a guy of my age be doing?
[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:58.580]   And so, you know, I would think, first of all, you would begin with a standard physician
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:06.740]   with just a regular checkup. You would talk to that physician about the status of what you have
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:12.180]   and what you know about your situation. I would think, certainly, you would consult a cardiologist
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:18.660]   because heart disease and heart attacks are a leading cause of death for people. That was what
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:24.660]   killed that client of mine, was a heart attack. And so, you would start with a cardiologist and
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:29.540]   just get an overview and do whatever the cardiologist recommends. And then, it's my
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:36.100]   understanding that the most important thing to be looking at is not just a one-time snapshot,
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:43.220]   but more importantly, the trends. And so, I've collected some data and suggestions on doing just
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:49.060]   things like regular blood panels. And so, I think one of the things that you should do is have a
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:53.220]   comprehensive blood panel. I don't know how frequently, maybe annually, at least annually,
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:58.500]   and recognize that if you're going from never having consulted with a physician to
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:03.940]   today, starting that process, everything you do is going to be an improvement. But at least an
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:10.980]   annual blood panel, a comprehensive blood panel, would be a good place to begin. There is a guy
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:20.260]   named Emigal, E-M-I-G-A-L, Emigal, who I've read his blog. And if you go to Emigal.com, you can
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:26.580]   find, for example, under his longevity guides section, where he has his comprehensive blood
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:33.060]   testing panel for longevity. And so, you can read through what the tests are that he wants you to
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:39.220]   give. And then, I would say the internet is a great resource for you to learn how to read
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:44.020]   those blood panels. And so, if I were in your shoes, I would take those blood panels, I would
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:49.140]   feed them into ChatGPT, then I would start going over them, and then I would start tracking them.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:53.860]   So, the goal is not necessarily to see what they are specifically today, but to see what the trends
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:58.420]   are. So, start collecting the data, and start being aware of the trends of your own data,
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:05.620]   so that you can properly monitor the data from there. The other thing, then, we get into scans.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:10.180]   I don't know, I'm not a doctor, I don't know the effectiveness of all the scans,
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:18.020]   things like that. I have read Emigal's contributions on it, and he is the guy who
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:27.540]   started the company that I learned about called Ezra. And that's his healthcare AI startup,
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:34.580]   where he's trying to detect cancer early using a full-body MRI, and then artificial intelligence
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:40.100]   to go over it. Is it good? Is it not good? I don't know. After I recorded those comments,
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:46.580]   a listener sent me an article or sent me some resources basically saying, "Hey, you got to be
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:53.060]   super careful of over-testing and over-diagnosis." I'm not competent to tell you. So, go your own
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:59.620]   pathway. But to me, it would seem like doing some kind of scan like that could potentially help you
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:05.780]   to get better early detection of cancer. But you should also do all of the stuff that your doctor
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:10.740]   recommends. So, you should probably do colonoscopies regularly and any other things that
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:17.780]   are recommended for you. And then you should have the data of just the consistent data for yourself.
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:23.540]   At its core, most of it is going to be based upon living a healthy lifestyle. And so, if you're
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:26.900]   living a healthy lifestyle, you're doing a lot, then it's just a matter of detecting something
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:31.460]   early. And if you're detecting something early, it would seem to me that blood panels and regular
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:38.980]   scans are probably the key to most detection. Beyond that, I'm way out of my element in any
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:43.700]   further comments. >> Awesome. I appreciate your
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:50.500]   insight on that. Am I last on your call list today? >> I got two more behind you. So, go.
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:54.100]   >> Okay. I'll hop off here then. I appreciate it, Joshua. Thanks. >> My pleasure. And I would say
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:58.660]   the key thing, as a man, just be paying attention. Men are famously averse to going to the doctor.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:02.820]   Men are famously averse to following what the doctor orders. Women are much better about going
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:07.380]   to the doctor and doing what the doctor says. So, one of the reasons why they live longer than us.
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:13.620]   So, we need to be following through. And when you recognize how important it is, do it. And also,
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:18.980]   to your comments on birth tourism, I think this is a really good reason to do medical tourism.
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:22.980]   If it's hard to do in the United States, there's such a weird medical system in the United States.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:26.740]   But if it's hard to do in the United States, you can certainly do this stuff going abroad.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:33.220]   So, you can get concierge service in Mexico, and you can do all the stuff there. My friend,
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:42.020]   Mikhail Thorup from Expat Money, he does this in Panama City. He's super into this biohacking stuff.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:46.500]   And he goes in, spends a whole day at a fancy clinic, and they take you. You have a personal
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:50.820]   concierge who takes you from here to there to the next thing and does it all for you. And so,
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:54.820]   I think this is where doing medical tourism really does pay off. But you need to have
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:58.980]   a basic plan to begin with. And the nice thing is, many times outside the United States, you can just
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:02.020]   order all the stuff for yourself. You don't need referrals. You don't need any of that stuff. You
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:06.420]   just do it yourself. So, good for you for paying attention to it. Man, Teresa, I think you must
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:11.300]   be my fourth caller from Missouri today. So, I've hit the nerve in Missouri. Welcome, Teresa,
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:17.620]   to the show. >> Hi, Josh. This is Brandon. >> Okay, Brandon. Well, the screen said Teresa.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:22.180]   So, anyway, you're still my fourth caller from Missouri. Go ahead. >> I'm still milking my
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:28.660]   parents' color ID plant. >> Good for you. How can I serve you today, sir? >> Got a quick question
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:35.220]   for you about your book recommendation, Deep Nutrition. The author, Dr. Kate Shanahan,
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:43.300]   makes the argument in the first third part of the book that it is ideal for a woman to wait
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:52.660]   preferably three if not four years in between pregnancies for optimal health for offspring.
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:50:01.220]   This makes sense just from a practical perspective. I should note that I haven't read the rest of the
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:06.260]   book. I'm only a third of the way through, but I intend on reading the rest of it. But, obviously,
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:14.500]   I would say the vast majority of couples in America who get married in their 20s or 30s at
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:19.780]   this point, they're looking to have multiple children. They don't have the luxury of that
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:27.780]   kind of time before the woman reaches a point of infertility. So, how should we think about
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:39.860]   the vitality of offspring versus the quantity? >> Interesting question. There are probably two,
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:45.460]   I'm sure there are many approaches to that, so let me not limit it to two. So, for example,
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:50.340]   most people would have the approach just to say that husbands and wives have sex,
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:56.580]   babies come when they come, why worry about it, take it as it comes. That would be one approach
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:51:01.860]   that some people engage in. That's pretty uncommon, at least among my circles and probably
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:11.380]   your circles as well. One of the features of our modern-day philosophy is that basically we assume
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:20.340]   that childbearing is up to us. I think that that assumption is only true in some circumstances,
[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:26.340]   that in many cases it's not up to us. So, it can't be planned as perfectly as we think it can be.
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:31.460]   Usually, I think this comes more from the perspective of infertility. I'm making a minor
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:36.180]   cultural comment here that I've talked to all kinds of young couples who just said, "Well,
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:41.540]   I have to worry about this. Are we going to use birth control or are we not? How are we going to
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:46.020]   plan our family out?" They have all these ideas and then they decide to start having babies and
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:51.060]   five years later they still have no babies. Their attitude is totally changed when you realize,
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:55.620]   "Wait a second, this is not necessarily up to us." So, that would be one approach.
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:52:00.580]   Another approach, you could take the technologist approach and you could say, "What we should do is
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:09.380]   we should store our sperm and bank our eggs and have all of our babies with implanted embryos
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:15.140]   that have all been genetically tested for optimal outcomes." So, you could take the high
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:22.740]   technologist approach. You could take the approach of, like you said, of having a perfect plan.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:30.260]   Where I first ran into this was with the Domen people and Glenn Domen, who I read a lot of his
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:34.580]   stuff on Teach Your Baby to Read and early child education. He was big on making sure that you
[01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:38.900]   really maximize those years. So, I used to read all the Domen mom blogs and some of them were like,
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:43.380]   "Well, I need to make sure I have three to four years between my babies so that my babies can be
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:49.140]   absolutely perfectly educated in reading and doing advanced calculus by the time they're
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:52.660]   four years old. Then, I can go ahead and take another baby. Otherwise, I'll be shorting
[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:57.460]   my children and their long-term outcomes and benefits." Then, you could take, as you alluded
[01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:01.140]   to, Dr. Shanahan, who says, "For the optimal health of the baby, the mother's body needs
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:06.900]   time to come together," and all of this stuff. So, I'll give you my answer, which is obviously
[01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:09.940]   what you're asking, but I'm just pointing out some of the things that happened. First of all,
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:15.300]   do you have any children today? We have one on our way. Okay. Congratulations.
[01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:24.340]   Here's my philosophy. Take them one at a time. What I mean by that is just the only people that
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:31.380]   matter are you and your wife. Take them one at a time. When I got married, I didn't set out to
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:36.580]   have a goal of having 18 children. I just took them one at a time. My wife didn't have a goal
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:42.900]   of having 18 children. I took them one at a time. So, if you take it one at a time and you recognize
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:48.020]   that the most important duty that you have, your fundamental duty and obligation, is to your wife.
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:54.740]   So, back to the earlier conversation from the lady who called in in response to what I said,
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:59.620]   as a husband, I believe one of the most fundamental duties that you have is to move
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:06.500]   together with your wife and to work together with your wife. If you and she are not in agreement
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:12.260]   about your children or your lack of children or your use of birth control or not use of birth
[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:17.220]   control or the timing of your children or the number of children or things like that,
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:24.100]   you have to work together. And that means that you have to be on the same page. And so you interact
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:28.740]   and you work with her and you understand her position and you share your position and you
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:35.540]   don't move forward until and unless you are in agreement and you talk about it between the two
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:42.980]   of you. And the issues related to children are much bigger than just, you know, waiting three
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:48.340]   years between pregnancies. It's everything as far as what our family can handle, what our family
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:56.820]   can't handle. And different couples are going to have different experiences. You and your wife
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:55:02.420]   may only be able to handle one child, which makes the entire thing a moot point. Your best friends
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:08.900]   across the street, they may be able to handle 11 and be fine. You and your wife may be able to have
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:14.580]   a baby every 18 months and she's just the picture of health. Your friend across the street, she
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:22.340]   might only be able to have a baby every five years and barely recover. Everything is subjected to
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:27.860]   this. And so everything from natural birth to C-sections, if a woman has multiple C-sections,
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:33.860]   it becomes very risky for her to have many children. And there's just so many more elements
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:39.700]   as far as the age of the children, how strong you are as parents versus how overwhelmed you are by
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:44.100]   your children. Are your children getting the attention, the care, the time, and everything
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:50.420]   that you receive? So the only answer I'm going to give is that you talk about it together with
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:56:01.060]   your wife and the two of you come to an agreement. And you should be able to have enough experience
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:06.980]   together in the fullness of time to understand what's necessary. But if I'm a husband and let's
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:12.420]   say that I observe that my wife is struggling physically. My wife had a bunch of dental
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:17.540]   problems after one of the babies and we think it was probably due to not sufficient nutrition and
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:24.020]   to the baby basically sucking vitamins out of her bones. And so we needed to improve some things.
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:31.780]   If I observe that my wife is physically not strong and that she's not physically completely
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:36.820]   rested and recovered from childbirth, I don't want to have any babies. I don't want her to
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:42.660]   be overwhelmed. And if she's not confident about it, then I don't want her to be in that situation.
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:49.620]   So my answer is simply to say that in the intimacy of your relationship together with your spouse,
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:54.820]   the two of you talk about these things and you come to an agreement. And it's nice to be informed
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:57:01.860]   by what people say, but most of my babies are two years apart, so I'm not following Dr. Shanahan's
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:06.020]   advice. But that's not the only thing, right? There's all kinds of things. So the other component
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:12.820]   I would just say is that for me, having babies has always been a matter of faith. And that faith is
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:18.100]   not—when I use the word "faith" in this context, I don't mean like kind of just screwing up and
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:24.020]   believing in something, as some people interpret the word. I mean coming to a place of confidence
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:30.820]   and my trust in God and my trust in the outcome that I'm willing to have a baby. My wife and I
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:35.860]   are not young anymore. And so as we get older, if we have children, there's an increased risk of
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:42.660]   handicapped children, various disabilities, things like that. And I have five beautiful,
[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:48.660]   healthy children. And you think, "Man, you know, what's the risk about having a handicapped child?"
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:53.300]   And I don't really want a handicapped child. And so if I were to have a baby, I would have to come
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:58.260]   to a place of faith and confidence just to say, "I'm willing to do this." My wife has to come to
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:04.020]   that as well. So I would just—I would want to encourage you very strongly, take somebody who
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:09.540]   gives a philosophy. You know, I try to make an argument, an apologetic for, "Hey, let's have a
[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:14.020]   lot of children. Let's have a lot of grandchildren, great-grandchildren." But I'm assuming and
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:20.500]   explicitly saying now that you should take whatever's inspiring to you about that,
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:25.060]   and you should go back to the relationship with your wife and your own confidence and your
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:29.700]   relationship with God, and you should make whatever decisions there that are appropriate to your
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:34.980]   family. Take external input, external encouragement, and then re-filter it within your own
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:40.820]   personal context. Take them one at a time. I don't see any other solution other than just take them
[01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:45.220]   one at a time based upon where we are, what we can handle, what we can't handle, how we're doing,
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:49.220]   and then go from there. And don't worry about kind of any of that long-term philosophy stuff.
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:55.700]   Appreciate it. I think that's what I needed here, Joshua. Also, I loved your podcast episode on
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:59.940]   employment at work. It was fantastic. Good. Thank you. I'm glad that it was helpful,
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:04.740]   and thank you very much. Peter in New York, you're going to round us out today. Welcome. Thank you
[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:11.860]   for being patient. How can I serve you today, sir? Hey, Joshua. How are you? Very well. I have a
[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:17.700]   quick question about consulting, but can I give a 30 seconds on the caller too before who asked
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:22.580]   about screening? Please do. Yes. I saw your name, and I should have brought you on live to that.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:29.380]   Well, I don't know how helpful it would have been, but so I'm a urologist, so I am a doctor.
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:36.660]   We do do some screening mainly for prostate cancer, but just, you know, at a high level,
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:40.660]   when you're talking about what he's talking about is screening for illness that he doesn't have yet
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:47.380]   as opposed to treating a condition that he has. And so when you're talking about what we call
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:53.460]   the primary prevention of disease, preventing it before you get it, it is very complicated,
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:57.860]   and there are a lot of different things that you can try to primarily prevent.
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:04.340]   When it comes down to it, there are guidelines that are out there for, you know, the broad
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:08.820]   physician community and then within sort of specialties as well about what screenings are
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:13.860]   age appropriate for what people at various ages, and most of them relate to screening for cancers
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:18.740]   like breast cancer with mammograms, prostate cancer with PSA testing, lung cancer with chest
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:24.100]   CT scans, colon cancer with colonoscopy, et cetera, et cetera. But things like immunizations
[02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:29.220]   fall in there, smoking cessation, physical activity, good diet, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:35.220]   So, you know, to the executive physical panel of blood tests, full-body CT, full-body MRI,
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:39.700]   I'm not an expert on this. I've had friends ask me about it, and I've looked at it with the data
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:44.660]   that's out there. You know, when it comes to those things, there's pros and cons, and it's difficult
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:50.740]   to say to the population whether that's appropriate or not. But there are things like cholesterol
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:55.300]   screening or sexually transmitted infection screening for certain populations, blood
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:59.780]   pressure screening, diabetes screening, visions, whatever, you name it, that are broadly applicable
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:05.780]   to the population, and most of that can be found online, actually. And a good resource is something
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:11.700]   called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and they promulgate guidelines on everything for
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:17.540]   adults, kids, children, pregnant women, et cetera. And, you know, the documents are dense,
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:22.660]   but when it comes down to it, I think a lot of people bias the detection of disease over the
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:28.980]   harms of screening that exist. And I can really speak only in my field, you know, prostate cancer
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:34.260]   screening, about 10 or 15 years ago, this task force gave it, they give them letter grades,
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:40.100]   A, B, C, they gave PSA screening for prostate cancer a D, not because it has been helpful
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:45.540]   in reducing prostate cancer, that's what it has, but the further workup of abnormalities led to so
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:50.260]   many problems that the benefits were outweighed by the problems of further workup. And, you know,
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:55.860]   that has shifted over time, but one of the big negatives of full-body CT or MRI is the detection
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:02:00.500]   of incidental findings that are meaningless that create either stress or other tests that don't
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:06.020]   lead to an elongation of life or better health outcomes. And so I think patients often think
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.260]   every time you find something you're going to live longer, but we as doctors see the downside
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:16.020]   of detecting diseases that are meaningless or breed concern, or frankly, lead to complications
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:20.980]   in their further workup. So, you know, whether you get a full-body CT or MRI, that's not broadly
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:24.660]   suggested for the population right now, but things like, you know, that guy getting his
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:28.900]   cholesterol check probably makes sense. So. - So I pulled it up, it's the U.S.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:32.020]   - There's my two cents. - Yeah, U.S. Preventive Services
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:36.500]   Task Force, and they have on their website, they have published recommendations,
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.180]   recommendations in progress. - They got it all.
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.500]   - Perfect. So this is a good place to look for info.
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:44.820]   - And these things change, you know, and they'll say, you know, we did this document last 10 years
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:50.020]   ago, and these are the updates to the document as our knowledge base changes. And they'll give
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:54.580]   a recommendation, A, B, C, D, letter grade as to whether people should do that type of screening.
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:03:00.020]   So that's probably in the United States, the single best resource that exists for people
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:02.020]   to find answers to what they should do at what age.
[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:08.660]   - Thank you. One question related to that. So it sounds like what you're saying broadly
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:13.380]   agrees with what I said that, you know, having, tracking your blood pressure, tracking your
[02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:17.460]   cholesterol, things like that, I don't see any harm, any potential harm from that stuff.
[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:23.220]   With regard to things like full-body MRIs or CT scans or whatever it winds up being,
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:33.380]   would the concern about harm mostly result from false diagnosis or mental stress due to an anomaly
[02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:37.300]   that doesn't actually turn into something? Or do you think that there's some reason to
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:42.020]   be concerned about the actual physical procedure itself causing harm?
[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:49.540]   - So I think, so let's take something that would be easier to extrapolate. So let's go with full-body
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:56.580]   CAT scan because it exposes people to ionizing radiation. So theoretically, if you applied that,
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:02.180]   so screening by definition means you're taking people who have no symptoms of disease and you
[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:08.820]   are trying to identify a disease before it would be symptomatic. And if you diagnose it and have
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:14.740]   an intervention, it will then lead to some improved health outcome, which usually we think of as
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:21.060]   living longer. So the classic is if you smoke, and I don't know the amount of time that they do it
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:25.940]   now, but if you were a smoker of some length of time, they recommend, I don't know the age 'cause
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:30.340]   I don't do this, let's just say it's 50, but there's a recommendation you get a screening CT
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:37.540]   scan of your chest at, let's say it's age 50 is the age, if you've smoked 20 pack years. And that
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:43.620]   leads to an increased rate of detection of early stage lung cancers, which has dropped the lung
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:49.220]   cancer fatality rate. So it used to be, there was no effective screening for this chest x-rays
[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:53.140]   weren't sensitive enough. And now if you smoked X amount, your doctor will put you through this,
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:57.300]   you'll find a lesion and it leads to some improvements, but you also find some lesions
[02:04:57.300 --> 02:05:02.180]   that are nothing that then lead to more chest CTs or people are nervous. And we find these all the
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:06.180]   time on other tests, people who have no risk of lung cancer really, you find small lung lesions,
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:10.340]   they freak out, they need a chest CT and they're nervous. So let's go back to full-body CAT scan.
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:14.340]   So let's say you take a population of healthy people and you expose enough people to a full-body
[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:20.500]   CT scan, you will induce some de novo malignancy that somebody would not have gotten absent the
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:25.460]   radiation exposure. Now, I don't know how many people you would have to expose and what malignancies
[02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:29.460]   would be and what would happen to them, but that would be an example of a harm that you would
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:35.140]   induce on a healthy population by the exposure to the test. I think MRI is probably generally
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:39.540]   perceived as safer and there's probably less of an obvious risk. Although if you did them
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:45.140]   on enough people, you'd probably find something. So I think that the risks of screening with that
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:49.860]   and the reason why it's not widely suggested, I mean, number one, it's impractical. You know,
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:54.260]   CTs and MRIs, there are only so many machines and they're used for people with problems for the most
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:59.060]   part right now. So, I mean, you could fix that, but if you tie up every MRI machine in the country
[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:02.740]   with people getting whole body screening, you know, you don't have machines able to deal with
[02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:07.540]   someone who's coming in the ER with a stroke or who's getting a malignancy worked up. So that
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:11.940]   there is some impracticality, but the issues are in two directions. So number one, you can have
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:16.580]   false positives. So you find things that turn out to be nothing. And there's actually a name for
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:23.060]   imaging on imaging, what are known as incidental omas. Omas is a, you know, the suffix for tumor.
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:27.700]   So they actually call like incidental masses in the adrenal gland in the medical literature are
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:33.700]   called adrenal incidental omas and they're present in 1% of adults. And so there are other lesions
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:38.340]   that you find incidentally that are of no health consequence, but breed stress may lead to other
[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:43.540]   imaging tests, may lead to biopsies, may lead to surgery and may not change anyone's health outcome.
[02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:48.340]   And, you know, you do enough of that on enough people, you get complications of those other
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:53.620]   things. And, you know, it doesn't happen to the average person very often, but if you're a doctor,
[02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:57.060]   you might see it. And certainly if you look at the population, you see that. So you can get false
[02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:01.380]   positives. You can also get false negatives. So you could have, let's say you do a full body MRI,
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:05.380]   you find nothing, you could be lulled into a false sense of security that you don't have a
[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:08.580]   problem that when you, let's say you get a cough, it doesn't go away a year later, you don't get
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:14.340]   evaluated. So it goes by directionally. The other thing is there, there are each test that you
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:19.140]   subject people to there's false positives and false negatives. And those tests have a range
[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:23.940]   of characteristics that they work within where they can either detect things when people are sick,
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:27.860]   or they don't detect things when you're healthy. And those are known as the sensitivity
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:32.900]   and specificity of an individual test. And so when you're doing screening, what you need are
[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:38.020]   tests that are what are called highly sensitive, which means they never miss abnormalities,
[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:44.020]   but what you end up getting then is a lot of false positives. So the classic example is,
[02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:49.780]   is the HIV test. If you have a low risk population that you just draw blood on a screen for HIV,
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:54.500]   most positive results are false positives as opposed to people actually having HIV.
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:58.580]   And there are other ways to prove that's not what they have. But this is one of these things in med
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:03.860]   school, like first year of med school, they teach you about test, testing dynamics and screening.
[02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:07.460]   And, you know, you go to the doctor, you think every test, well, this is the result. Well,
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:11.700]   every test has a range, it works within a sensitivity and a specificity. And there's
[02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:16.580]   something called the pre-test probability of a test being abnormal. So if you come in to see me,
[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:21.140]   you know, I have my, my odds making in my head that you have a certain diagnosis. And then when
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:25.620]   I order a test, I, there's a probability that you have the disease I'm testing for. And all those
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:30.420]   things come out to, you know, spit out where you come to diagnosis and treatment. And it gets
[02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:33.940]   complicated statistically, but there's a thing called Bayes' theorem, which I'm sure you're
[02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:39.140]   familiar with, but it comes into play with the patient you're seeing, what's the probability
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:43.380]   they have an illness. And then you go run a test. What's the test sensitivity and specificity and
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:50.900]   how reliable is the test result? So it's sort of a long exposition.
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:55.460]   No, it's really, really fascinating. So I have one more clarifying question you can deal with
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:09:03.220]   shortly. So from what you're saying, the usefulness of comprehensive imaging would be
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:09.300]   debatable. Maybe so, maybe not. We don't know. Right. Possibly harmful, possibly helpful. We
[02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:15.700]   don't know. As I hear you, the usefulness of call it just standard, you know, checking your blood
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:21.700]   pressure, listening to your heart with a stethoscope, these basic things incontrovertibly
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:26.260]   important, no harm coming from them. Obviously this should be done. You should, you know,
[02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:31.540]   check your blood pressure consistently. So then the question regarding blood panels, I don't see
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:38.180]   any harm of having a history of comprehensive blood panels. I can only see help from that,
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:43.060]   not harm. Would you agree? Is that, is that fair or is there harm that I'm just not, I don't know
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:50.820]   about? So I can't speak authoritatively to everything, but I think that there are certain
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:57.140]   tests which are of benefit for screening purposes. Again, you're talking, you don't have a problem.
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:10:01.860]   Obviously, if you have a problem, running tests is designed to sort it out. You know, you come in
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:06.740]   with, in your jaundice, you know, running liver tests obviously is crucial. I can't tell you off
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:12.180]   the top of my head the utility of getting a screening, complete blood count or a basic
[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:18.340]   metabolic panel, which tests your kidney function and electrolytes or, you know, doing liver tests
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:23.540]   in the average person. There is information about that out there. I think the reality is the
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:30.340]   benefits of those are probably pretty marginal to the average person who feels fine. And, you know,
[02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:35.540]   getting blood drawn is not high risk, but you know, you do it enough and you nail some, you know,
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:40.340]   someone's on our nerve and they get a numb hand and people get bruising and, you know, people get
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:46.740]   scared of needles and have a nice weekend and, you know, stuff like that happens. But, you know,
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:53.300]   I would say firmer ground would be screening for diabetes with either blood or urine testing at a
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:57.780]   certain age. I don't know off the top of my head the specifics for that, but there's better evidence
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:07.620]   for that. But, I mean, to be honest, if you draw, let's say you drop 20 blood tests, the chance of
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:14.900]   a lab error or some anomaly that's medically irrelevant by chance alone is pretty high
[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:20.900]   on that panel of tests. So, like I said, I can't speak authoritatively to a lot of that, but
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:25.860]   cholesterol screening is one thing where there is evidence that it's beneficial
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:31.620]   and they do break it down by your age and your history. So, I mean, that's even something like
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:35.940]   in your 20s, getting your cholesterol checked, if you're even a low risk of heart disease,
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:41.620]   there is benefit to that. And they've got, you know, statements on that. But yeah, I think the
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:48.980]   reality is, is that I think a lot of patients overestimate the benefit of a lot of these things
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:54.900]   and their actual benefit is, I mean, even the annual physical, I think can be somewhat debated.
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:12:00.820]   You know, if you're talking about specific things like screening for cervical cancer with pap smear
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:04.900]   and, you know, HPV testing, if you're talking about getting a mammogram, if you're talking
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:10.020]   about a colonoscopy, you're talking about, you know, these other specifics, that's different.
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:16.900]   But just, you know, the benefit of these individual components of the once-over,
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:22.900]   I think a lot of it is frankly debated. - Yeah, that's good because I would be one
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:30.980]   who, as a non-educated layperson, I wouldn't think about the potential harms, which is why
[02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:36.580]   I appreciate the listener who brought the comments up and you yourself. So, that's good. Well, I'll
[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:40.260]   continue to follow this and hopefully 10 years from now, we'll have more evidence and can make
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:45.140]   better recommendations. In the meantime, what we can all do is do what we know to do.
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:48.740]   We just did that. We'd probably get better outcomes. So, go ahead with your question
[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:54.420]   or comment related to the reason for your call. - Sure, yeah. So, I think I know the answer. So,
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:59.700]   I do, in addition to my day job, I do a lot of sort of side consulting stuff through different
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:10.660]   groups. And when I started doing this, a lot of what I did was through groups that have a variety
[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:14.260]   of different consultants in different industries and then they'll get usually either finance firms
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:19.220]   or consulting firms will come to them to get an expert in a specific area and then they will
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:23.700]   engage you in a one-time, one-hour call to talk about stuff and get compensated for it.
[02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:32.260]   As I have gotten older in my career, I am finding that I am getting inundated by all these groups
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:38.420]   with completely irrelevant stuff and my degree of engagement in those things is diminishing.
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:43.860]   However, every now and then stuff still sneaks through and I think the problem is the way they
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:49.140]   screen has gotten loose and they're just, you know, they don't match me up with stuff that's
[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:53.460]   my expertise anymore and I don't think they're capable of tightening it up. So, the question
[02:13:53.460 --> 02:14:01.700]   I have is how harmful would it be to just unsubscribe from all these things and lose
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:07.940]   any ability to get that revenue stream at this point? - How significant is the current revenue
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:15.060]   stream? - I mean, from all of those things combined is maybe a couple grand a year.
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:20.980]   - That doesn't seem like a big harm to what I'm projecting to be your overall finances.
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:27.540]   If you weren't inundated, if you weren't getting those kinds of requests, could you make a few,
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:33.860]   take your time for it up and make just a couple few contacts, let's say, with somebody who would
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:39.860]   be really good for some expert witness work or some really targeted consulting work? Is it
[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:48.340]   harming you to deal with these inappropriate questions in some way? - For the most part,
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:51.540]   no, because I usually just delete most of these things and if I ever get one that's decent,
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:55.620]   I just, I screen them and go through that, you know, I'll look at the questions and see what
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:15:00.020]   they want and, you know, the hit rate's pretty low. I've got other more lucrative consulting
[02:15:00.020 --> 02:15:06.020]   things that I do, so this is a small part of it, but it's, I guess the real question is how
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:10.180]   important is it to seek out every single opportunity to make a couple extra grand?
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:15.300]   I guess that's really the question. - I would see it as probably of limited importance if you know
[02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:21.140]   that it's not going somewhere. So the reason that, just kind of the basic philosophical reason you
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:27.620]   want to clear detritus out of your life is so that you're free to focus on the high priorities
[02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:34.340]   and the guy who goes after the high priorities with a laser focus is going to be ultimately the
[02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:37.940]   most successful. At the beginning of the call, I think you were not on yet, but I received a
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:44.980]   first or second call today, was a question from a young medical school graduate who had, was not
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:50.260]   matched during the residency process and he's talking about, you know, what do I do? And my
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:55.940]   answer to him was you need to be laser focused on making certain that when next year rolls around,
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:02.260]   you get your residency. And so you need to get rid of everything else except this most impactful
[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:05.860]   thing. You don't want to go off hiking the Appalachian trail right now. You need to be
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:11.220]   focusing on fixing the problems with your board exam scores. You need to be focused on fixing the
[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:14.900]   problems with your interview skills, with your essay writing, whatever it was, you got to fix
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:19.540]   that stuff. And so drawing from that for listeners who heard the earlier call, what I would say is
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:24.580]   philosophically, we want to be really focused on our top opportunity or our top couple of
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:30.340]   opportunities. And anything that's not that can be distracting to us and keep us from something
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:37.060]   that's superior. So it may be that the actual time involved with deleting emails consistently
[02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:42.580]   and just answering one a month, okay, the actual time may not be all that significant,
[02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:48.500]   but maybe that's draining like the mental reserves where you're thinking, oh, my backup plan is I
[02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:52.820]   could do this expert consulting work and I've got a really great system. But in reality,
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:57.780]   if you said no to that couple thousand dollars and you challenged yourself to say,
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:03.460]   what would be a much better option? Maybe there's another type of approach and it might be in
[02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:08.420]   medicine where now I could add $100,000 to my income. Maybe this is the year I can write the
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:15.380]   book on evidence-based prevention for urology. Or maybe this is the year that I can do cutting edge
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:21.460]   research in something and really advance forward or something totally outside of medicine.
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:27.300]   So the only framework that I would use to answer it would be getting rid of the little stuff so
[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:35.060]   that you have bandwidth for the big stuff is usually the best pathway of success because it
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:41.220]   keeps you focused on the big opportunities that lead to the big wins. And those things often don't
[02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:46.580]   come when you have a busy cluttered mind. >> Got it. Well, I think I'm going to
[02:17:46.580 --> 02:17:51.060]   unsubscribe. I've got much higher value opportunities that I get hits on all the
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:55.780]   time. Don't clutter the inbox that I deal with. So this will be easy to just get rid of them.
[02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:59.140]   >> So the bigger application for you to take away from this call would be, all right,
[02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:02.900]   well, that's pretty easy to just unsubscribe from the emails. Maybe it's easy. Maybe it's
[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:09.860]   not easy to get off their list. But going back to your main priorities, let's say you have
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:14.900]   category A, which is big money, category B, which is pretty big money, category C,
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:18.420]   which is pretty big money, and category D, which is a lot more than this, which is category G.
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:24.020]   But you might need to get rid of category D as well, where, okay, this is something that makes
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:30.820]   me $24,000 a year. But that might be distracting you from the thing that could make you $240,000
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:36.500]   per year. So I'm not imposing that on you. I'm just saying that the framework is, let me figure
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:41.940]   out what my best opportunities are. And I probably can't effectively handle more than a couple of
[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:48.020]   good opportunities. But by being really focused on the handful of really high-value opportunities,
[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:52.500]   that's where my biggest wins can come from. So I need to be pretty ruthless about clearing my
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:57.860]   schedule of the other stuff so that I have the ability to always focus on my biggest opportunities.
[02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:03.940]   >> Got it. It sounds like I should have tuned in earlier to help that kid who didn't match.
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:10.660]   It happens. It usually works out. That's what I can say. It usually does work out.
[02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:14.740]   >> It sounded like to me that if he could just... It sounded like he was on the edge. So if he could
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.340]   just improve a few things around the edge, then... And it may have been a fluke. He wanted to be an
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:22.660]   emergency medicine physician. He said there was a lot this year. So maybe next year there'll be a
[02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:28.100]   smaller class and he's in. But we got to work at it. So thank you very much for the call. And I
[02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:33.460]   appreciate the extra advice, even around those subjects. Thank you all for listening to today's
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:38.580]   Friday Q&A show. That ends today's show. In closing, I just want to encourage you. I really
[02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:44.180]   love the feedback and I really appreciate it. I don't keep comments open on the website.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:49.380]   So this is actually a really great way. If you agree with something, disagree with something...
[02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:53.620]   Oops. Wrong music. I was going for music and I hit the wrong one.
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:59.380]   If you agree or disagree with something, I would really appreciate it. Just call in,
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:03.220]   talk about it. It makes for a really interesting conversation among the community here. And as
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:06.980]   always, I don't say this every day because I think it's dumb to say this every day. But
[02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:12.980]   here is a basic framework for any kind of advice and any kind of input that you ever hear.
[02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:20.820]   Take what's useful, discard what's not. So just take in any idea, any comment that's useful,
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:27.220]   and then get rid of it. When you disagree with something, as I frequently do with many people,
[02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:32.020]   disagree with something, but use it as a chance to say, "Wait a second. Why do I believe what I
[02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:36.740]   believe and can I make a good defense of that?" And then in so doing, in the fullness of time,
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:42.180]   we can find truth, we can find the reality that gives us the best long-term outcome.
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:46.020]   And so disagreement is fine. Healthy individuals should be able to disagree with things.
[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:51.140]   And what I'm very glad, what I hope to continue to encourage, to cultivate is
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:57.380]   that you and I can be an example to the world where we can talk about important topics,
[02:20:57.380 --> 02:21:00.740]   we're going to discuss them imperfectly, we're going to ramble a little bit sometimes,
[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:04.740]   we're going to get a little bit wordy, we're going to say the wrong thing, use the wrong expression.
[02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:09.140]   But in the fullness of time, it's in the relationships that you and I have together
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:16.500]   and with our other friends where we can approach a clearer understanding. In order for that to work,
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:21.540]   we have to build a safe space, a safe space to disagree, a safe space to have conversation
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:26.740]   and to speak with one another in respectful dialogue. It pains me enormously that our society
[02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:33.780]   has minimized many of the fora that we used to have for this kind of respectful dialogue.
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:37.620]   But we can rebuild it, and we can do it right here at Radical Personal Finance,
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:42.740]   and you can do it right at your dinner table and whatever other fora that you yourself create.
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:45.380]   So thank you for listening. Have a great weekend. I'll be back with you soon.
