[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.640]   Today is Thursday, September 28, 2017, and here in the United States of America, President
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.720]   Trump and the Republican Party released, or started the process of releasing some of the
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.520]   information about their goals for tax reform.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.200]   Yesterday, they released the document called "A Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.640]   Tax Code."
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640]   The idea is, the headline and the slogan is "Tax Reform.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   More Jobs.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.640]   Fairer Taxes.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   Bigger Paychecks."
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.160]   And as I deal with personal finance here on Radical Personal Finance, I feel like I owe
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.840]   it to you to do a bit of analysis on some of these proposals.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.280]   I've done a lot of shows on detailed, careful tax planning, and I feel like I owe it to
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.480]   you to give you some commentary and some analysis.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.400]   And I want to do that.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.120]   But I can't do that today for two reasons.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.160]   One, it is far too early to have any clarity on specific proposals.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.240]   This, of course, doesn't stop the commentariat from quickly talking about how it's either
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.840]   a great plan or a terrible plan, but it's far too early to have any specific proposals.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.400]   At this point in the legislative process, things will go into committee, there needs
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.840]   to be debate, all kinds of things.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.320]   And so it's just not – there's not enough information where I could properly comment
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.820]   on it with any kind of clarity or accuracy.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.680]   For two reasons, just simply the subject and the way that this subject is handled utterly
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.560]   depresses me.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.960]   This morning I worked through and I said, "OK, well, let me go and start reading some
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.820]   of the analysis, some of the news from people that I appreciate and people that are popular
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.160]   in the press."
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.600]   And I find the whole thing utterly depressing.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.840]   Now, I promise I'm not going to depress you in this show.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.400]   I do have a plan.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.280]   But I just sat here and shook my head and I said, "How can I create anything positive
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   for you?
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.920]   I don't want to depress you and I'm so tired of the political nonsense that – I'm
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.320]   sick and tired of it."
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.860]   But then I think we're probably all in the same place.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.880]   It just feels like nobody wants to tell the truth.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.640]   Nobody wants to have a debate about substance.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   Nobody wants to debate issues.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.760]   We all just want to argue.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   I'm tired of it.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.080]   So here's what I thought I would do and what I'm going to do.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.780]   I'm going to ask you some questions and give you an opportunity to think through your
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.320]   personal philosophy.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.840]   I've come up with a list of questions that are philosophical questions that I think will
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.080]   be useful to you to just consider your own personal philosophy.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.480]   Your answers to these questions will largely determine your approach to specific proposals,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.680]   whatever those specific proposals are that come out in the coming days.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.000]   I don't claim that this list is complete but I think these are just some useful philosophical
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.560]   questions that you should ask yourself and you should ask yourself the reasons behind
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.920]   your underlying beliefs.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.440]   So let's start with this one.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:43.000]   Do you believe that a civil government has the right to tax an individual's income?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.160]   Do you believe that a civil government has the right, has the moral right to tax an individual's
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.080]   income?
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.840]   If so, why?
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.320]   And if not, why not?
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.200]   What's the fundamental basis of your personal belief?
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.280]   I'm homing in here on income specifically.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.840]   There are many other kinds of taxes that we could talk about.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.400]   But since we're debating income tax, what's the fundamental truth that would give a government
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.280]   the right to tax somebody's income, your income, or to not give them the right?
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.680]   Now I encourage you when thinking about questions like this to apply various diverse examples
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.880]   to think about it.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.400]   So for example, with income, we're all so used and accustomed to the way that income
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.280]   taxes are handled here in the United States now.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.620]   Our tax returns and our quarterly checks if you're in business or the automatic deduction
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.240]   from your paycheck if you're an employee.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.300]   But take it down to its essence.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.960]   After all, your income is what you use to pay for the basic truths of your life.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.760]   So let's pretend that you are living in an agrarian society and you grow a crop of sweet
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   corn.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.840]   You sell that sweet corn at the local farmer's market to your neighbors.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.960]   Well, you go out and with the work of your brow, you plant those plants and you have
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.320]   a harvest and you gather in the harvest.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.900]   Now let's say that your tax rate is 20%.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.000]   So then you've gathered in a thousand bushels of corn and now along comes the government
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.880]   agent and says, "You owe us 200 bushels of corn out of your barn and we're going to take
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.260]   the 200 bushels of corn."
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.320]   What gives that government agent the right to make that demand upon your corn?
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.000]   Or let's say that you've taken your corn and sold it to the neighbors and you've collected
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.760]   a hundred pieces of silver, silver coins from your commerce.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.040]   And then the government agent comes down, knocks on your door and says, "You have earned
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.760]   a hundred pieces of silver for your corn.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.280]   Give me 20 pieces."
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.840]   What gives the civil government the moral right to tax you in that way?
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.120]   Do you believe they have that right?
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.360]   If so, why?
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.960]   And if not, why not?
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.420]   Now here's a corollary question of that.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.480]   Do you believe that the US civil government has the constitutional right to tax an individual's
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480]   income?
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.320]   If so, why?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.200]   And if not, why not?
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.520]   There's an interesting investigation there for you which you might want to look into.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.960]   Grab your pocket constitution.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.040]   More likely look it up on the internet and start reading and find out what the constitutional
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:38.160]   right is that the US government stands on in order to collect taxes and research some
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.880]   of the history of that question.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.880]   Next question.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.840]   If you believe that a civil government does have the right, the moral right to tax an
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.400]   individual's income, how much of a person's income can they claim?
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.440]   What's the right number of how much a person's income the government can claim and how would
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440]   you know?
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.200]   How would you know what that right number is?
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.320]   For example, if they had a thousand bushels of corn that you gathered in from your crop
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.800]   in front of your house or if you had the silver pieces that you – silver coins that you
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.880]   earned from a simpler era, the silver coins that you earned from building tables and chairs
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.160]   and selling them to your neighbors, how many of those bushels of corn does the civil government
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.640]   have the right to?
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.080]   How many is the right number?
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.800]   Or how many of those pieces of silver coin does the government have the right to?
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.180]   What is the right number and how would you know if that were the right number?
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.000]   How would you know if 20 pieces out of your hundred pieces of silver is the right number
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.680]   or 10 or 15 or 50 or 95 or 100?
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.760]   How would you know?
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   Next question.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:56.240]   Do you believe that everyone should be required to pay income taxes?
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   If so, why?
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.760]   And if not, why not?
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.840]   Again, do you believe that everyone should be required to pay income taxes?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   If so, why?
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.920]   And if not, why not?
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.160]   Now I'll come out of philosophical question mode for a moment just to add a little bit
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.280]   of personal touch to this.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.000]   If you believe that everyone should be required to pay income taxes, do you believe that that
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.360]   requirement should be expressed in the reality that some money comes out of everyone's pockets?
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.880]   This is one of the biggest challenges that we face right now in the US American context.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.860]   When we come to the question of tax policy and appropriate tax policy, about half the
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.800]   country doesn't pay any income taxes effectively.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.720]   And there's a very different way of approaching taxes.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.680]   Let me describe to you two different scenarios.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:57.400]   Many high-income earners, many business owners, every quarter write a substantial check out
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.800]   of their checking account to the US Treasury Department.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.880]   There are many business owners who, when they prepare their returns at the end of the tax
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.680]   year, write a substantial check to make up for what they didn't pay in their substantial
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.880]   quarterly checks to the US Treasury Department.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.520]   On the flip side, there is a substantial percentage of the population that looks forward to the
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.600]   filing of their tax returns because it means that they get money into their checking account
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.400]   to spend.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.680]   This is a consistent theme for many people.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.200]   They look forward to filing their income taxes because they get a nice check from the Treasury
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.360]   Department.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.720]   If you ask people this question, it's one of my favorite questions, "How much did you
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.920]   pay last year in income taxes?"
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.840]   You'll get very different answers to that question depending on the part of society
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.440]   that you're working in.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.640]   Some people say, "I wrote a check for $30,000."
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.400]   Some people say, "Oh, I got a check back for $5,000."
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.200]   So do you believe that everyone should be required to pay, actually pay, income taxes?
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   If so, why?
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.440]   If not, why not?
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.880]   Next question, do you believe that some people should be treated differently than other people
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:27.240]   and so be ordered to pay a different rate of income tax than others?
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   If so, why?
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.480]   If not, why not?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   Do you believe that some people should be eligible for special treatment and be treated
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:42.800]   differently than other people and so be required to pay a different rate of income tax than
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.880]   others?
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.080]   Here's the corollary question for this.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.560]   If you believe that some people should be treated differently and be ordered to pay
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:57.000]   a different rate of income tax than others, how would we determine who should be treated
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.600]   differently and how much of a difference there should be?
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.400]   Who should be taxed at a higher rate and how much of a difference in rate should there
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.080]   be?
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.080]   How would you know?
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   How would you prove that?
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.360]   Next question, do you believe that government tax policy should be used to incentivize certain
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:30.520]   behaviors or to disincentivize other behaviors?
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.160]   Do you believe that government tax policy should be used to incentivize certain behaviors
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.800]   or to disincentivize other behaviors?
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:52.440]   If so, how would we know what behaviors should be incentivized or which ones shouldn't?
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.600]   How would we know which ones we should encourage?
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:01.320]   Let me give you an example, the US tax code has certain provisions in it that relate to
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.440]   marriage and children.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.200]   Depending on how we look at this, we could view these as a penalty, for example, the
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.680]   frequently referred to marriage penalty or we could refer to this as an incentive.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.760]   For example, if you have children, you're eligible for a child tax credit.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.520]   So the idea is this may be an incentive for people to have children.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.920]   Well, how do we determine if that's what the government should be encouraging or shouldn't
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   be encouraging?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.800]   I've spent quite a bit of time in my life reading various feminist authors and various
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.320]   LGBT activists.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.560]   One oft-repeated theme is that among feminist authors and some LGBT activists that I've
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.880]   read is that marriage is an institution of oppression.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:13:01.040]   Thus, if we encourage marriage, we're encouraging and expanding the immoral, patriarchal society
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.160]   and structure.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.400]   So we should not be encouraging marriage.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.560]   Or another expression of this would be children.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.080]   Some people believe that children are a positive force for good.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.080]   Some people believe that children lead to oppression.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.720]   For example, one of the fundamental legal reasonings behind why the United States of
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:28.920]   America has laws legalizing the abortion of children is that without a right to abortion,
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.160]   a woman is inferior to a man because she has to carry a baby.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.040]   So therefore, if a man doesn't have to carry a baby, then a woman shouldn't have to carry
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   a baby either.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.600]   So children can lead to oppression.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.920]   So should government tax policy be used to incentivize marriage children or to disincentivize
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   marriage children?
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.460]   How would we know which behavior should be incentivized and which one shouldn't?
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:58.800]   One interesting change as of late is that there is a dramatic – there's a dramatic
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.040]   change happening in some countries regarding tax policy in children.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.800]   I shared an article on my Twitter feed last week about – I can't remember which Scandinavian
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:12.680]   country it was but they – this particular country is dying off simply because the birth
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.720]   rate for that particular country is well below the replacement rate.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.320]   And so the government has done practically everything they can with tax policy to pay
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:28.120]   parents to have children, to have substantial parental benefits and to pay for all the expenses
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.960]   of childbirth, et cetera.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:36.640]   And yet still, the population is not seemingly reacting to this governmental tax policy
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.160]   and the population of this country, that particular country is headed for continual decline.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:50.480]   This is a major problem because the vast majority of our governments are built upon the principle
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.360]   of our having more and more children.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.240]   Most of the governmental programs depend on higher future tax revenues that are needed
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.120]   in order to pay off the promises to past generations.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.640]   It's a classic Ponzi scheme.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.280]   Without new children, new taxpayers coming in, then this whole scheme falls apart.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.000]   It's based upon children.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.200]   So should government tax policy be used to incentivize certain behaviors and disincentivize
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   others?
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.960]   And if it should, how would we know which behavior should be incentivized and which
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.360]   ones shouldn't?
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.040]   Many examples we could go to.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.320]   A common one would be deductions for real estate interest, mortgage interest in the
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.040]   United States of America.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.680]   Should a government be encouraging home ownership?
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.000]   If so, why?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.720]   And if not, why not?
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.200]   Next question, do you believe that tax policy should be used to give some people special
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:54.320]   benefits because of certain behaviors or because of a certain status?
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:01.200]   Do you believe that tax policy should be used to give some people special benefits because
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.360]   of certain behaviors or certain status?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.880]   For example, do you believe that the local city government in your town or the state
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.040]   government should give a company special tax concessions in order for them to choose to
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   move their business into your town?
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.000]   Say we're not going to charge you taxes or we're going to charge you a lower rate of
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.920]   taxation because you're bringing your business to our town.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:37.480]   Whether it's an NFL stadium or a local biotech engineering facility or a local entertainment
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:47.360]   complex, is it right that certain businesses and certain business owners are given special
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.760]   concessions for them to take certain actions?
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.400]   Or what about special tax benefits for people in a certain condition?
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:02.580]   For example, there are certain tax benefits, increased deductions, etc. for blind people
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.920]   or for the elderly under US tax law.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:18.280]   Should tax policy be used to give some people who meet certain descriptions special benefits?
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.040]   If so, which people and how would you know?
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.880]   If not, why not?
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.560]   Here's my last question, many more that you could ask.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:35.760]   Do you believe that government and tax revenues for said government, do you believe it's a
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.440]   productive user of the tax money?
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:46.720]   Is it a good thing to be doing with money, to give money to a government?
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.660]   Or do you see government as an unproductive user of tax money?
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.880]   If government is a productive user of tax money, then shouldn't we be trying to get
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.800]   as much money into the government control as possible?
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.120]   If it's very productive?
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   Or is government unproductive?
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.960]   And if so, should we be trying to get as little money into the hands of the government as
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   possible?
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:16.080]   I hope these are thought-provoking questions.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.320]   I just wrote them down, many more questions perhaps that you could ask.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.120]   But I hope you'll consider the answers for these questions.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:30.300]   And I hope you'll consider the support that you have for those answers.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:35.360]   The answers to your questions will largely determine where you come out on a particular
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.140]   opinion.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.640]   Now let me just close today's show with a few thoughts and a few comments, a little
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:51.680]   bit of commentary on the forthcoming political debate in our country for the coming months.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.320]   I really don't think it matters much.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.280]   I really don't.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.400]   If or when I can get more clarity on what's actually proposed, what actually passes, et
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.200]   cetera, we can talk about that.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.360]   But at the end of the day, Gary North convinced me that taxes don't really change all that
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   much.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.440]   Taxes just basically seem stuck at about 20 percent of GDP in the United States of America.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.880]   Yeah, there are little changes here and there and whatnot, but it's all noise.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:23.360]   And more and more, it seems to me that it's just meaningless noise.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.440]   Republicans and the Democrats basically do the same thing.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.760]   They basically want the same thing and all of the so-called differences between them
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.600]   are silly.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.700]   For example, the Republicans – evidently from the information that we have right now
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:46.340]   about the forthcoming Republican framework for tax reform is that instead of having seven
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.560]   different tax brackets, things would be simplified into three tax brackets of 12 percent, 25
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.000]   percent and 35 percent.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.540]   This is not a fundamentally different philosophy from the current system that we live under.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:09.260]   For example, nobody is recommending or advocating for any kind of non-progressive tax rate,
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.040]   for a flat tax rate of any kind.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.440]   Everyone believes evidently – both Republicans and Democrats believe that people who earn
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.360]   a higher income should pay a higher rate of taxes.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.560]   So both Republicans and Democrats when asked the question, "Do you believe that some
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.400]   people should be treated differently than others and so be ordered to pay a different
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.040]   rate of income tax than others?"
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.720]   Both Republicans and Democrats would answer, "Yes."
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.000]   Now why they would answer yes, I don't know why.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.520]   Maybe they believe differently.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.120]   I would say it probably just comes down to political expediency.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.200]   At least for the Republicans, it's probably political expediency.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.800]   They know they can't get a flat tax through politically speaking or they don't think
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.920]   they can.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.120]   And so they're having basically a tiny debate about whether there should be seven different
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   rates or three rates.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.120]   It's meaningless.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.360]   So don't buy into the hype that any of this stuff is going to really matter.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.560]   There's no major difference between – at least so far.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.640]   I need to be careful and not overstate it.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:13.000]   But there's nothing dramatically different about what I have read so far versus the way
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   things are.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.600]   This is all political posturing and the goal is to get – to use tax policy to gain more
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   votes.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.400]   So Bastiat called it the politics of plunder.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.680]   The politics of plunder are alive and well in the United States of America.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:34.640]   The question is who's going to be plundered and how can we build that for political gain?
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.000]   Another example of sameness between – in this political debate, I don't hear anybody
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.960]   talking about the need for a balanced budget.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.720]   Both Republicans and Democrats seem to believe that it's perfectly fine and perfectly right
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.780]   to dole out lots of benefits without actually paying for them and to use debt to finance
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.780]   the difference.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.080]   Now there may be a slight difference in talking about it.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.540]   But in terms of doing it, nobody seems to want to cut spending.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.560]   Nobody seems to actually want to rein in government.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.520]   So everyone has got the best possible solution.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.440]   We can play around with taxes, which the debate over taxes will please our various constituencies
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:15.520]   and please our certain people to buy more votes from here or buy more votes from there.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.000]   It will make us more popular.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   But in the meantime, we can just hand out as many government benefits as possible to
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.760]   other parts of our constituencies and then we will buy some more votes from there and
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.440]   who knows?
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.480]   Maybe someday 100 years in the future, the economy will have grown enough that the debt
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.560]   can be handled.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.960]   Sale seems rather silly to me.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.920]   I believe that this practice that we've all and practically every large, least large
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:45.000]   Western government in the world has latched onto.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.560]   This practice is fundamentally immoral.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   You can't continue to say we're going to run up the credit card bills and pass it
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.920]   along to future generations.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.120]   It's terrible.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.800]   It bugs me to no end when people want to go out and talk about cutting taxes and not cutting
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   spending.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.720]   Frankly, if I had my druthers, I would be happy for people to have a debate about actual
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.580]   tax policy and actual spending policy.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.760]   But let's actually make the checks real.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.600]   Let's actually make the budget balance and say you've got to spend the money.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.640]   So if you're going to pass a new government program, you've got to actually pay for
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   it.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.520]   And you find out if your tax constituents actually want to write the checks for it.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.680]   And if they do, if you've decided that it's all about the votes and the people want
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.020]   to vote for it and they want to vote themselves new government programs, that's fine.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.760]   But make sure you actually pay for them, not just sell them and give away money for free
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.960]   while meanwhile no one ever pays the bill.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:46.200]   Anyway, finally, remember that taxes, most taxes are largely optional.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.560]   You can safely ignore most of this debate.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.460]   It's not going to matter much to you.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.880]   When things are decided, then find the rules, read the rules and then change your life however
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.960]   you need to change it in order to minimize your tax burden.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.100]   Now, you can't get out of all the taxes.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.640]   Some taxes you can get out of, but you can change your behavior and change from a lot
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.280]   of them.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.920]   The people who really get screwed with taxes are those who don't read the rules.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.240]   So you read the rules and play the game.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:23.160]   And then finally, be encouraged with the increase in global competition.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.120]   One of my favorite things actually about the framework that was released and it's probably
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.280]   a political no-go because everyone's going to play their games.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:38.800]   But one of my favorite things personally is the removal of the deduction for state and
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.560]   local government taxes.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:47.440]   That of course penalizes high-tax states, for example, California, New York, Massachusetts,
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.260]   etc., where residents of those states get major deductions for all their state taxes
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.260]   that they pay.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.760]   But I love that.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.920]   If that word actually passed, that would be – that would be great because then it forces
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.960]   reality more and more onto the states and it brings in more and more competition.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.920]   For the last few years, I see that there's a substantial migration happening across the
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   country.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.880]   People are moving out of high-tax jurisdictions and moving into lower-tax jurisdictions.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.360]   I've promoted here on the show the website Savetaxesbymoving.com.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.960]   If you go into Savetaxesbymoving and you type in your city and your state where you live
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.680]   and what your filing status is and how old you are and what your annual earnings are
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.280]   and where you'd like to move to, it will calculate for you the change in your taxes.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.160]   It's so easy to do.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.040]   It gives people the value of being able to show it.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.400]   For example, I just popped in.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:47.040]   If I'm 30 years old and I have three dependents, married, filing jointly, three dependents,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:54.000]   and I'm earning $150,000 per year and I move from Boston, Massachusetts to Dallas,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.760]   I would have an annual savings of $6,720 per year.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:07.360]   Well, $6,720 per year amortized – or compounded out over the course of an investing lifetime
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.720]   at a reasonable rate of interest could very easily be in excess of a million dollars extra
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   toward – at 60, 65, 70 years old.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.920]   So sometimes if the cost of taxes, unless there's an offsetting income benefit, the
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:31.440]   cost of taxes of living in Boston, Massachusetts versus somewhere else is substantial.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.320]   And that's happening nationally with the competition among the states and that's
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   happening internationally.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.760]   I have to keep a close eye on myself on other international jurisdictions.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.520]   If I get to the point where my income comes to the point where it's worth it, I very
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:55.400]   seriously would consider changing where I lived just to avoid the taxation.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.720]   I think that's growing more and more.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.160]   Now it's largely on the periphery.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.320]   Not a lot of people that really are doing this stuff but you can.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.360]   So this global competition is forcing more and more – is forcing reality onto some
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.400]   of the politicians and that's a positive trend.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.200]   So I guess that's what I wanted to share with you.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.280]   I hope that these questions are thought-provoking for you.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:24.080]   I hope they cause you to assess your personal philosophy, your ideology and think through
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.600]   carefully the why questions.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.800]   Use it as a chance to consider your own beliefs.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.200]   Even in some of these questions when I was writing them out, I thought, "You know,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.680]   I'm not sure my answer to that question.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.760]   I know what I think I believe but I can't really defend the why very well.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   I need to do some homework."
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.560]   I hope that they're thought-provoking for you and you take them and do the homework
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.000]   as well.
