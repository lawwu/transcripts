[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.960]   - We open the week with an email from Carla,
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.520]   who writes in with a very short question,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.200]   and to the point, "Pastor John, how does a person know
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.780]   "when he or she is ready to become a Christian?"
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.120]   What would you say to Carla?
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.000]   - It's a good question, because Jesus told a story one time
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   that really emphasized the importance of counting the cost
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000]   before you become one of his followers.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.340]   Here's what he said, "Whoever does not bear his own cross
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.060]   "and come after me cannot be my disciple."
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.460]   In other words, it's not easy.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320]   "For which of you, desiring to build a tower,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.740]   "does not first sit down and count the cost,
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.160]   "whether he has enough to complete it?"
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.560]   Otherwise, "When he has laid a foundation
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.680]   "and is not able to finish,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.080]   "all who see it will begin to mock him, saying,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   "'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'"
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.040]   So that's Jesus' story, and I think it means,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   in other words, being a Christian is not a bed of roses.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.980]   Believing and living the truth cost Jesus his life,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.720]   and the same may be true of anyone who follows him.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.880]   I just read this morning about Christian missionaries
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.780]   being crucified and beheaded in Syria.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.720]   That's what he meant when he said,
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.440]   "Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.040]   "cannot be my disciple."
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.800]   So I am glad that Carla is taking this
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.220]   as seriously as she is.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.220]   And I think the question,
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.600]   when is a person ready to become a Christian,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.640]   will become plain, the answer will become plain,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.440]   if we define what becoming a Christian means,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.700]   or what a Christian is.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.620]   So let me try, and I'm gonna base all,
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.160]   I'm not gonna quote a lot of passages of Scripture,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.120]   but virtually every sentence that I speak now,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.080]   I have thought through from particular parts of the Bible.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.360]   So this is not just, I hope, and I believe,
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.320]   John Piper's opinion, but really what the Bible teaches
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.580]   about what it means to be a Christian.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.580]   Jesus Christ, the eternal, divine Son of God,
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.920]   who was never created, but who always existed,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.420]   along with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.420]   in a mysterious unity, as one God,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.480]   this Jesus Christ came into the world about 2,000 years ago,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.200]   conceived in the womb of a virgin
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.860]   by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.300]   not with God like some celestial man
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300]   shacking up with a virgin,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.540]   like some religions say we believe.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.640]   That's not what we believe.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.720]   The power of the Holy Spirit will overshadow you.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.180]   And a God-man was conceived in the womb
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.460]   in a most spiritual and holy and pure way,
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.460]   and he came, grew up in order
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.220]   to solve the biggest problem in the universe.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.240]   And the biggest problem in the universe
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.800]   is that all of us human beings,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.200]   and every one of us knows this in our heart,
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.060]   from the beginning have failed to love God,
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.340]   failed to trust God and obey God
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.300]   and live in a way that treats God
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.240]   as the supreme value in our hearts and in the universe.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.660]   We have failed.
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.400]   And so we've dishonored God
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.840]   and belittled his infinitely beautiful glory
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.360]   as though it weren't worth anything.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.160]   And as a result of this, and it's treason,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.680]   as a result of this treason against our creator,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.260]   God's justice and holiness demands
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.560]   that we be appropriately punished.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.440]   And given the fact that God is an infinitely worthy God,
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.800]   therefore our punishment in order to be just
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.360]   must be infinite, and that's why hell exists.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.360]   But God is not only holy and just, the Bible reveals.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.840]   He is also gracious and patient and loving,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.880]   and therefore he planned a way
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.380]   to solve this biggest problem in the universe,
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.000]   namely the massive chasm that exists
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.560]   between us sinners and God in his holiness
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.600]   and justice and purity.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.120]   And the solution that he designed
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.740]   was that God sent Jesus Christ into the world
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.520]   to become a substitute for everyone
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.560]   who would believe in him.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.060]   In other words, when Jesus Christ died on the cross
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.060]   as the God-man, he bore, this is an exact quote,
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   he bore the sins of all of those who would trust in him.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.260]   He bore our guilt, he bore our punishment,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.480]   he bore the wrath that we should receive
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.000]   and don't have to receive if we are hiding by faith
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.700]   in Jesus as our asbestos protection,
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.780]   because he bore it for us.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.160]   And then he rose again from the dead
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.760]   to vindicate the success of his saving work on the cross.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.800]   And so everyone who trusts Jesus
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.680]   is viewed by God as united to Jesus
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.000]   so that the death of Jesus counts as our punishment
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.800]   and his resurrection guarantees our eternal life.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.080]   And so the chasm between us and God is overcome
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.480]   and we are enabled to live with overflowing joy
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.000]   in the presence of infinite beauty,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.600]   namely God, forever and ever.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.880]   And the reason this is possible
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   is not only that God took our guilt away through Jesus,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.960]   but also because when we're united to Christ by faith,
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.640]   we receive that other person of the Godhead,
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.120]   namely the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.560]   So all three, the Father, the Son, the Spirit
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.640]   are at work in our salvation.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.120]   We receive the Holy Spirit who begins to work in us
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.840]   new desires, new passions, new loves,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.360]   so that we're actually able to enjoy the God
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.960]   that we once were so afraid of or hated or didn't believe in.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.240]   Now, what all of that means
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.960]   is that becoming a Christian involves something
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.220]   more than a mere decision to believe certain doctrines
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.060]   or perform certain behaviors.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.000]   This is so crucial.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.120]   Becoming a Christian also involves
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.800]   a miracle of a changed heart.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   Before we become Christians,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.600]   our heart does not embrace Christ.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.620]   It doesn't see him as Savior and Master
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.120]   and supreme treasure of our lives.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.140]   Before we're Christians, we feel self-reliant.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.200]   We feel like we're the masters of our own fate.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.560]   We treasure many things more than we treasure Jesus.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.960]   That's the condition of my heart before I was a Christian.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   And the change from self-reliance to Christ-reliance
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.840]   and from being master of my own fate
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.040]   to being utterly dependent on Jesus
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.640]   and from treasuring the world and a zillion things in it
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.640]   more than I treasure Christ or God the Father,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.040]   that change is a miracle.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.380]   It is a miracle.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.700]   It is so beyond me.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.040]   I can't snap a finger and change all those passions
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.420]   and desires and loves in my life.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.480]   It's called in the Bible, the new birth.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.440]   Jesus said, "Unless we're born again,
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.680]   we can't see the kingdom of God."
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.800]   And that new birth is what makes us a Christian.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   It's a change of heart so that we love to trust Christ
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.080]   as our substitute and we love to trust Christ
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.600]   as our master and Lord and guide in everything.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.160]   We love to receive Him as our supreme treasure in our lives.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.960]   And nobody can make that happen to themselves.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.920]   But we can listen to the Word of God
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.480]   and we can pray that God would come and open our eyes
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.680]   so that we can see Christ for who he really is
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.760]   and want to be drawn to Him.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.440]   And the Bible says that faith comes by hearing.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.620]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.160]   so we can listen to the Word of God.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.800]   So the real answer to the question,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   how can I know if I am ready to become a Christian,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.000]   is this, as you listen to the Word of God,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.560]   as you read your Bible, or as you listen to a sermon
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.760]   about the Christian gospel,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.680]   do you find yourself being changed?
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.120]   Do you find yourself being changed
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   so that Christ now is appearing as true and beautiful
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.720]   and your sin is starting to appear ugly
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   and God-dishonoring and shameful
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.600]   and God is starting to appear to your mind and your heart
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.760]   like a loving father pursuing you
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.320]   and having you as his child and the death of Jesus
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.040]   is no longer foolishness or a myth.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.400]   It's now precious and utterly needed.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   If this is happening, yield to it, yield to it.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   Give thanks that God is at work in your life.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.660]   Lean into this new condition with all your heart.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.240]   You are ready.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.520]   Don't resist.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.640]   Welcome the work of God when that is happening.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.480]   Jesus said, and I'm gonna quote now,
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.200]   Jesus said, "To all who received him,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.840]   who believed in his name,
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.360]   he gave the right to become the children of God,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.080]   who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.520]   nor of the will of man, but of God."
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.480]   And the last chapter in the Bible says,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.720]   let the one who is thirsty come.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.240]   Let the one who desires take the water of life freely
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.480]   without price.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.000]   It is absolutely free.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.600]   Come and drink.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.240]   So that's how you know that you're ready.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.720]   It is happening to you.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.120]   Find your eyes being opened to the beauty of Christ.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.380]   And just one last thought.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:13.340]   At desiringgod.org, there's a free book
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.160]   called "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ."
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.060]   It's the one book that I wrote explicitly
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.480]   with Carla-type people in mind,
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.680]   people who were on the outside looking in,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.320]   wondering, who is this Jesus?
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.980]   How do you get to know him?
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   And how might I be shown to be ready to become a Christian?
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.080]   Amen, yes.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.200]   And you can find "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ"
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.320]   at desiringgod.org/books.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.100]   And look for the title, "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ."
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.920]   You can keep up with the daily Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.800]   online or through our free apps, of course.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   For more, go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.960]   Well, tomorrow, a listener wants to know
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.460]   if God directs our lives in part
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.260]   through feelings of anxiety,
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.040]   which cause us to avoid certain choices,
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.060]   even non-sinful ones,
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.680]   should we be led by our anxieties and how?
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.960]   Pastor John will look at that question
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.120]   and a series of complex related issues
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.680]   and entanglements with it.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.720]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.960]   We will see you tomorrow.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
