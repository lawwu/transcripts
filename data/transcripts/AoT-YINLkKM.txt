[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   The path to becoming an astronaut is not clear.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.600]   The path was not clear for me either.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:15.200]   Dave Friedberg, this is Woody Hobart calling you from the International Space Station.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.320]   How do you hear me?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.920]   Hey Woody, I hear you well.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.400]   How are you?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.200]   22 years of experience living and working in space.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000]   We have learned so much.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.600]   And so what that sets us up to do now is to go further.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.280]   Space is hard.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.320]   It just is hard.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   It's not a forgiving place.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.080]   We intend to set up a sustained human presence on the moon
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.960]   and we're going to set up a proving ground to go to Mars.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:54.160]   Thank you so much.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.520]   It is such an honor to be here.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.560]   I'm going to start with a bit of history.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.000]   The left-hand photo is one of the last moments in recorded human history
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.320]   when all living humans were on earth.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.320]   This was October 31st of the year 2000 at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.160]   And the crew of Expedition 1 launched up to the International Space Station.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.000]   It was just three modules at that time.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.440]   And they started a continuous human presence in space that continues today.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   By 2011, the ISS was assembled and looked roughly like this.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.680]   Humans live in the pressurized modules running front to back in this photo.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.280]   And the truss running left to right is unpressurized.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.200]   So only accessible by spacewalk.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.520]   ISS is solar powered.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.800]   On an average workday, it consumes about 75 kilowatts.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.520]   It is a million pounds of mass in low earth orbit.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.680]   It's about 250 miles above earth.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.480]   To stay in that orbit, it has to travel five miles every second.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.640]   So that works out to a 90-minute orbit.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.840]   We see 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets every day.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.480]   Now in 2011, when the space shuttle retired,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.880]   it left us our only option to continue sending humans up to the space station
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.560]   was a Russian Soyuz rocket.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.960]   That situation changed in May of 2020.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.840]   SpaceX made history.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.960]   They launched NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.920]   on a test flight of the Crew Dragon spacecraft.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.160]   And at that time, the world was just two months in grappling with the COVID pandemic.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.320]   And All In had just published episode three.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.960]   Bob and Doug spent two months on the space station
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.480]   before they successfully returned.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.760]   And I didn't know it at the time,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.560]   but I would eventually fly on Crew Dragon Endeavor,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.480]   which is the same capsule as Bob and Doug.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.040]   Less than a year later, I was assigned to be the pilot for the Crew 6 mission
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   up to the ISS.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.560]   And so my crew from left to right,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.960]   on the left, Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedayev,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.000]   Commander Steve Bowen, myself flying as pilot.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.760]   And then Sultan Alnayati was the first UAE astronaut
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.320]   to do a long-duration mission, six months on the ISS.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.240]   We actually scrubbed our very first launch attempt.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.960]   We got within two and a half minutes of launch.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.840]   And we had an issue with the system that ignites our engines.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.240]   And so we had to scrub.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.680]   We got all the fuel off the vehicle.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.160]   And three days later, we were ready to try again.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:44.240]   You're on your back.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.040]   You lift off at about one and a half Gs.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:58.400]   By the time all the fuel burns out,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.080]   you're up about four and a half Gs.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.880]   And then we stage.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.800]   This is the second stage engine.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.360]   And again, it starts off with only a little bit of acceleration.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.120]   It builds up to about four and a half Gs.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.280]   And so 12 minutes after launch,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.480]   you're in space.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.080]   This is where we experience weightlessness
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.440]   for the first time.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.520]   And we took about a day, like 24 hours,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.000]   to do all the phasing up to the ISS.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.480]   For me, the ISS had been this place that I'd trained about.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.440]   It's kind of an abstract object off in space.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.560]   And actually arriving and seeing it in our thermal camera,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.720]   I still remember, sent chills down my spine.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.400]   It's pretty fun, the first few days,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.800]   getting used to weightlessness.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   Steve was our resident chef.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   He was famous for baking pies.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.960]   Baking pies in space.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   And we had a great handover with crew five,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.440]   who kind of taught us all the little tricks
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.680]   to living and working in space.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.200]   And we got right to work.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.880]   Full complement of science experiments.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.680]   This is the Japanese module.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.160]   You see the primary glove box mounted sideways.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.240]   And that's American astronaut Frank Rubio
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.200]   working in the glove box.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.520]   He currently has the American record
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   for duration of a single space flight.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.000]   Now, it turns out weightlessness causes heart tissue
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.680]   to age much faster than on Earth.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.600]   So we're using that as a model to study treatments
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.320]   for heart disease.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:25.120]   So I still remember the day that Sultan
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.320]   looked through the microscope and saw
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.280]   these beating heart cells.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.560]   Just mind blowing.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.720]   We printed a section of human meniscus
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.400]   using a biofabrication facility.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.760]   And in addition to all the science,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.320]   we have to do all of the maintenance and repairs on board.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.160]   So this is some of the less glamorous stuff.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.600]   This is fixing our toilet.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.560]   We have to do regular maintenance on the spacesuits
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.280]   to keep them ready for action.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.440]   Try to find me in this photo.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.360]   This is repairing one of our CO2 scrubbing machines.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.240]   You see my legs poking out.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   And this is how we get rid of trash.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.440]   We load up cargo vehicles and send them
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   home to a destructive re-entry through Earth's atmosphere.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.120]   There is a regular cadence of these cargo vehicles
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.440]   coming to and from ISS all the time.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.600]   Frank and I here are capturing the NG-19 mission
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.840]   with our Canadian robotic arm and berthing it
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.400]   to the bottom of Node 1.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.480]   And the team on the ground is always
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.440]   sending us with every new cargo vehicle fresh food.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.080]   It's always a special treat.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.840]   We also have to take care of ourselves.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.600]   This is Sultan on our treadmill.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.840]   It's mounted on the wall.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.680]   You run facing the floor.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.000]   We do like 2 and 1/2 hours of exercise every day.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.880]   Half cardio and half this resistance exercise.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.560]   So lots of time to listen to music and podcasts.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.960]   I did get to talk to Friedberg.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.720]   We had a great conversation, actually, from Low Earth Orbit.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.680]   I love chess, so I got a chess board sent up.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   And we actually played ISS Crew versus Mission Control.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.960]   We played a few games back and forth,
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.360]   did like one or two moves every day.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.400]   And we always picked out a flight controller
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.200]   from a specific console to make our moves on the board
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.680]   in Mission Control.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.720]   Now, one of my favorite parts of training, preparing,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.240]   was spacewalk training.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.720]   It's really tactile, learning to use a pressurized spacesuit.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.760]   So we have the Neutral Buoyancy Lab in Houston.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.440]   Amazing team of divers supporting us
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.480]   to practice all of our procedures.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.080]   And I was thrilled when I found out
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.920]   that I would get to do two spacewalks
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.360]   to install a couple new ISS rollout solar arrays.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.680]   They're the vertical rolls you see in this photo.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.360]   We were getting ready for the spacewalks.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.960]   And two weeks prior, we were flying over the Pacific Ocean
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.760]   and got some photos of this storm, which unfortunately
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.580]   damaged one of the ground sites in Guam
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.800]   that supports the satellites that we use
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.040]   to talk to Mission Control.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.880]   So this meant that during my spacewalks,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.080]   we would not have the ability to talk
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.600]   to Mission Control for some large chunks of time.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.000]   Everyone rallied.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.560]   Frank and Sultan set up this kind
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.440]   of command post in the US lab on the space station.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.400]   So in addition to operating the robotic arm,
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.800]   they would hand off back and forth
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.880]   with Mission Control for those comm gaps.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.680]   And Frank and Sultan would walk us
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.800]   through all of our procedures.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.840]   My friend Brian, who will be speaking shortly, actually,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.020]   told me that my mission would be an utter failure if I didn't
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.680]   get at least one space selfie.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.000]   So I got this as soon as I could.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.800]   Frank and Sultan flew me over to the arrays.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.320]   And Steve and I unbolted them.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.560]   And then this is the commute out to the work site.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.520]   The array unit, it's 800 pounds of mass.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.680]   So it's weightless.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.960]   But you still feel the inertia of that 800 pounds
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960]   in your hands.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.500]   So mainly, I was happy I did not drop it.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.960]   After we finished the installation,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.000]   Steve got this shot.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.520]   There's two Dragon spacecraft in this photo.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.440]   On the right side of Node 2 is Crew 6 Dragon Endeavor,
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.560]   what I flew up in.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.460]   And then up on the top is CRS-28.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.920]   That's a cargo vehicle that flew the arrays up.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.160]   And down in the end of the robotic arm,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.480]   you can see the foot restraint that was holding me
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.200]   while I was holding the arrays.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.400]   So it was an amazing mission.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.280]   After 185 days, it was time for Crew 6 to come home.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.160]   The Dragon hatch itself is closed.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.720]   That coming at 419 AM Central Time.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.640]   You see the thrusters firing as we back away and get
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.760]   another nice view of ISS.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.360]   Airspace 6 on the big loop.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.460]   Depart burn one is complete and nominal.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.100]   Sultan got this view past his feet of the plasma
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.020]   as we re-entered Earth's atmosphere.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.900]   We're basically inside a meteor.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.260]   Drogue pyros have fired.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.180]   And we have good confirmation of drogue chutes.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.740]   Two drogues.
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.340]   The drogue slowed us down to about 140 miles an hour,
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.180]   sets us up to deploy main safely.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.580]   And you can see here the hot spacecraft and cold parachutes
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.660]   in the thermal cam.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.720]   We landed in some of the highest seas to date for Crew Dragon.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.680]   An amazing recovery team comes out, they rig the vehicle,
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.880]   and they lift us onto the recovery ship
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.920]   with us still inside.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.320]   So you see our smiling faces here.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.120]   It was like the thrill of a lifetime
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.640]   to get to spend six months living and working in space.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.600]   But there's also just nothing like returning home
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.520]   to the people you love.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.240]   Thank you.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.580]   I want to spend just a moment beyond my mission
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.240]   and talk about where we're headed next.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.000]   NASA is headed back to the moon.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.200]   And to really put this in context,
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.160]   I just have to show you.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.940]   So I've asked Friedberg for some help, and he's kindly agreed.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.480]   Come on out.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.120]   For you.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.620]   OK.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.800]   Go on this side.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.500]   All the way down?
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.000]   Or--
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.920]   Stay with me for a second.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.420]   OK.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.000]   So it's a convenient quirk of the scale of the objects
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.120]   in our solar system that if you make the Earth a basketball--
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.200]   this is the Earth--
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.880]   then the moon is a tennis ball.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.920]   And I invite you, if you don't know this answer,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   to think about how far the moon is from Earth in this scale.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.860]   If you already know, that's fine.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.880]   But take a guess.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.240]   Should I say the answer?
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.160]   180,000 miles?
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.440]   225,000 miles.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.760]   225,000 miles?
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.260]   All right.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:21.800]   When should Friedberg stop?
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.280]   I'm not going to do very well on Jeopardy.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.840]   Here we go.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.280]   When should he stop?
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.400]   Now?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.600]   Keep going.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.040]   Keep going.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.520]   Keep going.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.600]   OK, slow down.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.640]   There.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.400]   So in this scale, it's 24 feet.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.040]   You can do the math.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.760]   So we will stay here.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.160]   Let's lose the tape measure.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.520]   And stay there, Friedberg.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   I would not make a good astronaut.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.400]   I was telling Woody, I'm like, I can't imagine you walk out
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.920]   in space, and it's like, there's just space?
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.420]   [BLEEP]
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.920]   That.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.240]   Like, I'm not-- sorry.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.960]   Go ahead.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.120]   Don't drop the moon either.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.600]   I just want to tell you a couple of things here.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.400]   This is the Earth.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.320]   I told you the ISS, where I was, was--
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.040]   I spent six months half an inch off the basketball.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.080]   That's where low Earth orbit is.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.740]   And you guys probably saw Polaris Dawn
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.880]   launched this morning.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.680]   Maybe a quick round of applause for SpaceX.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.920]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.140]   So they're going way higher than the ISS, way higher.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.900]   They're going an inch off the basketball.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.000]   With Artemis-- so we already launched Artemis in 2022.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.720]   It flew uncrewed out around the moon.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.200]   And the Artemis 2 crew is already
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.800]   in training to fly Orion around the moon and come home.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.880]   And then Artemis 3 is going to be the landing
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.040]   on the surface of the moon.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.320]   And we're going to set up shop.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.000]   We're going to make a proving ground to get to Mars.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.200]   And so while we have this scale, Mars--
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:57.960]   let's see.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.120]   If you could imagine 3/4 of a mile away in this scale,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.920]   3/4 of a mile, that's Mars.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   And we're doing all this work on the moon
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.080]   to eventually get to Mars.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.080]   And then-- I know you guys are forward thinking.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.640]   So I just want you to imagine beyond even Mars.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.760]   34 miles-- 34 miles away is Uranus.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:31.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.720]   I heard Shamov laugh.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.400]   He loved that.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.920]   Amazing.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.640]   All right.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.680]   I think we're going to talk for a minute.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.640]   Yeah, that was great.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.140]   Thank you.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:42.640]   Let's chat.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.680]   Grab a seat right here.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.720]   Grab a seat right here.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.040]   What should we do with the Earth?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.960]   Good question.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.240]   So a couple of quick questions.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.920]   What's the timeline, Artemis 2, Artemis 3?
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.520]   And yeah, just tell us a little bit about the timelines.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.360]   It's super exciting.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.560]   We already launched Artemis 1.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.840]   Artemis 2 crew is in training.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.480]   Right now, they're scheduled to fly in the fall of 2025,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.360]   so in a year.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.360]   They're going to test out the Orion spacecraft.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.280]   That flight's going to be a big deal.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.840]   They're actually going to go further from Earth
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.540]   than humans have ever been, because they
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.920]   go a little farther from the moon than Apollo did.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.420]   Wow.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.800]   And then the plan right now is for that first crewed landing
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.080]   in 2026 with Artemis 3.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.960]   2026.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.360]   Are you in the running to be--
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.920]   Yeah, every astronaut in the office
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.520]   is in the running to be assigned to an Artemis mission.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.760]   Is it like the movie "Right Stuff,"
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.140]   where you guys are all super competitive with each other?
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.060]   Tell us about the cooperative and the competitive nature
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.940]   of being an astronaut in the NASA program.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.640]   It's actually one of the most fun things.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.060]   So it's definitely kind of a wait
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.240]   in line till you're told that you're assigned to a mission.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.580]   I still remember when I got the phone call assigning me
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.940]   to Crew 6 to do my first mission.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.260]   It's just one of those phone calls you'll never forget.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.600]   It's actually not-- we all support one another,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.460]   and there's honestly nothing cooler
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.780]   than watching your friends fly to space.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.240]   And we all know we're eventually going to have that chance.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.100]   So it's less directly competitive
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.180]   than you might imagine.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.380]   So does the moon base kind of feel like an ISS?
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.980]   Is it like we're going to set up a facility at some point?
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.540]   And is that sort of long term planning going on?
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.380]   Absolutely.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.940]   And I think, yeah, there's a strategic plan looking way out
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.220]   into that Artemis campaign.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.020]   We talked about it being a sustained presence.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.300]   Right now, I mean, I think we'd all
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.900]   love to eventually have a permanent presence,
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.520]   meaning that humans are always on the moon.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.020]   At first, it's not going to be that.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.300]   We're going to send missions.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.940]   But unlike Apollo, we are really going to stay.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.100]   We intend to stay there for a long time.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.680]   And we're actually-- unlike Apollo,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.300]   instead of going to the equator, we're
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.220]   going to go initially to the South Pole, which
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.020]   is scientifically really interesting.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.300]   And the intent is to do all the cool things-- rovers,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.260]   moon bases, nuclear power on the moon.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.220]   We want to do it all.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.820]   Why did it take humans half a century
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.140]   to come back and do this again?
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.100]   I think--
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.800]   Did we really go to the moon, by the way?
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.760]   We absolutely went to the moon.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.220]   Just for the Joe Rogan crowd, I just want to make sure.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.480]   I think it's political will.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.440]   We have to decide that it's what we want to do.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.240]   And I think that's one of the coolest things about this time.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.460]   I mean, who's heard of Artemis program?
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.600]   Few people.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.040]   Good many.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.240]   We could probably do a better job advertising.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.280]   But you know what?
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.380]   The cool thing about Artemis is we truly
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.800]   have bipartisan support.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.360]   That's NASA's issue over many years
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.120]   is, can you sustain as administrations change?
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.000]   Because it takes a long time to do this stuff.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.280]   And right now, we feel like we have real bipartisan support
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.780]   to go do this.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.960]   The people want us to go do this.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.320]   And sorry.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.480]   And so once you're on the moon, there's
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.940]   a lot of constant resupply needed in the current model.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.240]   So that's part of the logistics.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.020]   It's like, how do we continually resupply?
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.440]   And I think as the missions get more complex--
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.760]   Is Starship involved in--
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.440]   100%.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.120]   So right now, we actually have two providers
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.620]   for--
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.780]   So SpaceX's big Starship.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.240]   Maybe you can just talk about why it's so important.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.000]   Yeah, I'd love to.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.400]   So we already talked about the Orion spacecraft, which
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.360]   is what the astronauts are going to fly from Earth
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.040]   to a lunar orbit in.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.560]   But the human landing system, which
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.400]   is going to take them down to the surface,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.140]   we have two providers for that and one of those.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.600]   And actually, the one we plan to use for that first landing
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.200]   is the SpaceX Starship.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.760]   SpaceX plans to do an uncrewed demo
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.480]   before we send our astronauts down.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.200]   And we're super looking forward to it.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.800]   So is Artemis a close partnership with SpaceX
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.400]   that NASA relies on, and SpaceX is a critical partner
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.800]   to that program, to that mission?
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.920]   We're using them for our landing.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.400]   Then SpaceX talks-- and Elon talked a lot yesterday
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.120]   about trying to get Starship uncrewed over to Mars
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.400]   in two years.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.780]   And I don't want you to necessarily opine
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.080]   in a negative way, but how realistic is it that there's
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.960]   going to be a crewed Starship to Mars in four years,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.540]   as he claimed?
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.560]   And is that a NASA partnership, or is that--
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.040]   We are cheering on every Starship flight.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.320]   I mean, I've watched every single one.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.840]   We love the development.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.160]   So if we can get to Mars in four years, that's great.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.440]   What NASA is specifically contracting SpaceX on
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.640]   is to go to the moon.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.320]   We believe the moon is the right place
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.760]   to go set up a sustained presence
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.320]   and really practice, set up a proving ground
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.920]   to eventually go to Mars.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.760]   But all the development on Starship
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.640]   is in the direction of goodness.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.700]   And does NASA have a development program
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.260]   on getting to Mars and timelines?
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.140]   Do they talk about that at all?
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.220]   And is there an actual mission yet?
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.500]   We actually reorganized within NASA,
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.620]   and we have an entire directorate called the Moon
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.500]   to Mars Directorate.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.540]   And so it's absolutely-- we see the moon as our path to Mars,
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.460]   and that is absolutely the strategy.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.620]   So maybe you could just tell us, coming a little bit closer
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.780]   to Earth, the Polaris mission.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.460]   It's five days long.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.660]   They just launched this morning.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.620]   Elon was here, and then he actually flew in,
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.140]   came to the summit, got back on his plane,
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.700]   went back to Florida, and they got off.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.100]   So maybe you could tell us a little bit
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.900]   about the mission and what these folks are going to be doing,
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.360]   because we didn't get to talk about it with Elon yesterday.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.060]   It's amazing.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.580]   And Jared, Scott, Sarah, and--
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.380]   Jared Isaacman.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.380]   Yeah, Jared Isaacman is the commander.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:20.880]   I mean--
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.420]   And he paid for the whole mission.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.540]   Yeah, he paid for the whole mission.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.420]   I mean, these guys are friends, actually, friends and family,
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.940]   so we're rooting them on.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.620]   If you've been to Florida and see--
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.860]   there's a different emotion when you see a crewed launch
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.900]   than an uncrewed launch.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.100]   Like, uncrewed launch, big rocket, go up, cool.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.140]   When you have friends and family on board one of these rockets,
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.220]   it's a different experience to watch the launch.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.980]   So we're rooting them on.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.660]   They're in space right now experiencing--
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.540]   And they're going to do a spacewalk.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.180]   They're going to do a spacewalk in a couple of days.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.260]   That's right.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.140]   It'll be the first commercial spacewalk.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.260]   So NASA's been doing spacewalks for a long time,
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.580]   but they are making history.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.500]   They're going to depressurize the vehicle to vacuum.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.300]   So they don't have an airlock or anything.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.860]   They're going to take the vehicle all the way to vacuum.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.660]   So they're all in a suit.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.660]   They're all going to be in suits.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.620]   They have to be.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.980]   They'll open the hatch.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.260]   And I think it's Jared and Sarah that
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.300]   are going to go out and do that first, I believe,
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.340]   do that first spacewalk.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.180]   So they're going to go out and be like,
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.700]   holy shit, I'm in space.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.980]   I'll say, I don't know that I'm not super up to date
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.740]   on the details of--
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.620]   I'm sure they have objectives for the spacewalk.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.780]   It's always how it is.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.300]   While you're out there, there's things you want to do.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.540]   Because I've got to imagine at the ISS, you walk out.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.980]   It's a large structure.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.780]   There's some grounding context to it.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.740]   But these guys are just outside of the capsule.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.620]   And I think another interesting--
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.860]   I had the benefit on ISS--
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.860]   I had been floating for months, actually,
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.300]   before I did my spacewalk.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.260]   So I was used to the idea that you're now in this world
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.060]   where everything floats.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.780]   And so going outside--
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.660]   I mean, you look down, and it's a 250-mile drop
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.460]   to the surface of Earth.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.860]   But it didn't feel scary or anything,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.100]   because I knew I was just going to stay floating next
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.420]   to a space station where everything's falling.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.180]   They've only had a couple of days to orient to this.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.900]   So it'll be pretty cool.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.460]   Yeah, well, I mean, cool for some.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.980]   It takes a different kind of person.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.380]   I don't know.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.180]   Really incredible.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.220]   Guys, please join me in thanking Woody for being here
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.140]   at the All in Summit.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.500]   [APPLAUSE]
