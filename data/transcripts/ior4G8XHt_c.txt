[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.360]   - Make war on the urge to sulk when you don't get your way.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.400]   This is such an important topic
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.840]   and I'm glad we can get to it today.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.600]   Pastor John, thank you for joining us
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.680]   over the telephone today.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.640]   The topic comes up in an email question
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.660]   from a podcast listener named Christopher
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.400]   in Seattle, Washington.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.120]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.800]   When I get angry in my home, I have a tendency to shut down.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.000]   I don't lash out in anger or cuss, I sulk.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.440]   I give my wife the silent treatment
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.040]   and I know this is wrong.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.000]   Please help me better understand how to communicate
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.520]   in my home in or shortly after conflict flares up.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.000]   I wanna lead well and reflect Christ more in my home.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.480]   And as a leader of your home,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.240]   what have you learned over the years?
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.040]   - Seven years ago, I took a leave of absence,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.600]   specifically about eight months in fact,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   specifically to do a self-assessment of my own soul
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.520]   and my family and my ministry.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.360]   I was still preaching and pastoring at the time.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.000]   I came back from that leave having put my finger
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   on five besetting sin of John Piper
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.920]   that I more or less count as corrupt,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.620]   fallen personality traits,
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.040]   which means no excuse.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.280]   They're just part of me.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.480]   And I've seen them for decades
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.920]   and it was just good to get a name on them,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.940]   isolate them, understand them, confess them.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.280]   And here they are, selfishness, anger,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.760]   self-pity, quickness to blame and sullenness.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.000]   And I mentioned this because when Christopher said sulking
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.680]   was one of his problems,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.780]   I think he means what I mean by sullenness.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.500]   So perhaps the most helpful thing I can do
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.800]   is to walk Christopher through my process
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   of self-understanding and how the Lord has helped me
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.000]   at least make some war on these protracted sins.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.220]   So let me name them and just put a sentence
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.260]   of description on each one
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.780]   so that we just let the ugliness,
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780]   it's so easy to describe our sins
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.340]   in a kind of self-excusing way,
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.880]   but if you name your sins and then define them,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.660]   it starts to look pretty bad.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.020]   So here's what I mean by the first one, selfishness.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.140]   And I got five things that characterize my selfishness.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.140]   My selfishness is a reflex to expect to be served.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.180]   My selfishness is a reflex to feel that I am owed.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.300]   My selfishness is a reflex to want praise.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   My selfishness is a reflex to expect things to go my way.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.020]   And my selfishness is a reflex to feel that I have the right
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.180]   to react negatively to being crossed.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.660]   And the reason I'm using the word reflex
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.980]   to describe selfishness is because
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.820]   there is zero premeditation.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.580]   I don't have to decide to be selfish.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.100]   When these responses happen,
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.100]   they're coming from my old nature, not from reflection.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.380]   They are the marks of original sin in my life
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.500]   and I am guilty for them.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.780]   Now, what happens when this selfishness is crossed?
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.300]   Here's where the other sins come in.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.940]   Anger, the strong emotional opposition
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.300]   to the obstacle in my way.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.760]   I tighten up, I wanna strike out verbally or physically.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   Next, self-pity, a desire that feels like I'm wounded
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.660]   and others can recognize in me that I want to be admired
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.900]   or pitied for my sense of being wounded,
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.620]   being mistreated by someone.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.220]   I want others to know it and recognize it,
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.060]   feel sorry for me.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.200]   Quickness to blame.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.220]   This is a reflex to attribute to others
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.020]   the cause of the frustrating situation I'm in.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.260]   Others can feel it in a tone of voice,
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.140]   a look on the face, a sideways query,
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.500]   an outright accusation.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.320]   And then lastly, sullenness or sulking,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.980]   the sinking discouragement, the moodiness,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.220]   the hopelessness, the unresponsiveness,
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.800]   the withdrawn deadness of emotion.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.940]   And of course, the effect on marriage
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.940]   is that my wife feels blamed and disapproved of
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.820]   rather than cherished and cared for.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.220]   Tender emotions start to die, hope is depleted,
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.220]   strength to carry on in the hardships of ministry wanes.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.620]   So that's my diagnosis.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.500]   Now, when Charles Wesley taught us to sing,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.100]   "He Breaks the Power of Cancelled Sin,"
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.900]   he was teaching the fundamental truth
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.660]   about how the cross of Christ
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.180]   relates to our battle with our own sin.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.180]   The cross cancels sins by faith
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.140]   for all who believe in Jesus.
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.140]   And then on the basis of that cancellation of our sins,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.380]   the power of our actual sinning is broken.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.220]   It's not the other way around.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.220]   There would be no gospel and no music
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.120]   if we tried to sing,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.400]   "He cancels the guilt of our conquered sins."
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.560]   That's not gospel.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.160]   First, the cancellation, then the conquering,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.080]   which means that the link between the cross
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   and my conquered sin is a Holy Spirit-empowered willing.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.960]   It works a willing in me.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.120]   Listen to these texts.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.480]   Romans 7, 6, "We died to that which held us captive
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.920]   so that we might serve in the new way of the Spirit."
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   So I serve by the Spirit because I died on the cross.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.000]   Or Romans 8, 13, "By the Spirit,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.280]   you put to death the deeds of the body."
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.720]   So I put to death by the Spirit.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   Or Galatians 2, 20, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.600]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.760]   and the life which I now live in the flesh.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.280]   I live by the faith of the Son of God."
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.920]   So I am living because I died and Christ is alive
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.520]   and a new I, which trusts Him, is alive.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.520]   And the most important one is Philippians 2, 12, and 13.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.320]   At least in my experience, it proved to be most important.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.600]   "Beloved, as you've always obeyed,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.500]   so not only in my presence, but much more in my absence,
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.840]   work out," or literally produce, bring about, effect,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.920]   "your own salvation with fear and trembling,
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.120]   for God is the one who is at work in you
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.920]   to will and to work for His good pleasure."
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.720]   In every single case of these texts,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   especially that last one, I'm working, I'm expending effort,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.280]   I'm willing, I'm serving, I'm putting sin to death.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.840]   My will is engaged.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.920]   But in every case, my will is empowered
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.400]   by the will of another.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.120]   So let me close with an illustration
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.740]   of how this has been working over, say,
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.440]   the past seven, eight years of my life
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.040]   in a more effective way.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.560]   And I really do feel that even today,
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.000]   seven years on from some of these key discoveries,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   God has given Noel and me fresh and new victories.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.340]   It was a Sunday evening, this was years ago
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.420]   while I was still in the ministry,
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.620]   about, what, I don't know, seven, eight years ago,
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.020]   when I was making these discoveries
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.660]   and trying to apply these things in a fresh way.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.340]   It was a Sunday evening, it was cozy, snowy outside.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.880]   Noel and Talitha and I were at home alone,
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.300]   and I was looking forward to something we could do together.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.660]   I had this expectation, and you know,
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.720]   discouragements and anger come from shattered expectations.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.620]   Talitha comes in from the dining room and says,
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.280]   "Mommy and I are gonna watch 'Supernanny' on the computer."
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.300]   And they set it up on the stool,
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.860]   they sit in the love seat together,
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   and they start watching it.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.020]   They don't even say anything to me.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.500]   They don't ask, they don't explain,
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.420]   they don't propose anything else or later,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.420]   and I feel, poor little John Piper,
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.020]   I feel shut out, ignored.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.620]   Now, at that moment, the old John Piper
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.940]   feels an enormous temptation to anger, self-pity,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.620]   blaming, sullenness, and that temptation, I think,
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.660]   is as dangerous for me, as big for me,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.380]   as some big sexual temptation.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.420]   So I immediately said in my heart,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.820]   because I had Philippians 2, 12 and 13 in my mind,
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.420]   that I'm supposed to work out my salvation here,
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.380]   I'm supposed to bring about victory over these sins,
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.540]   I immediately said, I said it, no,
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.540]   I said no to those rising temptations.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.220]   And I quietly, in the power of that no,
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.860]   which I, by the Holy Spirit, said to those temptations,
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.700]   I said no, I went upstairs without any flair of woundedness,
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.900]   I didn't like, in a poor, wimpy, wounded way,
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.580]   make them try to feel bad,
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.940]   I just quietly went upstairs to my study,
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.380]   and that's not unusual, and I made war.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.180]   I turned my mind and my heart,
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.980]   by the power of God in His Spirit,
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.620]   toward the promises of God, and the surety of the cross,
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.020]   and the love of my Father, and the wealth of my inheritance,
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.380]   and the blessing of that Lord's day,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.620]   which He had poured out earlier that morning,
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.220]   and the patience of Christ,
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   and the fact that my wife and daughter,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.980]   in their own minds, were not snubbing me,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.620]   and I held those truths before my eyes,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.220]   and I beat down the anger, and self-pity,
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.620]   and blaming, and sullen, I beat it down,
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.260]   and beat it down, until it died.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.340]   And later that night, I went downstairs,
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.100]   and I mentioned to Noel,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.180]   in a way I never would have been able to before,
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.180]   without any, you know, subtle innuendo,
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.500]   I mentioned to Noel, in a non-condemning tone,
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.580]   which was a miracle, that I was surprised
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.580]   that we didn't do anything together,
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.420]   and we just quietly worked it out,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.780]   and compared to the way things used to go,
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.500]   it was an amazing victory.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.860]   And yes, yes, yes, it would be far better
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.860]   if there were no war in John Piper's soul at all,
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.860]   against such rising selfishness, and self-pity,
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.020]   and anger, and sulking, and sullenness.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.420]   Yes, that would be better.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.020]   It will be that way in heaven someday,
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.100]   but oh, how I thank God
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.700]   that He breaks the power of canceled sin,
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   and He does it sometimes through our spirit-empowered battle
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.260]   with our own temptation in fear and trembling,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.460]   because God Himself is at work in us.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.060]   So that's what I pray for Christopher in his marriage,
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.500]   and his battle with sullenness.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.500]   Christopher, I pray that you would reckon
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.260]   your sin canceled, and then you would carry it
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.780]   into a room somewhere, and you would hammer on it
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.100]   for an hour by the promises of God.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.540]   - Amen, that's an incredibly helpful word, first of all.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.820]   Pastor John, thank you for this sobering glimpse
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.980]   into the warfare that you make
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.740]   on your own daily struggles with sin.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.820]   I appreciate your self-disclosure in the podcast.

[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.820]   to experience in this life?
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.980]   It's one of those questions that Christian hedonists
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.760]   have to answer, and John Piper will
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.100]   when we return on Wednesday.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.980]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
