[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   So the only other area of AI tools,
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.620]   are you using anything to record meetings?
[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.460]   Granola is the best.
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.260]   I like it because it sits outside of everything.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.200]   They are working on some functionality
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.160]   to let people know that you are recording them
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.100]   because you do have to get consent to record people.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.180]   In some states, right?
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.040]   In some states, yeah.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.540]   But it's just generally good practice.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.780]   But it sits outside of everything,
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.440]   meaning that you install at the OS level.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.460]   So if you're doing a Google Meet, a Zoom,
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.480]   any other meetings that you're doing anywhere.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.980]   And so it detects the audio has happened
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.380]   and it launches as, do you want to record this?
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900]   And it creates these beautiful summaries
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.120]   transcripts.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.060]   You can ask questions of the meeting afterwards.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.700]   And I think it's 10 bucks a month.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.060]   It's granola.ai.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.220]   I'm not an investor.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.580]   I would love to have been,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.260]   but I think it's one of the best out there.
