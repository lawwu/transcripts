[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   Well, the place of our loving sacrifice in relationship to our delight in God is a point
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.220]   of constant discussion when it comes to Christian hedonism.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.200]   So what glorifies God more, our self-sacrifice or our delight in God?
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.720]   The question today comes from a listener named Kobe.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720]   "Hello, Pastor Jon.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.360]   Thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.680]   My question is why you emphasize our joy in God as more vital to what most glorifies
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.440]   God than our love for God and for others.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760]   The greatest commandment is love, which sums up the whole law.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.520]   God is love, the Bible says.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.160]   God is not joy, not in the same way as he is love.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.940]   Isn't it better to say God is most glorified in us when we are most self-giving and loving
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.680]   towards others?"
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.840]   I think I would respond by asking this question.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.620]   Which is more vital to a rainbow, colors or light?
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:12.840]   Now, if you would have a hard time answering that question, maybe you would see why I would
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.340]   have a hard time answering the question, "Which is more vital to glorifying God, love for
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.600]   God or joy in God?"
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.760]   So let me see if I can unpack this illustration of the rainbow and then point to some biblical
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.500]   passages that might shed light on what I'm trying to say.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.120]   I'm picturing a rainbow as the event of God being glorified, and I'm suggesting that the
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.520]   colors of the rainbow correspond to loving God.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.400]   And I would go so far as to say that the colors in the spectrum of the rainbow—red, orange,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.220]   yellow, green, blue, violet—correspond to acts of the human heart which would constitute
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:20.960]   loving God, like admiration, adoration, submission, treasuring him, desiring to please him, desiring
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.680]   to be near him.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.480]   All of those acts of the heart, which are all more basic and more vital than any external
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.920]   movements of the muscles or the body, all those acts of the heart are all what love
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.600]   for God is.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.360]   If we love him, we admire him and adore him and submit to him and treasure him and desire
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.800]   to please him and desire to be near him.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.600]   Then in the analogy, I compare joy in God, not to the rainbow with its spectrum of colors,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.320]   but to light.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.440]   And the implication is this.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.520]   Light is essential—we could use the word "vital" to use Kobe's word—light is essential,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.720]   is vital to all those colors and thus to the rainbow itself.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.240]   No joy in God, no true admiration.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.960]   No joy in God, no true adoration.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.880]   No joy in God, no true submission.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.200]   It would only be legalistic.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.100]   No joy in God, no treasuring of God.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:45.200]   No joy in God, no desire to please him or be near him in a way that would honor him.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.160]   So I can't play off love for God and joy in God, because joy in God is what makes love
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.880]   for God love for God.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.200]   No rainbow without light.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.360]   No love for God without joy in God.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   In other words, what I'm trying to do in Christian hedonism, which is what I call this
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:17.320]   vision of reality that Kobe's asking about, what I'm trying to do in Christian hedonism
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.400]   is define what God-honoring love for God is.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.920]   Until we try to do this, it's just a word.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:36.480]   And I suspect that many people try to fill up the word, or they just default to filling
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.540]   up the word love with meanings that are not biblical.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.720]   They're not God-honoring.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.800]   What does it mean when Jesus says to love God with all your heart, which is deeper than
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.480]   all your mind, deeper than all your strength, deeper than all your soul, because it's the
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.140]   affectional animating center of the soul or the person.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.840]   And I think a lot of people answer this question by defaulting to something like John 14, 15,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:18.480]   "If you love me, you will keep my commandments," and misread it by saying that love consists
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   in self-sacrificing bodily activity of commandment keeping.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.880]   Because he said, "If you love me, you'll keep my commandments," which is emphatically
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.900]   not what he says.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.840]   He distinguishes love for himself and commandment keeping.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.680]   He says, "If you love me, then you will keep my commandments."
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.980]   They're not the same.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.920]   They're emphatically not the same.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.440]   They're not the same.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   They're different.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.800]   If you do one, the other will happen.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   Does not say love is keeping the commandments.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.540]   It says love is one thing, and if you do it, if you have it, then the commandment keeping
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.540]   will follow.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.540]   It will be the result.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:11.040]   There's something prior, something internal, something massive and deep and distinctive.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.300]   When I read the Bible words, "Delight yourself in the Lord," Psalm 37, 4, "Be glad in the
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.840]   Lord," Psalm 32, 11, "Rejoice in the Lord," Philippians 3, 1.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:35.480]   I hear God calling me, calling for a heart response to him that is essential to all other
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.240]   God-exalting responses.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.200]   In other words, if you try to pick out a kind of heart response to God and call it love,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:53.440]   like admiration or adoration or submission or treasuring or desiring, none of those would
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:03.640]   be authentic or God-exalting if delight in the Lord and gladness in the Lord and rejoicing
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.320]   in the Lord were stripped out of them.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.660]   You should try it.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.820]   See what happens to adoration and admiration and submission and treasuring and desiring.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:24.940]   If you try to conceive of them in a heart that does not find God himself delightful
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.340]   and satisfying.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:37.700]   So my answer to the first half of Kobe's question, "Why does Piper emphasize joy in God as more
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:44.940]   vital to what most glorifies God than love for God?"
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.260]   My answer is, I don't play them off against each other because they are not two different
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.740]   ways of glorifying God.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:01.860]   Loving God is the magnificent spectrum-laden rainbow that glorifies God, and the light
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.060]   of joy in God is what makes the rainbow the rainbow.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.980]   So when David says, King David in the Old Testament, when he says in Psalm 40, verse
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:19.820]   16, "May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:26.100]   May those who love your salvation say continually, 'Great is the Lord.'"
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:35.300]   He is showing that rejoicing in God and being glad in God is at the essence of what loving
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.900]   God and his salvation is.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.260]   Now we don't have time to adequately answer Kobe's second question, namely, "Why does
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:52.140]   Piper think that joy in God is more vital to glorifying God than loving people?"
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.220]   After all, Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before others so that they may see your
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.220]   good works," and those are clearly works towards people, love towards people, "that they may
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.180]   see your loving good works towards people, and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.180]   Yes and amen."
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:16.260]   Oh, that we might all do more loving acts towards people that God might get glory.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.020]   Now my answer to that question that he just asked is basically the same as my answer to
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.540]   the first half of the question.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.780]   Do all good works glorify God?
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.260]   Do not.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.220]   There are many good works that do not please or glorify God.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.780]   Hypocritical good works, selfish good works, self-exalting good works, all kinds of good
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:47.340]   works that do good for people that are sinful, don't have any God in them at all.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.660]   Though I give my body to be burned and have not love, I'm nothing.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.740]   Give away all I have to feed the poor and have not love, I'm nothing.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.580]   There are lots of good works that don't honor God.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.180]   Whatever is not from faith is sin.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:10.860]   And if I had time, I would argue, especially from texts like 2 Corinthians 8.2 and 9.7
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:19.420]   and Romans 8.12 and Hebrews 13.17 and Micah 6.8, that—I would argue this—that God-exalting
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:28.980]   love for people is the overflow of joy in God that meets the needs of others.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:36.620]   So it would be wrong to think in terms of joy in God being more or less glorifying toward
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:46.540]   God than love to people is glorifying toward God, because there is no such thing as authentic
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:55.040]   God-honoring love for people without joy in God.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:03.380]   So bottom line, in my Christian hedonism, delighting in God, being glad in God, rejoicing
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:11.700]   in God, being satisfied in God, all those biblical categories are not alternatives to
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.540]   loving God or loving people.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:21.420]   They are what makes love for God and love for people authentic, God-honoring.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.420]   Amen.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.100]   So many great texts here to study in this discussion.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.100]   Thanks, Pastor John.
