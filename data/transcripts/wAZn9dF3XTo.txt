[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.660]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.900]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.920]   Today, we are discussing journaling
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.220]   for mental and physical health.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.660]   I want to emphasize that today's discussion
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.380]   is not a general discussion about the value of journaling.
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.740]   Rather, it is a discussion
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.900]   about a particular form of journaling
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.300]   that the scientific peer-reviewed data says
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.140]   is especially powerful
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.540]   for improving our mental and physical health.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.800]   In fact, what I will describe today is a journaling method
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.980]   that is supported by over 200 peer-reviewed studies
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.660]   in quality journals.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.260]   And I frankly was not aware of this journaling practice
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.180]   prior to researching this episode,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.080]   but in researching this episode,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.500]   have come to discover that this practice
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.100]   should easily be placed among some of the other critical,
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.500]   so-called foundational pillar practices
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.100]   in terms of its impact
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.500]   on improving mental and physical health,
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.660]   including things like lowering anxiety,
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.300]   improving sleep, improving immunity
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.980]   to things like colds, flus, et cetera,
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.700]   as well as reducing the symptoms of autoimmune disorders,
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.940]   such as arthritis, lupus,
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.340]   and also providing some relief for fibromyalgia,
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.620]   which is a condition of excessive pain.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.360]   The particular journaling method and protocol
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.580]   that I will describe has also been shown
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.060]   to improve various metrics of everyday living,
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.580]   including improved memory, decision-making,
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.020]   and on and on and on.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.740]   So much so that, again, I was very surprised
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.660]   that I had not heard of this particular journaling method.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.840]   One would think that if such a powerful method existed
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.740]   that everyone would know about it,
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.560]   but it turns out that this particular journaling method
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.280]   has been somewhat cloistered
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.540]   within the fields of psychology and psychiatry.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.240]   It's not that nobody was aware of it.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.760]   In fact, I learned about it for the first time
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.540]   from our associate chair of psychiatry
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.100]   at Stanford University School of Medicine,
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.460]   my colleague and collaborator, Dr. David Spiegel,
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.660]   who, as some of you may know,
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.500]   has been featured as a guest on this podcast previously.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.060]   And upon hearing about it,
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300]   I decided to explore the primary research,
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.180]   that is, the studies that demonstrate the power
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.020]   of this particular journaling method,
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.780]   and was absolutely blown away by the positive impact
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.700]   this particular journaling method can have.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.180]   What's wonderful about it, you'll soon discover,
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.560]   is that it takes a relatively small amount of time.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.480]   In fact, it's something that you could do
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.920]   during the course of one week, or even across one month,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.620]   and then never do again.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.600]   And the data say that it would still have
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.820]   lasting positive benefits, both for body and mind.
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.140]   So while it's rare to feature one particular protocol
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.220]   as an entire Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.380]   that is indeed what I will do today.
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.660]   It is important that we go into some depth
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.140]   about the specific protocol,
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.680]   because there are some important details
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.600]   that everyone should know if they want to apply it
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.920]   and make it as effective as it can be.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.980]   And in addition to that,
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.740]   we'll talk about some of the underlying science
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.580]   that's been published,
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.280]   explaining why and how this protocol is so effective
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.020]   for mental and physical health.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.680]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.840]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.600]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.260]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.340]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.180]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.120]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.700]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.120]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.520]   That means plenty of electrolytes,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.660]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium, and no sugar.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.360]   The electrolytes are absolutely essential
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.200]   for the functioning of every cell in your body,
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.660]   and your neurons, your nerve cells,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.860]   rely on sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.500]   in order to communicate with one another
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.000]   electrically and chemically.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.180]   Element contains the optimal ratio of electrolytes
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.700]   for the functioning of neurons
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.140]   and the other cells of your body.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.960]   Every morning, I drink a packet of Element
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.600]   dissolved in about 32 ounces of water.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   I do that just for general hydration
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.920]   and to make sure that I have adequate electrolytes
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.440]   for any activities that day.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.280]   I'll often also have an Element packet,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.800]   or even two packets, in 32 to 60 ounces of water
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.320]   if I'm exercising very hard,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.220]   and certainly if I'm sweating a lot,
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.760]   in order to make sure that I replace those electrolytes.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.920]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.840]   you can go to www.drinklmnt.com/huberman
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.720]   to get a free sample pack with your purchase.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.620]   Again, that's www.drinklmnt.com/huberman.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.480]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.140]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.900]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.780]   I've spoken many times before in this podcast
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.180]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.900]   really is the foundation of mental health,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.480]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.640]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.020]   is to make sure that the temperature
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.760]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.340]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.000]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.720]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.840]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.780]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.480]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   With Eight Sleep, you can program the temperature
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.480]   of your sleeping environment in the beginning, middle,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.760]   and end of your night.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   It has a number of other features
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.760]   like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.160]   and slow wave sleep that you get.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.360]   Things that are essential to really dialing in
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.960]   the perfect night's sleep for you.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.560]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.080]   for well over two years now,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.120]   and it has greatly improved my sleep.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.920]   I fall asleep far more quickly.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.120]   I wake up far less often in the middle of the night,
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.920]   and I wake up feeling far more refreshed than I ever did
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.500]   prior to using an Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.900]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.920]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.440]   Now through November 30th, as a special holiday discount,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.880]   Eight Sleep is offering $500 off their bundles
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.280]   with a pod cover.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.320]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, the UK,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.760]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.860]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.880]   by Waking Up.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.660]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.800]   that includes hundreds of meditation programs,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.240]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions,
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.260]   and NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.560]   I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.300]   because even though I've been doing regular meditation
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.360]   since my teens, and I started doing yoga nidra
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   about a decade ago,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.480]   my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.240]   turned out to be the Waking Up app,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.280]   which could teach you meditations of different durations
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.760]   and that had a lot of different types of meditations
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.280]   to place the brain and body into different states,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.660]   and that he liked it very much.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.960]   So I gave the Waking Up app a try,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.400]   and I too found it to be extremely useful
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.420]   because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate,
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.160]   other times I have longer to meditate.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.320]   And indeed, I love the fact
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.880]   that I can explore different types of meditation
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.080]   to bring about different levels of understanding
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.660]   about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.280]   into lots of different kinds of states
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   depending on which meditation I do.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.640]   I also love that the Waking Up app has lots of different
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.480]   types of yoga nidra sessions.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.620]   For those of you who don't know,
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.200]   yoga nidra is a process of lying very still,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.480]   but keeping an active mind.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.640]   It's very different than most meditations,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.720]   and there's excellent scientific data
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.320]   to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.020]   called non-sleep deep rest, or NSDR,
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.020]   can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy,
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.520]   even with just a short 10-minute session.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.440]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.320]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.360]   and access a free 30-day trial.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.200]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.460]   to access a free 30-day trial.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.000]   Okay, let's talk about this particularly transformative form
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.580]   of journaling that initially was researched
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.080]   by Dr. James Pennebaker.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.120]   James Pennebaker was a professor of psychology
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.760]   at Southern Methodist University
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.120]   when he first started researching this form of journaling
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.500]   and its positive impacts on the body and mind,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.140]   but he has since moved to the University of Texas, Austin,
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.760]   where he still runs a laboratory
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.580]   and has continued his studies on the role of journaling
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.580]   and other forms of language, both spoken and written,
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.680]   in terms of their impact on one's mental
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.800]   and physical health.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.060]   So the origins of the research
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.120]   into this particular form of journaling
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.600]   started in the mid-'80s, and it was really in 1986
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.220]   that the first published manuscript
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.360]   about this form of journaling was published.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.560]   Now, I want to be clear that prior to James Pennebaker
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.600]   studying this form of journaling,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.820]   clearly others had used the form of journaling
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.200]   that I'm about to describe.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.860]   However, it was Pennebaker
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.060]   that really started attaching measurements
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.820]   of the specific types of changes that occurred in people
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.360]   when they did this journaling in a particular way,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.800]   and indeed came up with the precise protocol
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.220]   that we'll talk about today.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.640]   So Pennebaker and colleagues,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.560]   and James Pennebaker in particular,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.780]   really deserves credit for the discovery of this method.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.760]   As you'll soon learn, Pennebaker was absolutely meticulous
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.840]   in figuring out exactly how long
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.320]   the method should be carried out,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.140]   what exact forms of change occurred in the body
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.900]   and mind, he was careful to explore the method
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.220]   in the context of students,
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.880]   as well as in the general population,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.760]   in veterans, in elderly, in kids, and on and on.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.340]   So it's really that incredible attention to detail
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.040]   and that scientific rigor
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.180]   that makes the protocol so incredibly powerful.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.620]   So that first scientific study
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.340]   of this particular form of journaling,
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.120]   as I mentioned, was published in 1986,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.720]   and I provided a link to that study
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.140]   in the show note captions.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.420]   But what that study essentially consisted of
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.840]   was inviting undergraduate students
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.440]   into the university laboratory one at a time,
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.680]   and they were to spend 15 to 30 minutes writing
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.960]   about the most difficult, even traumatic,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.660]   or possibly non-traumatic,
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.940]   but still very difficult experience
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.780]   that they can recall from their entire life.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.560]   The instruction included that they should write
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.060]   for the entire time.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.860]   That is, because they were writing by hand
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.220]   in that particular experiment,
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.620]   that they were to not stop moving their hand
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.900]   for the entire duration of the 15 to 30 minutes.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.700]   And in addition to that, that no one besides them,
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.060]   the person writing, would see what was written
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.440]   at the beginning, middle, or even after the experiment.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.180]   In fact, the students were invited to tear up the paper
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.300]   at the end of the writing exercise if they so chose.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.780]   Okay, so the first key instruction
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.460]   is that they take a moment to think about
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.380]   what is the most difficult,
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.940]   perhaps even traumatic, experience of their entire life.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.880]   The second instruction was that they were supposed to write
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.740]   for 15 to 30 minutes.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.960]   And the third instruction was that they were supposed
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.780]   to write for the entire time.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.660]   That at no point would they take a pause,
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.580]   unless somehow emotionally or physically
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.820]   they were unable to keep moving their hand on the paper.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.520]   In fact, they were told to not pay attention
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   to accurate grammar, to not pay attention to re-readability.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.660]   They were told, in fact, that their writing could be replete
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.160]   with spelling errors or grammatical errors.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   That didn't matter.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.580]   What was most important is that they tap
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.040]   into a particularly negatively charged memory
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.940]   of their prior life experience.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.880]   Now, of course, because this was an experiment
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.980]   carried out in a university laboratory,
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.200]   there was a quiet place
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.180]   where the students could write undisturbed.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.400]   But since we're taking this particular protocol
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.280]   and we're exporting it to the real world
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.700]   through this podcast,
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.060]   so it's important that if you decide
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.560]   to implement this protocol in your own life,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.300]   that you carry out the writing
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.180]   in a place where you will not be disturbed
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.860]   for that entire 15 to 30 minute duration.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.580]   It's also important that you know
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.660]   that even though that first 1986 study
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.140]   was done having students write out these memories by hand
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.000]   with a pen and paper or a pencil and paper,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.700]   there have been many subsequent studies
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.180]   that have explored whether or not the pen and paper
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.700]   was particularly important, and it turns out it's not.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.000]   The exact same magnitude of positive effects are observed
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.780]   regardless of whether or not people write out
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.700]   their passage of words by hand
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.580]   or type it out on a word processor
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.360]   or any other form of writing.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.860]   Now, just to make sure that everyone gets
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.620]   the exact same protocol that was provided
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.780]   in that first initial study from Pennebaker and colleagues,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.260]   and that has been used really over and over and over again
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.900]   for more than 200 peer-reviewed studies
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.120]   that demonstrate the power of this protocol,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.140]   I'm going to read to you some of the specific instructions
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.940]   from that first study.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.920]   So the subjects were instructed to quote,
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.360]   "Write about something that you are thinking about
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.140]   or worrying about way too much,
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.200]   or if you're not thinking about
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.840]   or worrying about something way too much,
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.920]   perhaps you've deliberately tried to not think about
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.820]   this series of events or event,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.520]   something that you've been dreaming about at night,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.980]   perhaps in disturbing dreams,
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.300]   or something that you feel is affecting your life
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.200]   in an unhealthy way, either internally or externally."
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.020]   So it could be in your emotional state,
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.460]   your inability to calm down when you want to be calm,
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.000]   maybe you're ruminating, maybe even compulsive thought,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.140]   maybe it's leading to addictive
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.740]   or compulsive or habitual behaviors,
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.300]   or perhaps you can identify a specific trauma
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.300]   or set of traumas that you know
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.620]   are really plaguing your body and mind.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.840]   The specific instructions that were given to the subjects
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.740]   in those experiments are the specific instructions
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.340]   that I'm going to give to you now,
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.660]   should you decide to implement this journaling protocol.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.460]   And those instructions are as follows.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.380]   "I want you to write down your deepest emotions and thoughts
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.860]   as they relate to the most upsetting experience
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.280]   in your life.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.140]   Really let go and explore your feelings
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.840]   and thoughts about it.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.040]   As you write, you might tie this experience
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.440]   to your childhood, your relationship with your parents
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.120]   or siblings, people you have loved or love now,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.900]   or even your career or schooling.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.860]   How has this experience related to who you have now become,
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.440]   who you have been in the past
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.220]   and who you would like to become?"
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.040]   The instructions then continue to say,
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.820]   "Many people have not had a truly traumatic experience
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.880]   in their lives,
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.600]   but everyone has had major conflicts or stressors,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.080]   and you can write about the most dramatic
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.020]   or stressful experience you've ever had."
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.520]   Okay, so those are some of the key instructions
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.560]   that subjects in these experiments were given
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.120]   before they do the exercise.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.540]   And of course, they were given a few minutes
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.300]   to think about what they wanted to write,
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.540]   but once they selected what they wanted to write,
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.940]   they started writing.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.400]   There was a timer going in the background
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.600]   for 15 to 30 minutes.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.440]   And the reason, by the way,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.920]   I keep saying 15 to 30 minutes
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.980]   is that some experiments employed a 30-minute period,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.280]   other experiments employed a 20-minute period,
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.640]   others employed a 15-minute period.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.820]   Turns out there were no major differences
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.280]   between the 15-minute and the 30-minute writing blocks
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.140]   in terms of the positive impact that they had
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.760]   on mental and physical health.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.040]   But for some people and their particular experience
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.200]   that they're writing about,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.560]   15 minutes is simply going to be too brief a time
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.520]   in order to capture the entire experience
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.520]   and as many thoughts and feelings about that experience
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.160]   as one would perhaps put down onto paper
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.640]   or type out if they had a full 30 minutes.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.120]   So you can allow yourself 15 to 30 minutes
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.320]   and feel welcome to stop
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.440]   before the 30-minute period is over,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   or perhaps you're going to restrict yourself to 15 minutes
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.820]   and you're going to force yourself to get out
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.540]   as much as possible in that time.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.360]   It really doesn't matter or so say the data.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.620]   Okay, so before I continue to detail the specifics
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.560]   of this writing protocol,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.460]   you've probably already noticed that what I'm describing
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.700]   is a very different form of journaling
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.480]   than say morning notes,
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   which is a form of journaling that writers often use
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.940]   in order to quote unquote clear out the clutter.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.660]   This is a process of sitting down
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.680]   and writing down in stream of consciousness,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.080]   whatever's on your mind for the first five to 15,
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.920]   maybe even 30 minutes every morning
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.780]   as a way to sort of clear out your mental processes
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.400]   and get ready for the day,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.320]   perhaps a day of other forms of writing
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.280]   or other activities entirely.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.220]   What I'm describing is also distinctly different
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.280]   from so-called gratitude journaling.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.540]   In fact, it's quite the opposite.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.840]   It's not writing about things
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.040]   that you're grateful for necessarily,
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.540]   it's writing about things that are extremely unfortunate
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.380]   that happened to you
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.860]   and that you have very charged negative emotions about.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.120]   In addition, the form of journaling
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.080]   that we're talking about today is distinctly different
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.940]   from the form of journaling
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.360]   that I and many others have undertaken,
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.960]   perhaps not on a daily basis,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.940]   but perhaps on a daily basis
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.240]   where you essentially are writing out the contents
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.800]   of your daily life, a so-called diary.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.400]   And I mentioned that because I think many people do journal
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.840]   and some do so on a consistent basis.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.440]   I would put myself into that category.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.780]   Although the last few years
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.460]   I have not been journaling too much,
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.000]   I have literally stacks and stacks of journals
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.080]   dating back to the early '90s.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.600]   I brought a few of them along today
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.580]   and no, I'm not going to read them to any of you.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.680]   In fact, when I was looking at these last night,
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.600]   and by the way, these are from the late,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.520]   so this is summer of 1997.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.200]   So I would have been late in my undergraduate career.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   This is fall of '96, 1992,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.360]   always done on the same composition notebook at that time
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.340]   and always done by hand.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.280]   I'm surprised that my handwriting was as legible as it was.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.540]   It's gotten worse over the years.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.400]   I don't know what neural process that reflects,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.760]   but in any event, in reading over these journal entries,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.600]   it was clear to me that just as I had recalled
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.920]   that each and every one of them
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.240]   was essentially an update about what was happening lately,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.940]   what I was hoping for, some challenges,
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.040]   basically a diary of sorts.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.880]   And these are kept in the second drawer of the second,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.200]   no, I'm just kidding.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.720]   The idea for me is also that
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   no one will ever read these besides me.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.500]   It was quite an interesting exercise
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.440]   to go back and read those.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.480]   And yeah, there were a few cringe moments,
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.000]   but there were also a few moments
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.400]   where I found myself smiling because in certain ways,
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.260]   so little has changed between the person I was then
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.380]   and the person I am now.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.800]   And fortunately, in so many ways,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.440]   certain things have changed between the person I was then
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.000]   and the person I am now.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.100]   Now, I mentioned all of that simply because I think
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.800]   the form of journaling that I've been doing for some years,
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.520]   this sort of autobiographical approach to daily entries
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.760]   or pseudo daily entries is far and away different
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.280]   than the type of journaling that we're talking about
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.600]   for sake of improving mental and physical health
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.800]   during today's episode,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.700]   which is not to say that gratitude journaling
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.760]   or autobiographical daily entries,
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.740]   AKA diary type journaling is not useful.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.180]   In fact, there are data to support that gratitude journaling
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.880]   in particular can be very beneficial
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.700]   for both body and mind,
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.680]   everything from improving general states of happiness
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.560]   to reducing anxiety, improving relationships and on and on.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.400]   But to get back to the protocol
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.860]   that we're talking about today,
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.420]   you probably noticed that it is not a protocol
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.980]   that's likely to feel very good, at least not at first.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.040]   And indeed, that's what the research shows.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.480]   And this is something that you really need to be aware of,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.900]   that when subjects are given this research assignment,
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.180]   during the assignment, they are often quite distraught.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.680]   Oftentimes they cry, oftentimes they find themselves
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.820]   holding their breath and anxiety,
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.960]   oftentimes they'll finish that 15 to 30 minute writing block
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.520]   and they'll feel as if they had run a mental marathon
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.600]   and therefore the subjects were given a period
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.040]   of five to 15 minutes post writing
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.800]   to settle down and transition back into their day.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   So I highly recommend that you incorporate that
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.380]   into your protocol as well.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.700]   So if you're going to allow yourself,
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.440]   say 20 minutes to write,
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.020]   you'll want to give yourself probably 10 minutes
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.360]   of quiet time to bring your composure back
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.660]   and reset yourself so that you can reenter daily living.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.160]   Because the writing that you're going to do
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.800]   for this particular protocol
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.640]   is designed to tap into very negative,
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.020]   if not the most negative experiences of your life.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.960]   And so that's something to be taken seriously.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.520]   And it's an entirely unreasonable expectation
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.220]   that you could write about something as difficult
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.020]   as the most difficult experience in your life
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.340]   and then simply pivot and go back
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.040]   into everyday life right away.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.900]   So you'll want to designate a time of day or night perhaps,
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.280]   when you can do this writing
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.400]   and still allow yourself some time to settle down
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.560]   your autonomic system, return your breathing to normal,
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.180]   perhaps wash your face with some cool water,
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.720]   remind yourself that the rest of the day continues,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.660]   that you're doing great.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.460]   In fact, you made it through this first installment
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.080]   of the journaling exercise.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.760]   So you're probably starting to get the impression
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.620]   that this form of journaling that Pennebaker and colleagues
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.000]   really researched and pioneered the evolution of
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.840]   is quite different than other forms of journaling.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.540]   And in fact, it's very different.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.600]   I've already told you that the idea is to sit down
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.360]   and write for 15 to 30 minutes, write continuously,
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.960]   write about something that really to you is one of the most,
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.160]   if not the most difficult experiences of your life.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.000]   In addition to that,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.320]   for this form of journaling to be most effective,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.260]   that is to bring about the greatest positive shifts
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.120]   in mental and physical health,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.720]   you're actually going to write about that exact same thing
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.160]   four times.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.040]   Now, the way that that was initially researched
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.240]   by Pennebaker and others was to have the same person,
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.640]   of course, write about the same experience
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.340]   four times on four consecutive days
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.700]   for 15 to 30 minutes each.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.480]   So students or people from the general population
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   or veterans were literally coming into the laboratory
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.640]   and sitting down and writing about
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.400]   the most difficult experience of their life
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.800]   that they could recall for 15 to 30 minutes on one day,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.640]   and then again on the next day,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.360]   and then the next day and the next day.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.960]   So much of the data on this particular journaling method
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.420]   reflects that four consecutive days
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.840]   of 15 to 30 minute writing bouts
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.160]   of the most difficult experience that you can recall.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.980]   However, there have been variations on this protocol
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.800]   such that people selected one day per week,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.560]   and it doesn't even have to be the same day,
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.960]   like every Monday, it could be Monday of one week
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.700]   and then Wednesday of the next week and so on,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.540]   such that you write only one day per week
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.680]   about the most difficult experience you can recall,
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.420]   and then you write about that same difficult experience
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.080]   one week later, and then again one week later,
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.400]   and then again one week later across the course of a month
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.720]   or any four week period for that matter.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.080]   Now, I don't know about you, but when I hear that,
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   that I'm going to need to write about
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.500]   the most difficult experience of my entire life
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.880]   that I can recall for even 15 minutes,
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.200]   let alone 30 minutes, let alone two times,
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.560]   and here we're talking about four times,
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.400]   perhaps even on four consecutive days,
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.320]   that actually speaks to some intensity,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.800]   some demand, in fact, I find myself kind of leaning away
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.880]   from that experience a little bit,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.620]   but as we'll talk about later,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.160]   that's exactly the point of this type of exercise,
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.860]   which is that we are harboring these stories,
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.780]   these experiences, and in some cases, partial recollections,
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.580]   in another case, detailed recollections
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.000]   of the difficult thing that happened to us,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.800]   perhaps even the most difficult thing that happened to us,
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.600]   and those narratives exist in our nervous system.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   These are not necessarily traumas, as we talked about before,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.440]   although they can be traumas.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.360]   Now, we hear a lot about trauma,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.280]   and these days, people call all sorts of things trauma
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.840]   and traumatizing and say that they've been traumatized
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   by this or traumatized by that.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.720]   There's actually a specific definition of trauma
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.680]   that was provided by Dr. Paul Conte,
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.140]   who, as some of you know,
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.360]   is a medical doctor and psychiatrist.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.240]   He's been a guest on this podcast,
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.520]   first to talk about trauma.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.840]   He wrote a excellent book about trauma.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.980]   I provide a link to that book
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.880]   in the show note captions, by the way,
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.400]   and he and I did four episodes of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.600]   a so-called guest series,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.900]   specifically aimed at mental health, what it is,
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.260]   how to build mental health, specific protocols,
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.480]   and Dr. Paul Conte is really truly a world expert in trauma,
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   and he defines trauma as any experience or experiences,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.160]   plural, that modify our brain and neural circuitry,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.560]   so it could be brain or body or both,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.300]   such that we do not function as well emotionally,
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.520]   behaviorally, or cognitively going forward
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.100]   from that experience, okay?
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.020]   So not everything constitutes a trauma, but many things do.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.760]   So applying that definition,
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.160]   I think it's fair to say that many, if not most people,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.660]   have some form of trauma stored in their nervous system,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.460]   and other people perhaps don't have such traumas,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.420]   but everyone has had stressors.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.520]   In fact, I think it's fair to say
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.160]   that everyone has had major stressors in their life,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.200]   provided that they've lived it all.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   That's just part of life, unfortunately,
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.260]   or maybe fortunately,
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.560]   maybe it makes us who we are in positive ways
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.500]   if we are able to transmute those negative experiences
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.200]   and stressors or traumas into particular forms of learning
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.320]   that allow us to do better, and indeed, that's possible,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.660]   and that was discussed with Paul Conte
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.960]   in that four-episode series on mental health.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.220]   But the particular form of journaling
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.740]   that we're talking about today was really designed
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.160]   to have people focus on those difficult experiences,
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.080]   and then for four episodes total, yes, total,
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.200]   there's no ongoing every week,
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.700]   or it's not like having to seek out sunlight every morning
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.920]   and getting sunlight in your eyes,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.060]   or trying to get the best possible night's sleep at night,
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.880]   like I'm always encouraging people to do.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.900]   This is really a short-term protocol,
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.920]   but it's one that is indeed very intense.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.720]   Okay, so along those lines,
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.280]   that deliberately journaling
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.500]   about a particularly distressing experience
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.760]   or set of experiences is likely to bring some degree of
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.040]   sadness, anxiety, frustration, anger,
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.120]   perhaps other emotions as well.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.400]   It's important that you know some of the data
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.960]   that have been collected about this journaling protocol.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.400]   One of the more important features of this protocol
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.620]   is that when people do it,
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.680]   they tend to bin out into two different groups,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.320]   and these two groups have been described
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.480]   as low-expressors and high-expressors.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.700]   Now, low-expressors and high-expressors have nothing to do
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.520]   with introversion and extroversion.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.560]   That's actually been looked at,
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.160]   and they have no relationship, okay?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.360]   So some people who are very talkative and very extroverted,
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.300]   they could be a low-expressor,
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.260]   somebody who's very introverted,
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.280]   tends to only share when they really have something to say
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.160]   and maybe doesn't have a lot of interest
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.240]   in social interactions,
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.040]   or as some of you who heard the episode on relationships
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.920]   know, an actual introvert is somebody
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.220]   who really enjoys social interactions,
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.780]   but they are very sated.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.720]   They are very satisfied by less social interaction
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.120]   than are extroverts, okay?
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.160]   If you want to learn more about that,
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.560]   check out the episode I did on relationships.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.480]   But in any event, when people sit down to do this exercise,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.860]   and when they consent to having their writing analyzed,
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.000]   and when they undergo a number of other different tests,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   turns out there are two different groups that segment out.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.400]   The first are these low-expressors.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.800]   The low-expressors tend to use less descriptive language
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.960]   in their writing.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.440]   They tend to get less emotional
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.580]   during the first bout of writing,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.320]   that first day of 15 to 30-minute writing.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   Whereas the high-expressors tend to be people
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.840]   that use a lot of negative language
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.740]   to describe their negative emotions
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.140]   about the negative experience.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.400]   So that means more negative descriptor words were used
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.940]   at higher frequency.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.560]   These people, when they have their physiology measured,
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.080]   also tend to have higher amounts of distress and upset
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.560]   in the first bout of writing,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.580]   that first 15 to 30-minute episode.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.940]   So we've got two different groups.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.440]   The low-expressors and the high-expressors.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.700]   The low-expressors on day one are sharing a bit less.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.500]   They're expressing less on paper
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.440]   of their particular emotions that they can recall
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.180]   from that traumatic or very distressing event.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.760]   And overall, based on physiological measures as well,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.360]   so cortisol increases as well as skin conductance changes
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.980]   and heart rate and blood pressure,
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.900]   the low-expressors are effectively relatively more calm,
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.720]   less distressed as they write
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.900]   about this very stressful event in their lives
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.420]   relative to the high-expressors
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.480]   who have higher blood pressure, higher heart rate.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.820]   They tend to be the ones that cry more
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.500]   or hold their breath more or sob more.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.100]   They have a higher levels of cortisol
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.680]   during that first round of writing.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.180]   Now, for the protocol to be effective,
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.760]   it doesn't matter if you're in the low-expressor
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.180]   or high-expressor group.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.480]   Here's what's interesting.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.320]   I just mentioned that on day one,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.920]   the low-expressors are less distressed physiologically
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.780]   and psychologically as they write about this for them,
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.140]   very distressful event,
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.040]   whereas the high-expressors are much more distressed,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.500]   significantly more so, in fact,
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.780]   when these are measured in laboratory studies
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.620]   on both mental and physical dimensions of stress.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.140]   Now, that's on day one,
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.620]   but then what's observed is an opposite pattern
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.680]   of progression such that the low-expressors
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.820]   become more and more distressed
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.140]   as the writing exercise continues
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.060]   from day two, three, and four.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.280]   Whereas the high-expressors,
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.780]   these people that use a lot of language
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.000]   to communicate their distress
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.860]   and are experiencing a lot of physiological
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.740]   and emotional distress as they're writing on day one,
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.060]   their amount of distress from day one to two
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.520]   to three to four actually goes down more dramatically.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.980]   So you can expect that you fall into one or the other group.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.300]   This was truly a binary distribution
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.000]   where people binned out into one or the other
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.380]   based on a number of different measurements.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.840]   But here's the good news.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.220]   It turns out it doesn't matter
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.080]   whether or not you're a low-expressor or a high-expressor.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.620]   You want to use the form of writing
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.540]   that's most natural for you
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.740]   and that, for you, communicates
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.360]   what that negative experience was like
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.940]   and how it has affected you
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.180]   and perhaps how it's affected others as well.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.480]   The important thing to know is that both groups,
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.740]   both the low-expressors and the high-expressors,
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.120]   benefit from this journaling protocol
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.760]   such that three weeks later and even three months later
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.340]   and even years later,
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.020]   both groups are experiencing far less distress
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.920]   and baseline levels of stress
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.200]   than they did prior to embarking on the journaling protocol
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.440]   at the very beginning.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.980]   Now, the reason I mentioned these two groups,
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.060]   the low-expressors and the high-expressors,
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.700]   is that it's a non-trivial detail of this writing protocol
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.100]   because some people are very familiar
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.980]   with communicating their emotions,
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.660]   both in writing and perhaps in speech as well.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.980]   And this actually has been looked at.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.980]   There's a wonderful study also by Pennebaker and colleagues,
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.100]   and I should mention that even though he studied
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.380]   these journaling protocol for a good number of years,
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.120]   his laboratory has evolved now
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.020]   to studying all sorts of things
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.480]   related to how the particular language usage patterns
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.560]   that people use in everyday speech
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.700]   as well as in their writing,
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.460]   how that reflects their underlying psychological tone
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.580]   and emotions, but also, and I find this so interesting,
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.580]   how the particular words that we use in writing and speech
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.100]   actually shape in a causal way our emotional state.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.060]   So I'll talk a little bit about that later,
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.300]   but the important thing to focus on now
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.280]   is the results of this study entitled
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.020]   Natural Emotion Vocabularies as Windows
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.060]   on Distress and Well-Being.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.660]   And this, again, is a study
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.300]   that was done by Pennebaker and colleagues,
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.260]   I've linked to in the show note captions,
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.740]   and it essentially examines
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.700]   people's natural language usage patterns.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.220]   Now, what do I mean by natural and why is that important?
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.140]   Well, there have been many, many studies
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.220]   of people's vocabulary and assessing
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.700]   whether or not people have more knowledge of negative words
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.740]   to describe negative emotions or positive emotions.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.900]   These studies are varying in their form,
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.700]   but generally consist of having people
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.080]   circle words they recognize
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.160]   or maybe writing out the definitions to,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.420]   and it turns out that people that have
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.840]   more extensive knowledge of words
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.880]   that describe negative emotions themselves
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.020]   tend to have a lower affect or negative emotional state
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.300]   as compared to people who have more extensive knowledge
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.900]   of vocabulary words that pertain to positive emotions.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.140]   So a crude example of what I just described
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.040]   is somebody that has fairly limited knowledge
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.560]   of words that describe positive emotional states.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.360]   So perhaps they recognize the word happy,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.100]   they recognize the word ecstatic,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.760]   they recognize the word joyful,
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.160]   but they have a fairly limited word set
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.820]   that pertains to positive emotions.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.420]   Whereas by comparison,
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.460]   this is always relative within the same person, right?
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.180]   By comparison, the person knows four times more words
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.260]   that pertain to a negative emotional state, okay?
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.020]   In general, those people tend to be more depressive,
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.740]   tend to have higher levels of anxiety and so forth
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.460]   as compared to somebody where the reverse pattern is true,
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.460]   where they have knowledge of far more words
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.540]   that pertain to positive emotional states
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.740]   as compared to negative emotional states.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.580]   Now on the face of it,
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.840]   that result probably seems straightforward, right?
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.160]   People that have a lot of words to describe happiness
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.000]   are more happy.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.820]   People that have a lot of words to describe sadness
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.520]   and negative emotions are more sad,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.480]   but it didn't necessarily have to be that way.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.240]   And it turns out that it's not always that way.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.360]   Well, the particular study that I've been describing here,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.720]   this natural emotion vocabularies
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.840]   as windows on distress and wellbeing is an important paper
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.860]   because it explored not the words
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.020]   that people have knowledge of,
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.380]   but the word patterns that people tend to use
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.720]   in their natural speech, either spoken or written.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.800]   And what Pennebaker and others showed
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.060]   is that people that tend to use a lot of negative words
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.760]   tend to have more negative emotional states.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.780]   Whereas people that naturally tend to use words
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.980]   that describe positive emotional states
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.900]   have more positive emotions.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.660]   And this related to both mental and physical metrics
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.680]   of negative emotions and positive emotions.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.200]   So this is a significant result
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.080]   because what it says is that our knowledge
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.460]   of vocabulary words is, while interesting
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.400]   and perhaps important for other things,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.920]   is not nearly as important as which particular words
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.840]   we use on a frequent basis.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.360]   And so, whereas before I said,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.320]   okay, if you're going to embark on this protocol
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.440]   of four writing sessions, 15 to 30 minutes each,
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.700]   that you should not monitor your writing,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.280]   that you want to sit down, start writing
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.500]   and just don't stop.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.980]   You don't want to pay attention to grammar
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.640]   or spelling or anything else.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.920]   And then after the fourth writing session,
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.080]   you don't look at what you've written for at least a week,
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.840]   but then a week or more later,
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.040]   you go back and you read what you've written,
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.960]   paying careful attention to the number of words
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.000]   that you use that reflect a negative emotional or affect,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.520]   as it's sometimes called, state in the first
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.880]   versus the second versus the third
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.380]   versus the fourth journal entry.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.880]   Now, this might seem a little bit detailed
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.200]   and reductionist for a protocol
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.660]   that we would discuss on this podcast here.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.760]   We're really talking about you doing
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.900]   your own data analysis of self.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.460]   But if you think about it, a practice like this,
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.680]   both can be very quick and highly informative.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.880]   So for instance, you can go back
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.240]   and simply circle all the words that at first blush to you,
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.140]   appear to reflect a negative state
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.160]   and put a square around all the words
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.280]   that just by your read seem to reflect a positive state,
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.000]   and then compare them across those four journal entries.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.120]   And of course, you can opt to not do any of this,
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.100]   but what people find,
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.740]   that is what was discovered in the research literature,
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.380]   is that on average, the patterns of language use
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.260]   from the first to the fourth entry shift dramatically,
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.940]   such that by the fourth entry,
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.820]   people, even though they're still writing
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.460]   about the same negative experience,
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.820]   are writing about that experience in a very different way.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.960]   Not only are they naturally using fewer negative words
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.460]   to describe their recollection
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.980]   and experience of that negative event,
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.180]   but the number of positive words is also increasing.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.700]   Now, this is important because when Pennebaker
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.220]   and colleagues gave the instruction
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.960]   to people to do this protocol,
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.500]   they encouraged them to think about three things
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.380]   before they ever start writing.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.400]   The first is, of course, to write about facts
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.460]   about that difficult experience.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.660]   I think that's sort of obvious,
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.460]   that when people are going to recall a difficult experience,
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.720]   they're likely to write down facts about that experience.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.960]   The second thing that they wanted to remind them to include
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.600]   were emotions that they felt at the time of the experience,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.820]   as well as emotions that they happen to feel now
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.360]   about that experience.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.080]   And third, that people include writing
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.040]   about any and all links that come to mind,
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.720]   about the negative experience
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.840]   and things that may be happening today
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.460]   or plans for the future,
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.840]   people from the past, present or future,
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.220]   really any link, no matter how distant it might seem
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.700]   or how random it might seem,
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.820]   to include that in the writing, okay?
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.440]   So just to repeat the three things
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.180]   that they were instructed to include
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.460]   before they ever set their pens to paper
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.440]   or started typing out their negative experience,
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.080]   first, facts about the hard experience.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.500]   So whatever they can recall that happened
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.600]   in that hard experience,
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.240]   or perhaps it was something that didn't happen
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.660]   and that was why it was a hard experience,
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.260]   but facts related to that hard experience,
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.900]   facts of the hard experience.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.240]   Second, that they include writing about emotions felt
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.060]   at the time of the experience,
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.380]   as well as emotions felt now
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.460]   while writing about that prior experience.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.620]   And third, to include any writing
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.080]   about any links that spring to mind
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.660]   about the negative experience
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.780]   and anything that's happening now
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.120]   or perhaps happened in the past
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.160]   or things that you have planned for the future.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.920]   Now, that third category of links between the experience
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.720]   and other things may be direct and obvious.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.560]   Maybe these are real aha moments where you go,
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.840]   "Oh my goodness, I realize now that what's been happening
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.460]   "for the last six months is a direct mirror
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.760]   "of what happened in that earlier traumatic
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.420]   "or very stressful episode."
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.820]   Or perhaps the links are more opaque.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.580]   Maybe the link is, "I don't know why,
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.300]   "but I keep thinking about this one experience that I had
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.800]   "and I keep thinking about this one person
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.560]   "and I don't know how they're linked."
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.240]   That's fine, put those down on paper.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.640]   You could even draw a diagram,
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.400]   but I should mention it is important
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.440]   that you try to the best of your ability
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.980]   to write things out in complete sentences.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.960]   Again, they don't have to be perfect grammar
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.840]   or even pseudo perfect grammar.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   The spelling can be off, your handwriting can be a mess.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.920]   Although if your handwriting is truly a mess,
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.160]   it might be hard to read later.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.760]   By the way, folks, my older sister always teases me
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.100]   that my handwriting is frozen in the third grade.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.180]   Actually, I would like to show her my journal entries.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.820]   My handwriting was actually quite a bit better
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.960]   than it is now, which basically speaks
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.300]   to some degree of cognitive decline for me.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.520]   But in any case, the point is that this third category
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.460]   of establishing links between the prior negative experience
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.360]   and whatever else is an important component
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.840]   of the writing protocol.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.380]   So whatever it takes to include those links,
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.840]   they are worth including.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.540]   Now, I want to reemphasize that even though I pointed
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:07.200]   to the positive health benefits of using more positive words
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.180]   in one's writing or speech, as opposed to negative words,
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.940]   which tend to be associated with worse health outcomes,
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.640]   both in terms of physical and mental health,
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.360]   it is important and it's central to this writing protocol,
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.300]   if you're going to get the positive consequences of it,
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.280]   that you're not monitoring the words
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.560]   that you're using too closely.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.820]   You're not trying to write this so someone else can see it.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.580]   You're not trying to write the great American novel.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.080]   You're not writing your eulogy.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.200]   You're not writing your autobiography.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.240]   You're really writing this for you.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.960]   I can't emphasize that enough.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   You're doing this writing protocol
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.880]   so that you can work through something
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   that is stressful or traumatic,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   that resides in your nervous system,
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.240]   and that is not serving you well.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.440]   Indeed, next, we're going to talk about what happens
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.740]   when these narratives of our prior negative experiences
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.160]   are not worked through,
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.160]   that they have not been put either to speech
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.080]   or to pen to paper or typed out.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.880]   And perhaps more importantly,
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.920]   we're going to talk about the incredibly positive benefits,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.560]   both at the level of neural changes,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.700]   so-called neuroplasticity,
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.680]   which is the literal rewiring of neural connections,
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.940]   as well as psychological benefits, reduced anxiety,
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.820]   improved mood, improved sleep,
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.080]   and improved immune function that are the consequence
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.020]   of doing this four bouts
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.640]   of 15 to 30 minute writing protocol.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.540]   As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course,
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.800]   our physical health, but also our mental health
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.660]   and our cognitive functioning, our memory,
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.020]   our ability to learn new things and to focus.
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.200]   And we know that one of the most important features
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.560]   of high quality nutrition
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.140]   is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.740]   from high quality unprocessed or minimally processed sources
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.840]   as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.900]   to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.760]   including the gut microbiome.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.880]   Now, I, like most everybody,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.940]   try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.680]   ideally, mostly from minimally processed
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.140]   or non-processed foods.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.240]   However, one of the challenges
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.100]   that I and so many other people face
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.160]   is getting enough servings of high quality fruits
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.100]   and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.300]   that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.340]   That's why way back in 2012,
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.180]   long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.780]   And so I'm delighted that AG1
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.940]   is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.680]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.980]   and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.760]   is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.720]   That is, it provides insurance
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.500]   that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals,
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.180]   probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.340]   physical health, and performance.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.780]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.040]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.580]   to claim a special offer.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.340]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.180]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.520]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.380]   to claim that special offer.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.060]   Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the positive mental
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.400]   and in particular physical changes that occur
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.780]   in people that do this writing exercise.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.940]   I should mention that most of the studies,
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.260]   and again, more than 200 quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.620]   of this protocol have been carried out
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.140]   and are still ongoing, not just in Pennebaker Laboratory,
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.840]   but in many, many other laboratories as well,
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.780]   reveal that the positive physical shifts
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:28.660]   that occur in people that complete this four bouts of writing
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.520]   in the way I described
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.500]   is both significant and long lasting.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.780]   Now, of course, it is not the case
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.740]   that these four episodes of writing
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.620]   can completely cure major forms of depression
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.240]   or post-traumatic stress disorder,
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.580]   although they have been shown to benefit,
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.860]   that is to reduce depressive symptoms
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.000]   and to reduce the symptoms
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.420]   of post-traumatic stress disorder considerably,
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.780]   but they shouldn't be considered complete therapeutics
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.020]   for those conditions.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.400]   However, they have been shown to significantly improve
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.580]   many other health metrics.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.380]   And I alluded to some of these
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.480]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.320]   There have, for instance,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.540]   been studies of this type of journaling protocol
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.700]   for people that have been suffering from chronic anxiety
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.380]   and insomnia, and indeed,
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.380]   they experienced significant relief.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.740]   As well, people who have suffered from arthritis,
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.920]   people who are going through cancer treatment,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.900]   people who have lupus, which is an autoimmune disorder,
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.140]   report significantly improved symptoms,
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.380]   not necessarily cured from those conditions,
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.140]   but significantly improved symptoms
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.640]   as a consequence of doing this writing protocol.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.060]   In addition, and earlier I mentioned this, I realized,
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.200]   but I'll mention it again,
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.980]   people suffering from fibromyalgia,
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.900]   which is a chronic pain condition
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.660]   that is or can be very debilitating,
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.900]   has shown significant improvement in symptomology
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.820]   that has reduced chronic pain
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.680]   after they do this four bouts of writing
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.940]   in the way that I described.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.020]   And again, the relief from pain seems to be ongoing.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.980]   Again, not a total cure of their symptoms.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.140]   I don't want to provide false hope here
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.060]   or overblow the positive impact
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.000]   of this particular writing protocol,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.740]   but nonetheless, statistically significant shifts
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.140]   that were pervasive over time.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.000]   In addition, people suffering from IBS,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.780]   or irritable bowel syndrome,
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.900]   have achieved some significant degree of relief
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.320]   of their symptoms relative to people
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.060]   who also have irritable bowel syndrome,
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.780]   but who do not do the exact same protocol
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.420]   that we're talking about today.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.620]   Now, of course, in all of these studies,
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.120]   we're not talking about people
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.900]   that simply do this writing protocol
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.160]   as compared to people that don't do the writing protocol.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.800]   Pennebaker and others, of course, are excellent scientists,
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.180]   and so they provide adequate control conditions.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.880]   The control conditions, in most cases,
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.140]   were to have people also do 15 to 30 minutes of writing,
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.480]   but to do journaling in the more conventional manner
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.880]   of autobiographical report of what they've been up to lately
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.420]   or what they plan to do.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:55.100]   In fact, very much like my journal entries from college
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.500]   and in the year subsequent to that.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.600]   So it's important to understand
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.520]   that what we're talking about today is a journaling protocol,
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.700]   which seems somewhat conventional,
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.400]   but the exact protocol is highly unusual,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.100]   as we've been talking about throughout today's episode.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.780]   And in addition, all of the data that we're discussing
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.220]   in terms of positive mental and physical effects
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.220]   are data that were established relative,
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.540]   that is, are statistically significant
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.480]   as compared to a control group
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.900]   that also wrote for an equivalent amount of time,
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.260]   tended to write out an equivalent number of words on average,
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.660]   and yet we're writing about something quite different
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.960]   than the people that were in
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.520]   the so-called experimental group.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.120]   So it's important to keep in mind
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.280]   that we're not simply talking about phenomenology here.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.980]   We're talking about scientific studies
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.120]   where very specific measurements of the experimental group,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.140]   that is the group that did this particular form
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.240]   of writing about something very distressing
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.980]   or even traumatic four times, 15 to 30 minutes per time,
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.580]   relative to a control group
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.320]   that did nearly the equivalent form
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.460]   of mechanical processes of writing,
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.700]   but that the specific emotional content
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.900]   related to that writing
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.360]   was the major variable that differed.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.180]   In fact, that is one particular strength
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.340]   of the protocol we're describing today,
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.900]   that if you think about it would be very hard to do
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.220]   in a study, say, of physical exercise,
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.060]   where you have people perhaps run on a treadmill,
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.980]   getting their heart rate up to 85%
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.920]   of their maximum heart rate for 30 minutes, five days a week,
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.780]   you would expect that that group,
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.000]   compared to a group that did nothing,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.900]   would experience significantly greater shifts
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.540]   in positive health metrics like lowered blood pressure,
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.240]   certainly not during the exercise bout.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.140]   During the exercise bout,
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.740]   you can bet that their blood pressure and heart rate
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.180]   went way, way up, but that, of course,
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.200]   afterwards they would adapt to that exercise
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.960]   by having a resting heart rate that was lower
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.700]   than any group that did nothing or that walked on a treadmill
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.180]   but it's actually very hard to think about a control group
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.900]   that would provide real equivalence
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.780]   of time spent and effort spent,
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.980]   but that would differ only on one variable,
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.920]   which would be heart rate.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.060]   You could probably come up with something
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.300]   but it'd be very difficult to do,
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.140]   whereas in the studies that we're talking about
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.820]   during today's episode,
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.860]   essentially everything was the same, right?
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.040]   People are still writing, they're still sitting,
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.200]   they're still doing it for the same amount of time.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.700]   It's simply that the content of the writing is different
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.440]   at the level of the emotional tone of the subject
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.280]   that they're writing about,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.320]   which I find both exciting and personally quite motivating
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.020]   to do the sort of protocol that I've described today
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.180]   because it leads to such dramatic shifts in health
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.280]   across a huge range of dimensions,
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.160]   both in people suffering from certain conditions
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.300]   and people who are not suffering from certain conditions.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.080]   And then the question becomes why?
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.140]   What is actually happening at a physiological level
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.540]   that can explain all of these incredible psychological
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.140]   and physical positive shifts that occur?
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.580]   Okay, so as with any protocol
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.580]   that's shown in many, many studies,
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.460]   again, here are more than 200 peer-reviewed studies
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.280]   to have positive effects on mental health or physical health,
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.580]   can imagine that there's going to be a constellation
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.260]   of positive effects that occur
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.820]   that can explain, say,
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.260]   the improvement in autoimmune conditions
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.860]   or the improvement in anxiety,
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.540]   that is a reduction in anxiety,
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.580]   or the improvement in sleep patterns.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.440]   It's not going to be just one thing.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.860]   However, there are some general categories
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.300]   of physiological changes that have been observed
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.280]   in people that do the particular protocol
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.900]   we're talking about today
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.220]   that I think can explain a great number
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.460]   of the mental and physical shifts that occur.
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.300]   Now, one of the more important studies in this area
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.340]   that's been published, and here, again,
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.940]   this is a paper by James Pennebaker,
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.160]   but I don't want to give the impression
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   that he's the only person or the only laboratory
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.720]   that's looked at this particular writing protocol.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.120]   Many others have as well,
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.620]   and I'll provide links to some of those
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.020]   in the show note captions.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.780]   But this particular study I'm about to describe
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.500]   explored how the disclosure of traumas
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.540]   or the writing out of very stressful experiences
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:53.700]   impact immune function at the level of specific cell types
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.500]   of our immune system that are challenged
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.840]   in a way that mimics the sort of challenge
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.380]   we would experience if we were to be exposed
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.340]   to a bacteria or virus.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.760]   Now, without getting into a detailed lecture
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.200]   about immunology, and by the way,
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.480]   I did an entire episode of the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.220]   about immune function and the brain some years ago,
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.500]   and you can find that by going to hubermanlab.com.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.900]   Just put immune system into the search function.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.220]   It will take you to that episode
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.240]   and to any timestamps of other episodes
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.900]   where I touch on the immune system
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.160]   or protocols related to immune brain function.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.780]   In the meantime, this particular study
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.660]   is very interesting and worth highlighting
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.660]   because what they did was to essentially have people
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.920]   do the exact same protocol that we've been describing
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.580]   throughout today's episode.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.740]   But they also included blood draws
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.860]   from the subjects in those experiments.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.620]   And they collected that blood from subjects
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.620]   both before and after the writing episodes.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.300]   In fact, they took the blood at 15 weeks prior to the study,
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.780]   and again, six weeks into the study, okay?
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.440]   Now keep in mind that people were completing
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.020]   the writing exercise over the course of,
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.080]   at a maximum, four weeks,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.740]   but they were still monitoring these subjects
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.660]   in terms of their psychological and physical health
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.660]   after the final writing exercise.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.820]   That was a key component of essentially all of the studies
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.060]   of this particular protocol.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.980]   They'd assess people before they did the writing assignment,
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.900]   they assessed people during the writing assignment,
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.420]   and they assessed people often long
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.080]   after the writing assignment was completed,
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.340]   even years after the writing assignment was completed.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.480]   So in this particular experiment,
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.540]   they're drawing blood 15 weeks before
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.940]   and six weeks into the study.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.760]   Six weeks into the study is after all of the writing,
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.660]   that is the four bouts of writing, have been completed.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.820]   They also divided subjects in this study
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.060]   into people that were so-called high disclosures.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.460]   So these are people that revealed a lot
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.660]   about their particular traumatic or stressful episode
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:44.780]   in their writing, and people that were low disclosures.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.460]   They also included a control group,
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:47.980]   and the control group was essentially
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.500]   as I described before.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.620]   It consisted of people that also were doing journaling
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:53.920]   for the equivalent amount of time,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.620]   as people that were in the experimental group,
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.820]   but that were not writing about a traumatic
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.460]   or stressful experience.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.500]   Now, the basic takeaway of this study is as follows.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.700]   They take the blood.
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.620]   They are able to isolate from the blood
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.540]   something called T lymphocytes.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.380]   T lymphocytes are an essential component
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.300]   of your immune system.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.140]   These are cells that many people describe
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.580]   as white blood cells.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.840]   They are manufactured in the bone marrow,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.260]   which I still find amazing, right?
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.220]   We think of bone as just these like, you know,
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.720]   hard components of our body and our skeleton
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.700]   that allow us to be upright and to be rigid
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.200]   and to move about and, you know, not be, you know,
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.880]   jelly-like, but indeed in the center of the bone is marrow,
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.820]   and the marrow itself is performing
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.400]   an important physiological role, many roles in fact,
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.180]   one of which is to create these T lymphocytes
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.180]   or white blood cells.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.020]   They actually are born of the bone marrow,
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.740]   but then they mature in a structure called the thymus.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.640]   The thymus is an organ that sits essentially
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:54.040]   behind your sternum, and it's there that the cells
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.720]   that originate from the bone marrow are matured
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.560]   into what are effectively white blood cells,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.620]   which are essentially cells that go out
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.520]   and combat infections, bacterial infections,
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.720]   viral infections, even fungal infections.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.240]   Now they combat infection not alone,
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.700]   but in collaboration with other immune cell types
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.600]   that you can learn about, again, in that episode
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.740]   I did about the immune system and the nervous system.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.140]   If you choose to go listen to it, and even if you don't,
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.220]   here's what you need to know about this study.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.080]   In this study, what they found is that when they took
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.740]   the blood from these subjects, isolated those T lymphocytes
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.220]   and then challenged those T lymphocytes
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.240]   with something that mimics an infection,
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.320]   and they did that with something called concanavalin A.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.720]   Concanavalin A is what's considered a mitogen.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.440]   It's something that activates T lymphocytes,
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.060]   and it activates what are called natural killer cells.
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.520]   Now that's a lot of detail for sake of this episode.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.880]   Basically what the concanavalin A is doing
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.400]   is it's mimicking an infection,
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.080]   but in this particular study, this is all being done
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.640]   on T lymphocytes that have been collected,
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   they're put into a dish, and then they're exposed
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   to different concentrations going from low to medium to high
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.560]   of that concanavalin A, mimicking a low grade,
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.920]   moderate, or severe infection.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.640]   And what they observed in this study is remarkable.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.380]   I mean, to me, this just still blows my mind.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.580]   People that did this four bouts of writing protocol
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:30.080]   experienced greater degree of T lymphocyte activation
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.000]   from the concanavalin-mitogen challenge,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.060]   which mimics infection, then did people who wrote
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:41.260]   about something that wasn't stressful or traumatic.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.500]   Now that itself is pretty striking, if you think about it.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.840]   I mean, we're talking about a writing exercise
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.600]   that generates an emotional state
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.760]   versus a writing exercise that does not produce
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.960]   as negative or intense an emotional state.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.440]   And we're talking about a significant effect
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.860]   on the immune system or the mobilization of immune cells
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.000]   in response to an immune challenge.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.080]   In addition to that, however,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.400]   they observed that high disclosures,
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.920]   that is people that really poured themselves
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.760]   into this writing protocol,
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   experienced a greater degree of immune activation,
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   that is a fighting off response to this mitogen,
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.860]   concanavalin A, then did people that were low disclosures.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.680]   So this really speaks to the fact that the intensity,
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.940]   the emotional state during the writing exercise
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.460]   is having a significant impact on the immune system
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.880]   at the level of something as basic and yet as powerful
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.860]   as how much deployment of immune response
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.180]   there is to an infection.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.940]   Now, the field of so-called psychoneuroimmunology
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.960]   has been around for more than 30 years.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.280]   In fact, if you don't apply standard definitions
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.800]   to that field, it's been around for thousands of years.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   But really it's only in the last 10 years or so
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.980]   that scientists and physicians,
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.540]   at least standard scientists and physicians
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.960]   have started to really adopt the understanding
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.120]   and really apply to their studies
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.420]   and their clinical practice this firm idea
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.360]   that the body and mind are linked in this way,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.920]   that emotions can really shape our physical responses
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.160]   and that physical responses also can shape, of course,
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.640]   our mental responses.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.020]   Now, I'm not trying to be disparaging at all
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.360]   of traditional science or medicine.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.920]   It's just that until recently,
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.940]   these fields have existed more or less as silos,
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.360]   people that studied bodily organs
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.760]   versus people that studied the brain,
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   people that studied emotions and psychology
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.040]   versus people that studied the immune system.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.800]   And there's been some crossover,
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.160]   but by and large, it's been very siloed.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.080]   Now, I mentioned this because if you look into the history
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.120]   of why James Pennebaker and colleagues
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.520]   started exploring this particular pattern of journaling,
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.640]   it actually relates to his own personal experience.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.000]   And I don't want to spend too much time on this,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.280]   but it's worth mentioning that Pennebaker
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.180]   has actually spoken about and written about in, by the way,
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.120]   an excellent book that I've linked to
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.520]   in the show note captions,
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.120]   where he talks about his experience in suffering
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.800]   pretty severely from asthma as a child
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.300]   and that that asthma was seasonal.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.220]   And yet at some point later in his life,
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.360]   because he had certain relatives visiting him
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.940]   in his new home location,
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.540]   that his asthma would come and go
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.220]   as a consequence of interacting
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.540]   with certain members of his family independent of season.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.780]   And basically what he deduced
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.540]   from his own personal experience
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.980]   is that there must be some link between our emotions,
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:28.300]   either negative or positive, and our immune system
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.580]   or other physical ailments or thriving
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.540]   in the physical sense.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.000]   Now, he certainly wasn't the first one
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.980]   to come up with that hypothesis,
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.040]   but indeed he was one of the first
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.740]   to really start exploring a protocol within the laboratory,
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.700]   an experimental protocol that could really tap
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:47.340]   into high degrees of emotionality,
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.000]   in this case, negative emotions,
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.200]   and the consequence of that on physical health outcomes.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.380]   And this study that I mentioned
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:57.220]   is but one of those examples.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.620]   And in that way, he's truly a pioneer
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.560]   in thinking about, quote unquote, psychoneuroimmunology,
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.460]   but couching it not in the direction that most people do,
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.720]   which is, for instance, there've been lots of studies
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.560]   where people have said,
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.220]   okay, and people that are chronically stressed,
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.140]   which includes, of course, psychological stress,
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:15.060]   what are the effects on the nervous system,
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.740]   the immune system, et cetera?
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.760]   And as you could imagine, in general,
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.100]   people who were more stressed over long, long periods of time
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.560]   had worse physical outcomes,
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.660]   and people who were less stressed
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.560]   had better physical outcomes.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.820]   But the protocol that we're talking about today
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.140]   is quite a bit different.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.220]   So if you step back and think about,
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:32.220]   it's a little counterintuitive.
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.620]   What Pennebaker essentially did was to have people
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:38.540]   deliberately induce a negative experience,
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.820]   and yet they're seeing positive physical health outcomes,
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.580]   or in this case, positive effects on immune system function.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.300]   So that leads to the question of what's really happening
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.980]   during and after these four episodes of writing.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.220]   And that's where things get especially interesting
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.820]   as it relates to the nervous system and to neuroplasticity,
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.640]   or the nervous system's ability to rewire itself
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.180]   in response to experience.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.220]   So that's what we're going to talk about next.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.340]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.760]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.220]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.900]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.540]   to help you better understand your body
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.300]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.060]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.900]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.140]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.980]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.080]   A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.460]   however, is that you get information back
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.340]   about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.380]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.580]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.520]   because they have a personalized platform
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.080]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.580]   metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.460]   but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.780]   that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.420]   supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.640]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.300]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:58.500]   go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.740]   For this week only, meaning now through November 26th,
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.760]   InsideTracker is offering 50% off all bundles
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.740]   and 30% off all other tests.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:10.120]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.780]   Okay, so what's happening at a mechanistic level
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.360]   that allows people who do these four bouts of writing
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.560]   about something traumatic or stressful
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.460]   to achieve these long-lasting, positive shifts
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:22.280]   in mental and physical health?
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.740]   Now, there could be any number of different changes
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.660]   occurring at the level of the mind or body,
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:28.680]   but what we're talking about here
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.260]   is trying to find the pivotal one,
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:33.880]   or sometimes referred to as the linchpin mechanism,
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.660]   that when one taps into that mechanism,
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.180]   it wicks out into all these different systems
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.020]   of the brain and body
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:43.220]   and provides all of these different positive benefits.
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.860]   Now, in researching this episode,
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.300]   I thought long and hard about this
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.420]   and came up with a short list of ideas.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:50.620]   And as is always the case,
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.220]   people have worked in this area on this particular protocol
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.620]   and protocol similar to it
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.660]   in the field of psychology and neuroscience,
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.820]   have also generated their own short list.
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.240]   And those short lists converge
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.720]   at the level of one particular mechanism
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.060]   that is worth describing.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.580]   And that one particular mechanism
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.620]   is anchored around the concept of neuroplasticity,
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:12.280]   that is our nervous system's ability to change
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.820]   in response to experience.
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.660]   And if you've heard me talk about neuroplasticity before,
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.220]   neuroplasticity in childhood occurs
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.740]   through rather passive experience of any sorts of events.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.620]   In fact, one of the hallmarks of childhood
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.900]   is that just the mere exposure to an experience
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.500]   reshapes the brain, not necessarily permanently,
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.620]   but often in a way that is very long lasting.
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.920]   Now, that's a feature of childhood,
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.540]   because if you think about what the nervous system
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.900]   is really designed to do for us,
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.300]   it's of course what allows us to move our limbs,
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:44.020]   it's what allows us to have a heart rate
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:44.940]   that goes in the background
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.380]   without us having to think about it,
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.900]   so-called autonomic functions,
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.060]   it's what keeps us breathing
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.940]   without us having to think about it, and on and on.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.340]   But one of the main functions of the nervous system
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:57.080]   is to be a predictive machine,
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.960]   to make good guesses about what's to come next.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.740]   And one of the ways to make really good guesses
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.860]   about what's to come next
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.900]   is to take a certain period of life that we call childhood,
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.060]   superimpose on that period of life, that childhood,
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.740]   what we call a critical period or sensitive period,
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.820]   during which our experiences
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.100]   create a sort of map within us
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.860]   that allow us to predict, okay,
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.900]   well, if this person's in the room later,
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.480]   well, then that's likely to happen.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.380]   Or if those people are in the room,
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.020]   any number of different things could happen,
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.540]   but of one particular category of experience
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.380]   as opposed to another.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.840]   That's really what your nervous system does.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.620]   It becomes a prediction machine,
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.580]   and it becomes a prediction machine
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:38.180]   by drawing strong correlations between emotional states,
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.920]   your physical surroundings,
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.500]   your perception of who's there, what's there,
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.220]   what happened just prior to something,
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.820]   and how it made you feel later.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.280]   So when we talk about recounting
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.240]   a stressful or traumatic event,
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.680]   if you recall, there were three components to it.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.100]   It involved facts about that experience,
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.500]   so literally who was there, what happened,
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.700]   as to the best of our recollection.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.680]   If you recall the second thing,
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.140]   it's also about recounting how that experience
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.660]   made you feel at the time and how it makes you feel now.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.660]   And then if you recall,
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.860]   the third thing that's critical to include,
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.460]   it's about any links or associations
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.600]   between what happened and really anything at all.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.480]   So if you think about it,
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.260]   all three of those things in that list
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.660]   are really about tapping into your neural map
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.020]   or your schema, as it's sometimes called,
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.820]   or your internal representation,
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.080]   both conscious and unconscious,
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.260]   of what happened during that stressful or traumatic event.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.280]   Now, a hallmark feature of traumas,
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.820]   as well as a hallmark feature of addictions,
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:39.040]   as well as a hallmark feature of compulsive behaviors
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.460]   or negative habitual behaviors,
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:46.460]   and negative habitual states like chronic stress, anxiety,
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.840]   the sorts of things that trigger insomnia,
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.720]   the sorts of states of body that trigger immune compromise
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.400]   and give us autoimmune
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.520]   or other types of immune system challenges,
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.520]   are that a certain component of our nervous system
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.040]   and our brain in particular are less engaged
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.320]   than they normally would be in the healthy condition.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.980]   Now, I want to be clear
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.560]   that in any one of these conditions,
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.120]   whether or not it's irritable bowel syndrome
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   or it's fibromyalgia or it's chronic anxiety or depression,
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.660]   there are many, many different brain centers and networks,
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.700]   that is stations within the nervous system
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.800]   of the brain and body that are involved.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.160]   I really want to emphasize that this,
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.420]   there's no one location in the brain, for instance,
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.840]   for fear or anxiety, it's always a network phenomenon,
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.980]   the relative activation of different brain centers
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.640]   at different times and so on.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.160]   But with respect to thinking about traumas
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.140]   and stressful experiences, we have to ask ourselves,
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.120]   what is it about the emotional states
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.320]   and all the mapping, the representation
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.280]   around those emotional experiences
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.420]   that would somehow impact our immune system,
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.600]   like our thymus of all things, or our bone marrow?
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.920]   Or conversely, what would it be about a stressful experience
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   that would impact our heart rate
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.480]   that would somehow then also change our brain?
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.400]   So the mechanism that seems to be a sort of smoking gun
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.200]   of sorts, that is the mechanism that really does seem
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.600]   to be at least one of those linchpin mechanisms,
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.760]   is that when we experience very stressful
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.840]   or traumatic experiences, our prefrontal cortex,
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.660]   the neural real estate that's just behind our forehead,
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.800]   which has several different subdivisions, in fact,
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.600]   is reduced in its overall levels of activity
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.860]   and other areas of the brain that sometimes are referred to
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.280]   as the limbic areas of the brain,
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.200]   although if we were to be more accurate than that,
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.280]   the modern neuroscience really refers to these
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.120]   as subcortical structures.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.360]   They aren't necessarily limbic structures per se,
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.200]   although they can include components of the limbic system,
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.240]   so they can include things like the hypothalamus,
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.200]   so this dense collection of neurons that resides
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.720]   over the roof of your mouth that's involved
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   in things like aggression or temperature regulation,
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.560]   sleep-wake cycles, and so on,
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.820]   as well as structures that perhaps you've heard more about,
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.840]   such as the amygdala, which is involved in threat detection,
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.260]   but other structures as well, all of which are subcortical.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:57.920]   Now, those subcortical structures can be compared
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.520]   in a fairly general but still accurate way
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.320]   to the prefrontal cortex,
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.920]   which is involved in contextual planning,
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.680]   involved in assessing outcomes.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.200]   If I do A, what will happen?
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.120]   If I do B, what will happen?
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.320]   The prefrontal cortex is also associated
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.760]   with our self-concept of our identity,
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.720]   who we are, what we are about, what we value,
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.000]   what motivates our decisions to do or to not do things.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.320]   So I don't want to create any false impressions
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.360]   that the prefrontal cortex is somehow
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.000]   a more evolved structure than these subcortical
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.340]   and limbic structures, but in some sense, it is.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.080]   It's involved in more, quote-unquote,
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.240]   "sophisticated functions," or at least functions
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.600]   that involve us really thinking
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.320]   and being able to place a coherent narrative
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.120]   of what happened in the past, what's happening now,
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   and what's likely to happen in the future
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.880]   if conditions A, B, or C happen to arise, okay?
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.520]   So that's a very brief top-level contour lesson
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.220]   in prefrontal cortical function and comparing it a bit
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.240]   to some subcortical and limbic structure functions.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.480]   Now, there have been neuroimaging studies,
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.320]   in particular studies by the Lieberman Laboratory
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.300]   at University of California, Los Angeles,
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.960]   but neuroimaging studies in other laboratories as well
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.160]   that have established that when people recount
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.200]   very stressful or traumatic events,
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   the prefrontal cortex level of activity is reduced
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.880]   as compared to when people recall less stressful
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.880]   or less traumatic events.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.040]   In addition to that, those subcortical structures
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.560]   ramp up their activity when people recall traumatic events,
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.720]   at least at first, okay?
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.360]   This is very important.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.160]   What I'm about to tell you is that the repeated visiting
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.800]   of stressful and traumatic events in a structured way,
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.240]   or even in a pseudo-structured way,
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.620]   as is the case when people first start journaling
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.280]   about that stressful or traumatic event on day one,
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.920]   when it tends to be a pretty unstructured narrative,
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.000]   that's actually been shown in the literature,
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.960]   and then over the course of that second and third
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.560]   and fourth writing bout,
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.240]   people not only shift the sort of language that they use
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.240]   to describe their feelings in that event,
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.780]   as we talked about earlier,
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.040]   but the degree to which there's a more coherent narrative
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.980]   placed on the structure of that writing increases
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.760]   with each subsequent bout of writing.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.120]   And this is very important
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.760]   because what we're really talking about here
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.860]   is people going deeper into their recollection
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.920]   of the experience,
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.040]   not remaining at such a superficial level.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.280]   And two things are happening,
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.800]   even though they're going deeper
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.560]   into this very distressing event,
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.560]   they're perhaps even experiencing
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.240]   heightened levels of distress, right?
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.760]   If you recall back to earlier in the episode,
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.600]   when I talked about people
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.880]   who tend to be on the low disclosure end of things,
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.140]   they're not very verbose,
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.700]   they don't tend to use a lot of emotional words,
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.000]   and early on, they're not sharing too much
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.440]   about this experience, and over time it increases,
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.200]   whereas the other group decrease the level of emotionality
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.080]   with each subsequent writing bout.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.320]   But in each case, the coherence of the narrative,
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.440]   that is, the degree to which the narrative
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.400]   takes on a story-like structure,
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.800]   increases from the first to the fourth writing bout.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.160]   And this is very important
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.160]   because what we're really talking about here
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.040]   is increasing the amount of truth-telling,
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.800]   the honesty around the experience.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.920]   And when we say honesty,
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.880]   I'm not talking about any prior debate or ongoing debate
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   about what happened during those experiences.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.200]   Remember, when people do this protocol,
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.520]   you're recalling what happened,
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.460]   what were the facts in your mind?
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.360]   What were the facts?
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.200]   What happened?
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.080]   What didn't happen perhaps is relevant too,
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.220]   but what happened?
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.740]   Second, how did it make you feel?
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.360]   That's something that you are uniquely qualified
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.800]   to answer factually,
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.420]   because only you can really know how you feel.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:42.200]   Sometimes it takes some effort to think into how you feel,
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.440]   to really get a clear sense of how you felt
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.780]   and how you feel, but only you can report that factually.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.160]   No one can dispute that, those are your feelings,
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.080]   and that's part of what you're writing about.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.200]   And then of course, there's the third component
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.940]   of what are the connections between different experiences
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.860]   that are coming to mind.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:03.260]   And there again, that is your unique factual report
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.980]   of what's going on inside your head around that event.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.960]   Okay, so what we're talking about here
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.920]   is an exercise in writing that yes is distressing,
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.060]   but that we know based on neuroimaging data,
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:20.560]   over time is increasing the baseline levels of activity
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.360]   in certain key areas of the prefrontal cortex.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.600]   And that we know is associated with improvements
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.500]   in the symptomology around trauma and other stressful events.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.520]   Now it's extremely important to highlight
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.040]   this truth telling component,
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.580]   and the fact that your truth about these experiences
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.080]   is indeed your truth.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.720]   And it's such a key component of the writing exercise.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.080]   So what we're looking at here is a situation where
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.040]   the event or events that happened actually happened,
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.620]   there's no changing that.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.860]   But your narrative about those events
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:53.040]   is vitally important in terms of how you experience
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.540]   either ongoing distress from or relief from those events.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.100]   And in sort of a counterintuitive way,
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.120]   reporting those events in a way that initially
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.200]   is very stressful, or that can be stressful
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.620]   in any number of those different four writing bouts,
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.580]   over time provides relief from that stress.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.640]   So why do I say counterintuitive?
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.180]   Well, you could say, okay, well then does distress itself
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.760]   cause changes in the prefrontal cortex that are positive?
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.220]   No, in fact, the opposite is true.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.120]   We know that being under conditions of duress or stress
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.960]   or trauma reduces activity in the prefrontal cortex.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.040]   And here we're saying recalling that trauma and stress
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.840]   in ways that are highly emotional and negative
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.640]   is actually increasing ongoing activity
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.280]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.400]   And indeed, yes, that is the case.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.760]   So how could that be?
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.360]   During development, neuroplasticity is a passive process.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.480]   Whatever we are exposed to changes our brain
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.560]   in a way that allows us
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.260]   to more reliably predict the future, right?
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.520]   That's one of the key functions of the brain.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.560]   But as an adult, meaning from age 25 onward,
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.340]   and really that's not a strict cutoff,
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.640]   could be late teens, maybe 19,
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.860]   all the way up to say age 120,
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.920]   which we think is perhaps the maximum lifespan
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.420]   that humans could possibly reach.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.040]   We don't know, most people don't reach 120,
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.580]   but let's say from 19 all the way up to 120,
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:17.200]   we know that neuroplasticity is created
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.920]   when the nervous system goes into states that are atypical
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.000]   as compared to our normal waking states.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.780]   And one of the key triggers for neuroplasticity
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.040]   is when we have high levels of the so-called catecholamines,
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.320]   dopamine, epinephrine, and/or norepinephrine
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.760]   in our brain and body.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.480]   That creates a state change
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.420]   that we call autonomic nervous system shift,
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.480]   where we have elevated heart rate, more distress,
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.960]   high degrees of emotionality.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.040]   It is highly uncomfortable often.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.140]   And yet that signals to the neural tissue,
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.040]   hey, something's happening here and we need to rewire,
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:50.920]   we need to change it.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.300]   And the actual rewiring occurs during deep sleep
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.100]   and states such as non-sleep deep rest,
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.900]   or anytime we're in a deep relaxation state.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.040]   Some of you have heard me talk about neuroplasticity before,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.120]   but the key elements to remember for today's discussion
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.100]   is that these states of heightened levels of emotionality
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.280]   are the trigger for neuroplasticity,
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   and that the actual rewiring of neural connections
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.340]   happens in sleep and states such as non-sleep deep rest.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.300]   So if we were to be completely logical,
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.440]   we would sit back at this point and say,
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:22.560]   okay, here's a protocol in which we deliberately
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.400]   make ourselves stressed out again
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.240]   about a very stressful or traumatic event.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.440]   And yet, even though that stressful or traumatic event
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.520]   at first created problems for our mental
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.180]   and physical health, by revisiting it
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:41.180]   and triggering that stressful experience again four times,
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.640]   in a lot of detail,
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.200]   somehow it's giving me relief from that experience.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.560]   It's creating positive mental and physical shifts.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.720]   I mean, how could that be?
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.440]   How could it be that the negative experience
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.940]   on the one hand creates problems,
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.820]   and then on the other hand,
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.560]   recreating that negative experience
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.600]   relieves those very same problems.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.040]   There's something completely illogical
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.920]   about that framework, right?
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.840]   Well, here's where things get really interesting.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.740]   There have been two separate collections of work
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.920]   in the psychology and neuroscience literature
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.320]   in the last 10 years,
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.860]   which have focused mainly on two concepts.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.340]   The first concept is that extremely stressful
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.560]   and traumatic experiences,
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.020]   because they induce a relative reduction
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.140]   in the activity in the prefrontal cortex,
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.580]   divorce our mind from creating
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.520]   a coherent structural narrative
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.140]   about what happened during those particular episodes.
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.800]   And in doing so,
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:37.640]   create a sort of confusion about responsibility.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.520]   Now, there's a whole discussion to be had about this,
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.840]   and we will have that discussion
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.320]   in a future episode of the podcast
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.560]   about how trauma is actually mapped
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.920]   within the brain and body.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.660]   There are a lot of theories about this, right?
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.040]   Sometimes we hear that it's all mapped within the body.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.720]   Sometimes we hear it's all mapped within the brain.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.080]   Turns out, as is almost always the case, it's both.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.560]   But there does seem to be both neuroscience-based
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.200]   and psychology,
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.860]   both clinical and research psychology-based evidence
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.480]   for the idea that when people experience
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.760]   very stressful and traumatic events,
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.400]   that the representation of those events
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.000]   is somewhat fractured in the sense that people,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.320]   by not talking about them,
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.680]   by not creating a coherent narrative around them,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.020]   start to form false correlations
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.120]   between the kind of stress that they create
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.760]   in our body and mind when we think about them,
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.400]   and a confusion about what happened,
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.360]   a confusion about why we feel terrible
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.780]   when maybe we weren't the perpetrator,
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:35.080]   or create a sort of lack of coherence
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.760]   between our bodily state and what we're thinking,
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.560]   especially because we're not the perpetrator, right?
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.600]   Here, we're talking about traumas
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.880]   and stressful things that happened to us.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.280]   Maybe we were participants in that
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.080]   by virtue of our circumstances,
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.320]   but when we talk about traumas,
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.600]   what we're really talking about are things
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.940]   that we would have never elected to do otherwise, okay?
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.100]   So I don't want to be too abstract about this,
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.440]   but again, within the neuroscience and psychology
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.520]   understanding of trauma and stress,
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.340]   it seems that there's a lack of coherence
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.300]   about the narrative.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.000]   There's also a mismatch between the bodily state
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.880]   and thoughts about that experience,
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.160]   and there seems to be a confusion about
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.880]   who or what was responsible for inducing that negative state
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.960]   in a way that in some sense causes people
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.760]   to set aside that narrative and try and push it away
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.320]   and not think about it, because it is confusing.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.560]   It can often even be discombobulating.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.400]   For those that have suffered
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.500]   from very stressful events and trauma,
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.480]   I think some of this will resonate with you.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.740]   Now, a separate literature that's largely nested
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.720]   just within the neuroscience community,
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.920]   although it's starting to wick out
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.200]   into the psychology community as well,
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.860]   is the idea that when people tell the truth,
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.660]   and in particular, when people tell the truth
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:47.680]   with a very coherent structured narrative,
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.160]   the levels of activity in the prefrontal cortex increase,
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.840]   but not just temporarily.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.640]   That is that there's neuroplasticity
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.600]   of these prefrontal cortical structures,
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.880]   which are both involved in generating coherent narratives,
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.680]   but are also involved, and this is super important,
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.360]   that are also involved in regulating the activity
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.920]   of those subcortical structures
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.560]   like the hypothalamus and limbic structures.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.800]   In other words, that when we can increase
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.740]   our understanding of an event,
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.920]   when we can understand why certain emotions arose,
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.440]   what our role in it really was,
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.140]   what others' roles in that particular event were,
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.000]   well, then by increasing the activity
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.520]   of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.580]   it's better both in that moment and going forward
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.960]   to regulate the activity
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.760]   of these other subcortical structures.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.580]   And I think one of the more impressive experiments
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.840]   within that whole field
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.880]   of linking prefrontal activity to truth-telling
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   is an experiment that was published a few years ago
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.680]   in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.880]   entitled "Increasing Honesty in Humans
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.420]   "with Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation."
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.600]   Now, this is a very artificial scenario
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.500]   where people come into the laboratory
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.720]   and they have people do
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.280]   what is essentially a die rolling game.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.320]   They roll dice.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.960]   Okay, so they're rolling dice,
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.620]   and then after they roll the dice,
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.100]   only they can see the score that they get with those dice.
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.260]   And then a number is presented on a screen,
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.540]   and they have to report whether or not
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:12.200]   the die roll that they did matches or does not match
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.880]   the number that's presented on the screen.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.720]   And if it does match, then they get a monetary award.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.060]   And the monetary award is not huge,
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.900]   but it's not insignificant either.
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.920]   For each die roll where they match the number
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.460]   that's presented on the screen,
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.380]   they get the equivalent of,
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.480]   and because this experiment was done in Switzerland,
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.760]   nine Swiss francs, which at the time of the study
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.680]   corresponded roughly to $9,
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.260]   and today corresponds to roughly $10.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.540]   So they do this repeatedly.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.900]   And so in some sense,
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.560]   the subjects in these experiments are in a place to make
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.860]   not an enormous amount of money,
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.200]   but again, not an insignificant amount either.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.620]   Now, here's the key component of the study.
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.980]   The statistics of the dice that they roll
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.240]   and the statistics of die rolling
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   and the numbers that they are presented,
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.680]   make sure that there can only be a correct match
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.060]   on average 50% of the time, okay?
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.180]   And in this experiment,
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:09.580]   the subjects are asked to report entirely
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:13.840]   on the honor system what they got when they rolled the dice.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.520]   And what one finds in this study
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.760]   and other studies that have been done subsequent to it
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.220]   is that when you take everyday people,
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.980]   so you take men and women, you take a broad age range,
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.760]   you're not selecting for sociopaths,
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:29.000]   you're not selecting for people in one given profession
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.620]   or another, pick your favorite profession
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.460]   if you were to assume any one given profession
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.480]   has less honest people than others,
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.940]   they collect people from all sorts of walks of life
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:42.520]   and people report getting the same number
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.600]   that is presented to them,
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.020]   that is a match about 68% of the time,
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:52.560]   which means they are not faithfully reporting what happened.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.760]   Now, neuroimaging studies show that when people lie,
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.320]   certain areas of the frontal cortex
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.960]   increase in their activity,
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.840]   although the major effect when one looks neurally
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.360]   is a reduction in the prefrontal cortex
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.740]   and in particular sub-compartments
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.120]   of the prefrontal cortex that we'll talk about in a moment.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.240]   And this particular study entitled
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.380]   Increasing Honesty in Humans
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.780]   with Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation,
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:19.120]   as the name suggests, used non-invasive brain stimulation,
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.480]   so this is transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.280]   which is a really nice and convenient tool
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.960]   because you don't have to drill down through the skull,
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.780]   you can simply put this tool, it's a little coil,
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.220]   you put it over a particular part of the brain,
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.420]   but on the outside of the skull,
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.340]   indeed on the outside of the hair,
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.000]   and you can either inhibit
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.580]   or stimulate particular brain areas
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.220]   using this transcranial stimulation.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.580]   I've actually had this done,
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.200]   not in this particular experiment,
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.960]   but I had it done when I was a graduate student
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.740]   some years ago, and it was placed over my motor cortex,
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.680]   and I was instructed to tap my fingers
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.720]   in a particular sequence,
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.320]   and then they inhibit neural activity
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   in a particular brain area,
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.000]   and I was unable to tap in that same sequence,
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.960]   and they could even shut down my ability to tap,
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.140]   it was terrifying, frankly,
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.440]   although I don't want to discourage anyone
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.360]   from participating in any of these experiments
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.460]   should you choose, and yes, of course,
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.760]   your motor abilities come back immediately afterwards,
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.340]   that's why they can run these experiments.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.040]   Now, in this experiment,
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.320]   what they did is they stimulated or inhibited neural activity
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.200]   in particular areas of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.520]   and what they discovered was,
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.000]   I think, and many others, by the way, also agree,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   a remarkable result, which is that when they stimulated
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.080]   over a particular region of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.760]   people's honest report of what happened
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.660]   when they rolled the die relative to the number
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.280]   they were presented increased, okay?
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.900]   So they went from reporting
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.020]   that they had matched the number on the screen,
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.880]   and therefore won money 68% of the time,
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.320]   that number was reduced down to what?
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.040]   Down to 50% of the time.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.400]   In other words, this stimulation of the prefrontal cortex
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.440]   took dishonest people,
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.520]   even though they were, should we say, mildly dishonest
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.520]   or dishonest only in certain conditions,
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.120]   they were getting into judgment calls,
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.220]   and I don't want to do that, and made them truly honest.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:08.580]   They faithfully represented reality
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:11.000]   when a particular area of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:11.920]   and that area, by the way,
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:16.720]   is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was activated,
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.320]   they became truly honest.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.160]   They faithfully represented what happened
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.720]   in the die rolling game.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.400]   Now, the conditions in this experiment
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.880]   are far and away different from the journaling protocol
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.560]   that we've talked about up until now.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.080]   However, there've been subsequent studies
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.420]   that have shown that indeed, when people tell the truth,
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.780]   to the best of their abilities,
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:41.000]   they are absolutely trying to faithfully report
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.020]   what happened in a given experience of theirs,
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:47.880]   activity in the prefrontal cortex goes up,
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.720]   and it persists afterwards.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.340]   There is indeed neuroplasticity of the prefrontal cortex.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.280]   So the hypothesis that seems to be the most likely,
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.120]   and indeed has the greatest weight of evidence for it,
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.480]   is that when people accurately and truthfully
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.520]   report an experience,
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.000]   even if that experience is a stressful and traumatic one,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.240]   the repeated activation of the prefrontal cortex
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.680]   that occurs during that truth telling,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.680]   even though the truth telling
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.160]   is about a highly negative experience,
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.520]   has the net effect over time of leading to more activity
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.760]   in the prefrontal cortex,
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.160]   and that has a sort of runaway positive effect
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:29.280]   in the sense that it creates a more coherent framework
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.960]   and understanding of the stressful thing that happened.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.320]   So all that discombobulation
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.400]   and that lack of coherent story
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.200]   that then leads to lack of coherence
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.880]   in terms of one's autonomic function,
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.640]   so underlying stress and confusion about who's responsible,
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.480]   that does seem to be resolved or at least partially resolved.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.500]   And the prefrontal cortex, of course,
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.980]   doesn't harbor one area just for faithful,
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:53.760]   accurate reporting of traumas and stressful events.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.200]   That very same area,
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.000]   that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.320]   is responsible for faithful reporting
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.080]   of all sorts of other things.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.560]   And there are now more and more studies showing
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.760]   that truth telling, faithful, accurate representation
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.080]   of what we at least experienced in our past
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.240]   and are experiencing presently,
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:16.360]   is good for us both in the short term and the long term.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.640]   And this, I believe, and other researchers,
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.220]   both neuroscientists and psychologists and psychiatrists
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:23.160]   that I've talked to about this result,
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.940]   are in agreement that when one sees
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.760]   all these positive shifts in, say, immune system function,
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.320]   like how could it be that these cells produced
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.300]   by the bone marrow and the thymus
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:37.120]   are somehow better able to deal with an infection
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.860]   when one has recounted a traumatic or stressful event, right?
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:41.040]   First of all, it's counterintuitive.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.380]   Second of all, why would that be?
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.400]   I mean, how are the body and brain linked in that way?
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.100]   Well, they're linked through this thing
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.540]   that we call the nervous system.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:50.960]   And the key component of the nervous system in this context
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.360]   is that when the prefrontal cortex can organize
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.180]   its understanding of why our autonomic nervous system
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:01.080]   was so active, well, then the autonomic nervous system,
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.280]   it seems, becomes less likely to be active
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.040]   when it's not supposed to, okay?
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.200]   That could at least partially explain
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:11.860]   the reductions in anxiety, the improvements in sleep,
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.640]   the reductions in insomnia,
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.800]   and because the nervous system and the immune system
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.280]   are in direct communication.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.760]   This often isn't discussed,
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.040]   but not only does the immune system impact the brain,
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.400]   but the brain has networks, literally neural circuits,
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.000]   that innervate structures like the spleen,
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.480]   like the thalamus, that can communicate
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.940]   with the bone marrow, right?
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.040]   This isn't science fiction.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.520]   This is really the case.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.980]   In fact, there was an article that just came out
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:36.640]   in the journal "Nature" this month,
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.800]   and I'll provide a link to it in the show, no captions,
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.200]   which is finally starting to acknowledge
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.040]   that yes, while these fields of immunology and brain science
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.580]   and psychology have existed as disparate silos up until now,
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.240]   it's oh so clear that the nervous system
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.200]   is the connection between all these different components
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.040]   of brain and body.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.800]   And so while it might seem counterintuitive
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.040]   that a writing protocol of the sort
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.220]   that we've been talking about today
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.960]   could positively impact the immune system,
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.680]   or that a writing protocol of the sort
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.140]   that we are talking about today
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:11.260]   could positively impact things like fibromyalgia symptoms,
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:13.200]   well, it makes perfect sense, really.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.580]   When we start to think about the prefrontal cortex
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:18.300]   as this highly flexible seat of our cognition,
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.320]   about our self-representation ideas about who we are,
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.600]   and about when certain elements within our brain and body
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.860]   ought to be activated,
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.260]   and when they ought not to be activated,
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:31.260]   because so much of the negative symptomology
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:35.740]   of stressful events and traumas is about the kind of disarray
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:38.760]   and discombobulated activation of wakefulness
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.820]   in the middle of sleep, right?
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.120]   Getting woken up in the middle of the night
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.460]   and not being able to go back to sleep,
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.480]   or elevated heart rate, panic attacks,
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.480]   anxiety, and on and on.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:47.320]   I talked about some of this
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.540]   in the Huberman Lab podcast episode that I did about stress
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.940]   and how to master stress with particular protocols.
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:55.180]   It also came up in the discussion with Dr. Paul Conte
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:58.120]   in the episode about trauma and the series on mental health.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.180]   So what we're pulling together here
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.120]   is a mechanistic understanding
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.900]   of why something like writing for 15 to 30 minutes
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.220]   about a stressful or traumatic episode
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:10.660]   would or even could induce all these positive shifts
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.180]   in mental and physical health.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.380]   And while we don't have a complete understanding
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:16.180]   about the underlying mechanisms,
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.660]   the activation and the neuroplasticity
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.140]   of the prefrontal cortex
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:23.340]   seems to be one of the most logical
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:26.220]   and the most likely that sits at the center
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:30.120]   of at least the top list of the most important mechanisms.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.580]   I want to be clear that yes, indeed,
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.700]   I'm saying that when you write about your truth,
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.360]   about the facts, the events of an experience,
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.240]   and your emotions, as they relate to that experience,
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.020]   and the connections that you draw
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.180]   between any number of different things
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.420]   around that experience,
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.260]   that the truth telling is the stimulus,
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.940]   and that the emotion that accompanies that truth telling
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:57.220]   is what allows for neuroplasticity to occur,
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.420]   and that indeed truth telling and heightened levels
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.540]   of emotion, even if they're negative emotions,
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:05.780]   really do seem to have a positive rehabilitative effect.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.860]   They're not necessarily going to cure every ailment.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.700]   I certainly don't want to give that impression,
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.260]   nor am I saying that people can't still benefit
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:15.360]   from therapy, talk therapy, or other forms of therapy,
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.420]   like prescription drug therapy, et cetera.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.860]   Those certainly have their place.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.460]   You should talk to an expert psychiatrist,
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.820]   psychologist, medical doctor, of course.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.500]   And in fact, the data on the sort of journaling
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.060]   that we talked about today
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.880]   indicate that people's progression through talk therapy,
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.300]   drug therapies, et cetera, for depression and PTSD
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.880]   is accelerated and significantly so
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.280]   when they do this type of journaling.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.360]   So the sort of journaling we're talking about today
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.720]   and other therapies are not mutually exclusive,
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.740]   and yet the journaling protocol
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.700]   that Pennebaker and colleagues came up with
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.220]   I think is spectacular
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.460]   because it has a number of important features,
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.680]   and some of those are perhaps obvious to you already.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.140]   First of all, it's completely zero cost.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.700]   I mean, it costs a bit of time, but not even that much time.
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:59.060]   It has an emotional cost, and we should acknowledge that.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.720]   It's intense, right?
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.100]   And the more intense it seems, the more effective.
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.320]   And third, it's something that really can be done
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:10.020]   either in the course of four days or across an entire month,
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.960]   so it has some degree of flexibility to it.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.480]   I would even say a great degree of flexibility to it.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.660]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:19.220]   it's been shown over and over again.
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.220]   I mean, more than 200 peer-reviewed studies,
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.740]   not just from Pennebaker, but from others as well,
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:27.740]   to have myriad positive effects on the body and the mind
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.580]   in ways that are not just short-term,
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.700]   but that are pervasive not just over months,
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.420]   but indeed over years.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:34.560]   So I don't know about you,
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.620]   but when I first learned about this literature,
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.180]   I was, well, initially a little bit skeptical
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.380]   because that's just my nature.
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.520]   I'm like, wait, how could journaling
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.860]   have such a huge impact?
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.680]   I mean, I've been journaling for years.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.980]   I know other people that journal on a regular basis,
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.020]   and I've never heard of this particular impact,
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.660]   and I certainly haven't heard or seen the data.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:57.300]   But when I started looking at the data,
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.340]   I thought, oh my goodness,
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.780]   how come I haven't heard about this?
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.580]   And I don't really have an answer for that.
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:05.380]   Although I will say that Pennebaker and others,
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:08.500]   I think were very early in their merging
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.420]   of mind and body states.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.220]   Although the initial studies weren't really focused
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:15.580]   on mind and body, all the emphasis on immune system
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:18.380]   and brain and neuroscience, that actually came later.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.900]   So I think one of the reasons we haven't heard
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:23.620]   about this particular form of journaling is that frankly,
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.860]   it's nested within the academic literature.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.680]   I haven't heard much about it being incorporated
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.780]   into clinical practices, although I am sure
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.620]   it is incorporated into clinical practices.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.180]   And frankly, whatever the reason,
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.140]   I'm just grateful to my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:38.460]   who again is our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:41.380]   He's a medical doctor of incredibly highly esteemed
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:44.220]   worldwide for his work on neuroplasticity
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:46.300]   and helping people with stress and anxiety
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:51.100]   and all sorts of other challenges for informing me about it.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.060]   So much so that I've decided that next month,
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:56.740]   I'm going to do one bout of writing
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.480]   for each week within that month.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:01.500]   I've opted to not do the four consecutive days of writing.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.620]   To me, just personally, that seems a bit too intense.
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.140]   It's not the time commitment.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:09.060]   It's the emotional commitment of placing myself
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.340]   into close proximity of some really challenging,
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:15.560]   stressful, maybe even traumatic memories,
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.420]   day after day after day for four days.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.660]   Personally, I don't want to do that.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.640]   Other people might opt to do that in tighter succession
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.860]   and do the four days in a row.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.180]   What the literature tells us again
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.460]   is that it doesn't really matter.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.080]   As long as you do the four bouts of writing,
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.360]   sometime within a month period,
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.840]   doesn't matter if they all are back-to-back days
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.120]   or you spread them out by a week or so.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.120]   Just to recap the other components of the protocol,
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.560]   you're going to write about the same event
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.500]   for all four writing episodes.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.960]   Those writing episodes can be anywhere
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.300]   from 15 to 30 minutes, but not less.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.240]   Throughout each writing episode,
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.240]   you're going to continuously write, right?
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.800]   Unless you need to stop to catch your breath
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.780]   or wipe your eyes dry of tears,
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:00.260]   you're going to keep writing.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:03.860]   It is not necessary to pay attention to grammar or spelling,
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:05.440]   but some degree of coherence,
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.360]   maybe not perfect complete sentences,
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.900]   but some degree of coherence is probably useful,
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:11.280]   especially if you decide to go back
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.780]   and analyze what you wrote later,
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.000]   which again is an option.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   You don't have to do that.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:16.920]   But if you do want to do that,
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:20.820]   you're going to go back and circle the negative words,
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.860]   that is the words that you perceive to be negative,
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.260]   and you're going to square the words that are positive.
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.600]   And if you like, you can also reread them
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.320]   and see whether or not,
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.920]   as was observed in the studies that we described,
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.960]   there was an increase in the amount of coherence
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.680]   about the topic or the event that you wrote about.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:41.480]   Keep in mind that for each of the four ballots of writing,
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.960]   you want to include both facts about the events,
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.840]   facts about how you felt and or feel about those events now,
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.180]   and third, any associations whatsoever
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:55.140]   that happen to come to mind about those events,
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:57.080]   emotional states, people in your life,
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:58.860]   anything past, present, or future.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:00.400]   That third category of things to include
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.980]   is really open to you for anything you want to include.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.800]   The only requirement for it to be included
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.360]   is that it's true for you.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.440]   Keep in mind also that this writing protocol is for you.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.940]   It is not necessarily to be shared.
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:15.380]   Now, there isn't a rule that says that you cannot share it
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.320]   with anybody.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.980]   Although I do want to introduce the important caveat
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.820]   that if you are going to share it with someone,
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:24.960]   that person should be a dedicated healthcare,
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.620]   ideally mental healthcare professional,
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.320]   because there are data that suggest
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:32.740]   that when we write about traumatic and stressful events,
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.160]   while it can be very beneficial for us,
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.300]   it can actually be traumatic or challenging for people
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:39.740]   that we read it to.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.600]   Now, there's huge variation around that statement.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.480]   Certainly many of you probably know friends
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.740]   or family members or other trusted ones
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:48.140]   that you can talk to that would be able to hear
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.020]   about your stressful or traumatic experience
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.040]   and not be traumatized by it.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.780]   However, it does seem that the listener
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:57.560]   can experience trauma and negative symptoms,
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.300]   which is challenges, sleeping, distress, et cetera,
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.360]   by hearing about very stressful events
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.680]   that have occurred to others.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.680]   Okay, this is third-hand trauma or observational trauma,
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.000]   it's sometimes called.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.240]   So if we were to adhere to the protocol
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.560]   as it was used in the various studies
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.440]   that form the basis for what we're talking about today,
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.240]   we would say that you are writing about something
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.480]   that is for your eyes only.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.440]   In fact, you are welcome to tear up
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.600]   or delete the document afterwards.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.160]   And certainly you would want to store it in a safe place
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.720]   so that it's not going to fall into hands of somebody
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:33.660]   that you wouldn't want seeing the contents of that writing.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:34.720]   The other thing to keep in mind
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.160]   is that while it's been demonstrated over and over again,
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.500]   that over time, these bouts of writing
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.900]   lead to improvements in mental and physical health.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.260]   As we talked about earlier, it is very normal,
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:46.960]   and in fact, quite likely,
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.960]   that one will feel pretty activated in the negative sense,
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:55.420]   that one will feel somewhat low, depressed, angry, sad,
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:58.300]   immediately after finishing one of these bouts of writing,
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:01.420]   especially if you fall into the high expressor category.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:03.460]   So it's important that, as we mentioned earlier,
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.140]   that you have a buffer of time
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:06.340]   after which you complete the writing
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:08.740]   before moving into your other day's events.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.580]   I also just personally wouldn't recommend
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.400]   that you do this writing exercise
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.840]   just prior to trying to go to sleep at night
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:17.860]   if the experience is especially stressful or traumatic,
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.440]   and by definition, the writing exercise
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.220]   focuses on stressful and traumatic events.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:23.740]   So keep that in mind as well.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:27.540]   And then as a final point, but certainly a significant one,
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:30.240]   is to keep in mind that if this writing protocol
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:34.480]   is creating in you significant enough amounts of stress,
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.380]   either psychological or physical,
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.320]   that you simply don't want to do it
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.500]   or that it's impeding other areas of life,
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.900]   by all means, just stop, okay?
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:46.320]   There was very little, if any, data within the papers
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.700]   that I read that indicated that people
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:51.280]   had to be removed from the study for this reason,
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.340]   but keep in mind that we're talking about
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:56.880]   purposefully delving into stressful or traumatic experiences
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.620]   and writing about them in some detail
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:33:59.900]   so it stands to reason
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.020]   that some people might not be able to tolerate that.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:03.980]   And I want to strongly request that
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:07.080]   before anyone embark on this writing protocol,
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.040]   that you ask yourself whether or not
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.760]   you are indeed prepared to deal with the emotional state
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:16.740]   that might accompany faithful, accurate recollection
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:19.140]   of what happened, what you felt,
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:21.020]   and any links or experiences
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.300]   a full four times across the protocol.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:26.220]   I also see no reason why you couldn't do this protocol
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:28.680]   for something that wasn't the most stressful
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.300]   or traumatic event in your life,
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.940]   but rather take your first pass at this protocol
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:36.260]   with something that was very stressful,
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.320]   maybe even traumatic,
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.480]   but perhaps not the most traumatic event
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.320]   as a way of sampling whether or not it's for you.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.780]   In fact, I plan to do that.
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.360]   In reviewing the literature
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.860]   and preparing for today's episode,
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:48.940]   I wrote down two things, possibly three,
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.740]   that I would want to write about,
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:52.860]   and then I rated them one through three,
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:55.940]   one being the most stressful, perhaps even traumatic,
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.420]   the other being less stressful,
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:59.580]   and the third, the least stressful of the three,
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.740]   and decided to go with writing about
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:03.380]   the second in that list,
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.740]   that is the moderately stressful AK traumatic event
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.680]   as a way to first wade into this protocol.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.740]   But I will adhere to the protocol.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.960]   I'm going to write about that same thing four times
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:16.580]   as opposed to switching from one event to the next
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:17.680]   midway through the protocol.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.040]   So I am going to adhere to the protocol.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:21.700]   I'll certainly be happy to get back to you
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:23.180]   and let you know how it goes.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:25.260]   I invite you, if you like,
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:27.900]   to embrace this protocol, to try it.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.700]   We've provided links to the literature
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.260]   that supports this protocol.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.920]   Again, it's very rare.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.540]   Perhaps the first time that I've ever done
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.820]   an entire podcast episode about a single protocol
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.960]   or to formulate an entire podcast around a protocol.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.380]   But frankly, I don't look at this protocol
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.700]   from Pennebaker and Collies as just a protocol.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:48.180]   I look at it as an entire body of literature
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:50.800]   that includes a center of massive data
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.180]   that all seem to point in the same direction,
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:56.220]   which is that writing about something very stressful
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:58.680]   or traumatic for 15 to 30 minutes,
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.820]   four times, either on consecutive days
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:03.160]   or separated out by a week between each of those
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.020]   four writing sessions can produce long lasting
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.540]   positive effects on mental and physical health.
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.140]   And to me, that's a protocol that is simply too valuable
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:15.920]   to overlook and simply too valuable to not share with you.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.140]   If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,

[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.040]   I do read all the comments.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.160]   Not on today's episode,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.680]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.900]   we discussed supplements.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:52.000]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.320]   for things like improving sleep, for hormone support,
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.760]   and for improving focus.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.320]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:00.760]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.600]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.320]   So it's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.600]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.480]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:14.120]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.960]   LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.140]   And on all of those platforms,
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.300]   I discuss science and science related tools,
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.740]   some of which overlap with the contents
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:21.880]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.920]   but much of which are distinct from the contents
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.120]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.360]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.480]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.880]   to our neural network newsletter,
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.080]   the neural network newsletter is a monthly newsletter
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.480]   that's completely zero cost,
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.560]   that includes podcast summaries, as well as toolkits.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.000]   Toolkits are brief PDFs that describe protocols
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.360]   for things like neuroplasticity, for improving your sleep,
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:46.400]   for dopamine regulation, for exercise flexibility,
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.240]   and on and on.
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.600]   Again, all completely zero cost.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.080]   To sign up for the neural network newsletter,
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:53.240]   you simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu tab,
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:55.640]   scroll down to newsletter, and put your email there.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.160]   You'll receive an email, and if you approve,
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.200]   you'll start receiving the monthly newsletter.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.640]   Again, it's completely zero cost,
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.040]   and I want to point out that we do not
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.920]   share your email with anybody.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.440]   Thank you for joining for today's episode,
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.760]   where we discussed a journaling protocol
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.800]   that has been demonstrated in the scientific literature
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.760]   to significantly improve mental and physical health.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.020]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:16.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:21.960]   (upbeat music)
