[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   [Music]
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.700]   Moving on with questions about the deep life, our first one comes from Loves Deep Work.
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.700]   Good name.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.700]   This question is, "What are your thoughts on fasting and deep work?"
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.000]   Well, I will say I do this accidentally quite a bit,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   as my wife will tell you and complain about.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.900]   Sometimes when I'm really locked in on a deadline,
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900]   I will just work all day and not eat.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.200]   And I'll be honest, it doesn't seem to affect my work though.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.700]   It does make me a real annoying person to be around afterwards.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.000]   That's why she does not like that.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.500]   My producer, Jesse, though, knows more about fasting.
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.400]   Jesse, do I have this right?
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400]   You don't eat, what, lunch or you don't eat breakfast?
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.900]   You have some fasting thing going on.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.000]   You probably know more about this.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.600]   I eat basically just dinner every day.
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.600]   But I started, I discovered it through Tim Ferriss' podcast
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.100]   when he was interviewing Terry Crews.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.800]   Terry, I saw a picture of him, he looked jacked anyway.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.300]   And he's like, yeah, Ferriss asked him if he could do one thing.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000]   You know, he's 50-something at the time.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.400]   What would he do?
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800]   He goes, "I would have fasted earlier."
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.100]   And I was like, immediately started doing that.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.500]   But I started an eight-hour period.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.400]   I did that for like a year.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.800]   Then I just narrowed it even more.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.200]   So now I just eat dinner.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.400]   So what do you get out of that?
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.500]   What was Terry Crews pitching?
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.400]   If you do it, you get cut.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.600]   Oh, interesting.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.000]   Like, because you're, it all comes down to calories in and calories out.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.100]   So, I mean, I wanted to get more cut and I work out a lot anyway.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.800]   And it was amazing.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.600]   It was like, I immediately, well, not immediately, but over time,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.900]   like, I got a lot more cut, more cut than I've ever been.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.200]   And I've been doing this now for like four or five years.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.800]   So, by the way, those are all phrases you would never hear at a computer
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.600]   science faculty meeting.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.100]   I wanted to get more cut.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.000]   I mean, I'm working out a lot anyways.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200]   These are all, these are all phrases you want to hear.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.600]   But what about your concentration ability?
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Do you get hungry?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.000]   Do you get, do you find that you're not able to think as clearly?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.900]   Do you get the opposite?
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.200]   When it comes to this question about deep work, what do you think the impact
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.500]   would be?
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.600]   I think you actually think more clearly.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.700]   Are you hungry?
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.400]   Do you get hungry?
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Yeah, I definitely get hungry, but every day is kind of like a battle.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.100]   So like every day you kind of just get through it and eventually you get
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.700]   to the evening and you can eat and it's, you know, and the other thing
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700]   about it too, is you can't really gorge at night either.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.100]   You still got to eat healthy if you, especially as you get older and
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.500]   stuff.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   So that's one thing I realized.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.300]   And, but the healthy food, just the nature of that food also probably
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.400]   just regulates what you can eat, right?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.500]   Because if you're eating vegetables or whatever, there's only so much
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.000]   you can eat.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.100]   Whereas if it was like a bag of tortilla chips, you could probably
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.800]   crush three of those.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.600]   Yeah, you can't eat any processed foods for the most part, unless you're
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.200]   cheating.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.800]   I was just reading, I just revisited Tom Brady's TB12 like book where he
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.600]   has like a nutrition chapter in there.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   And it's, it's simple stuff.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.700]   He doesn't do anything that crazy.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.900]   He just eats healthy foods and you, you have to do that most of the time.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.600]   But in terms of thinking and doing work, I think it really helps.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.200]   And plus it doesn't, it limits the cognitive strain of having to buy a lot
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   of stuff and think about getting food all the time and stuff like that.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.600]   All right.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.400]   So it sounds like maybe if this listener wants to experiment, experiment,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.300]   start with the eight hour.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.400]   So skip breakfast or something.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.400]   I've had a lot of buddies cause I've been doing it for a while and some of
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.100]   them do like eight and eight and a half hours, which I did for a year.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.300]   And then I, I was like, I think I can crank this up even more because
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.400]   sometimes, you know, in the evenings and stuff, I'll, you know, I want to
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.600]   still be able to like have beer and stuff every once in a while.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.500]   So like I wanted to have more flexibility.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.600]   So then I was just like, let me experiment with narrowing the number.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.400]   And then it just became basically like an hour and a half to two hour,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.100]   pretty narrow window.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.400]   All right.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.500]   So I think we now have a bestseller here.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.400]   Here's the diet, only beer for eight hours.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.800]   And then you go to food for the four hours that, that remains.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.100]   The one thing I have heard, I've tried this before informally.
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.100]   I might try this more.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:28.200]   I do know a couple buddies who swear by, they do like Laird Hamilton's
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.100]   coffee creamer or something like this, like a coconut oil, like a healthy
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.100]   fat in their coffee for breakfast and no other food.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.900]   And they swear by that really giving them mental clarity, you know, so
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.500]   it's like the caffeine, I guess there's a couple things that goes on.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.500]   One, the, the, the fats they use in these sort of high fat creamers,
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.800]   um, slows down potentially the spread of the caffeine.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   So it spreads it out.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.400]   And I don't know if there's a ketone situation or just an energy situation,
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.300]   but I do know people who swear by that, that they, um, do one of these.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.800]   I don't know what you call them.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.100]   Clean fat coffee creamers.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.700]   And the one I've tried is Laird Hamilton's.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.100]   I've tried that too.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.800]   I like it.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.900]   Most of the time I try to drink my coffee black, but three times a week,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.900]   I give myself the flexibility to have some cream.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.100]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.300]   So that's something you could try.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.300]   Um, maybe the, what's his name?
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.800]   Dave Asprey has something to the Bulletproof guy.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.300]   They have some other, but it's all the same thing.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.000]   It's like coconut fat style MCT oil.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Um, you know, you give that a try and then just wait till at least lunch.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.300]   Um, the only thing I know for sure is true is that high carb or processed
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.100]   food crashes, you're thinking.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.800]   A hundred percent.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.700]   I mean, the food marketing industry is like, does one of the best marketing
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.500]   campaigns of all time, convincing us that we need to eat, go to any grocery
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.000]   store and you can see aisles and aisles stuff that you should just avoid.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.900]   So, I mean, if you're, if you're eating, you know, a burger and fries
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.900]   for lunch, you're not, you're not deep thinking that afternoon.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.300]   [Music]
