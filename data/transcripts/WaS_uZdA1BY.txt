[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   So what I would like to do is I would like to talk about how I've been applying so good
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.200]   they can't ignore you since I read it like a long time ago, actually.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920]   But then I feel like I kind of messed up somewhere along the way.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   So after after I kind of summarize, I would like us to go into kind of like, where did I go wrong and where do I go from here?
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.260]   Sounds good.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:28.120]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   Episode 220.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:42.600]   So if you're new to the program, it is where I answer questions from my audience about the theory and practice of working and living deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.640]   We're recording today on Halloween, which I think is exciting.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.000]   Jesse thought it'd be a good idea, producer Jesse, to wear a costume, which I which I encouraged.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.760]   I think he went a little bit too far, though.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.240]   I'll let you be the judge.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:07.200]   If you're if you're listening, you'll have to go look for the episode 220 video at YouTube.com/CalNewportMedia to participate here.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.000]   But you be the judge.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760]   I think Jesse went a little bit too far here.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.920]   So I really got into the costume.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.840]   So what do you think about that?
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.040]   I mean, it's pretty elaborate, Jesse.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.400]   Well, what is a skeleton's favorite plant?
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.200]   I don't know what.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.880]   A bonsai.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:41.360]   I mean, I think I have to fire you at this point.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.920]   I think that's clear.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.160]   All right, fair enough.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.040]   Oh, my. All right.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.800]   Enough nonsense.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.880]   Actually, I take it back.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.720]   If you're listening, don't go to YouTube to watch this.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.280]   This will be a waste of everyone's time.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.720]   All right, well, we get the the real producer, Jesse, back into his seat.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.880]   I got a couple of announcements to make.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.680]   Look, we can even look what he look what I've read for Jesse.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.560]   I have on camera now.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.200]   Oh, my. I'll tell you, Jesse, before I do the announcements,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.840]   this felt like a good idea when I was walking out of my house.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.480]   As I got to the HQ, I began to have doubts.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   Right next to our office in the HQ is a legitimate documentary
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.840]   video production company, right?
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.400]   And we're talking about a company that does serious issue based documentaries.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.160]   Now they know who I am, like they know my books, but I think they're
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.000]   they're confused why I have an office.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.560]   And in their minds, it's probably some sort of weird,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.080]   you know, grown man's clubhouse.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.400]   And I just was having this thought as I was walking down the street
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.680]   carrying a fluorescent skeleton.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.840]   That if they see me right now, I'm not going to be disabusing them
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.280]   of their impression of what's going on in here.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.720]   So fortunately I did avoid them, avoided our super, did run into my
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.160]   neighbor carrying the skeleton, but yeah, could be worse.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.280]   For those not watching, it's good to know that the skeleton
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.880]   is, you know, probably five feet tall.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.840]   It is a short.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.960]   It's a, we take it seriously.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.640]   We take it seriously.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.880]   Our, our Halloween decorations have a lot of skeletons in them.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.440]   So we got a good show.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.200]   So there's, there's two blocks of questions coming up early in the first block.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.800]   We have our very first live caller.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.040]   Jesse had promised us by the end of October, this episode has been
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.560]   recorded on the last day of October.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.200]   So that's exciting.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.840]   So we'll actually have me talking live with a caller going back
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.200]   and forth about their issue.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.680]   Also have a good deep dive.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.280]   I want to get into before we get into all that, a couple of quick announcements.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.600]   First, I want to mention the live event.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.480]   Come see Jesse and I live Monday, November 14th at 7:00 PM at the East
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.280]   City Bookshop here in Washington, DC.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.360]   That's on Capitol Hill.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.280]   There is a book of it.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.040]   My friend David Sacks has a new book out called The Future is Analog, and I'll
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.480]   be moderating a conversation with him.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.760]   So sort of like me interviewing David, but I haven't really done or been to an
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.840]   event just for my readers and listeners since pre pandemic.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.440]   So if you're in the DC area, come by November 14th, 7 PM East City Bookshop.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.400]   Other reminder, submit your questions.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.320]   There's a link right in the show notes to do so.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.960]   You go right to a survey, you fill in the questions.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.360]   If you're interested in doing the question live, you can also put
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.200]   your email address there at the end.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.400]   While we're still early in this new survey, it's your best chance
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.680]   to get your question on a show.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.600]   So definitely go submit your questions.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.160]   All right.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.200]   Well, that's our news for now.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.680]   Uh, let's get rolling right away with today's deep dive.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.840]   I'm calling it the two types of ambition.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.120]   Now this deep dive is based off of a, an article I posted to my newsletter
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.280]   at calnewport.com just a few days ago.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.880]   So the original title of the article, and I have it on my screen here for those
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.400]   who are watching, instead of just listening, the original title of the
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.600]   article was on Michael Crichton's busy ambition.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.200]   It's from October 28th.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   So the motivation for this article, which I want to pick apart in our deep dive
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.360]   today was actually coming across a profile of Crichton in the New York
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.480]   Times archives from 1970.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.200]   And I have this on the page now on the screen, if you're watching a profile
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.360]   that's titled for Michael Crichton medicine is for writing.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.680]   There's also a picture of a young Michael Crichton there.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.240]   So what struck me when I read this profile recently was the busyness of
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.280]   Michael Crichton at this very early stage of his career.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.520]   So let me set the scene for you.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.440]   This is the scene that I, I opened the article with.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.920]   All right.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.480]   It's Michael Crichton, his last year at Harvard medical school.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.040]   He's 26 years old.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.720]   He goes to the Dean of the medical school.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.280]   Uh, and he says, I don't think I'm going to practice medicine.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.200]   I figured this out.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.400]   But what I do want to do is publish a nonfiction book about hospital life in a
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   particular, uh, the hospital in Boston where he was doing his, uh, intern rounds.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.120]   And he's, and, and he asked, can I, instead of doing some of the normal,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.360]   whatever, uh, work you would do during your final semester, can I instead go
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.520]   around the hospital and gather research for my book?
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.720]   And here's the actual quote I have here.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.640]   From this article, which was written one year after this occurred, he said, why
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.680]   should I spend the last half of my last year at medical school learning to read
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.120]   electrocardiograms when I never intended to practice?
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.840]   All right.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.200]   So he says this, the Dean of Harvard medical school, the Dean
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.920]   replies, paternalistically, Michael.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.200]   I don't think you realize how hard it is to write a book.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.160]   Right.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.000]   So he's trying to warn this young kid, like you can't just like go walk around
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.120]   the hospital and gather some notes.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.040]   This is when Crichton did his mic drop and revealed to the Dean of Harvard
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   medical school that he had already published four books during his
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.360]   first three years at medical school.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.960]   He had been doing so under the pen name, John Lang, L A N G E.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.680]   Not only had he written those four books, but he had multiple other projects in
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.080]   action, not just this nonfiction book idea, which he had already started by the
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.720]   way, but his first two, I would say serious publication efforts, his first
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.920]   four books are potboilers.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.360]   I've read them.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.920]   You can buy them.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.720]   They reissued them under Michael Crichton's original name.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.800]   They're Clive Kustler, James Bond style thrillers with
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.400]   some techno flavor added in.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.880]   But he was also by this final year of his med school deep underway
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.360]   with some more serious books.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.840]   The first being a case of need, which he published under a pseudonym as well, but
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.960]   it was really the first thriller he wrote that got medicine more deeply involved.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.800]   This would win that next year.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.120]   It would win an Edgar award for best mystery novel of the year.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.680]   It's a hard award to win.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.960]   He also was working on the Adronima strain first book he would publish under his own
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.280]   name and of course would be a big breakout bestseller.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.800]   It's what really started his fame in the literary world, became
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.880]   a big movie back in the seventies.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.240]   He had all this stuff already going on when he went to talk to the med school dean.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.560]   So by the time you get to a year later, when this New York times profile is
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.000]   written, you see that this is a one man multimedia operation.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.160]   So in addition to all of those projects going on, he somehow has two more.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.600]   Pot boilers he writes under his pseudonym by 1970.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.800]   So somehow he adds two more books unrelated to a case of need,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.120]   unrelated to the Adronima stream.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.000]   He also, by this point was working on what would become the terminal man.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.080]   His second techno thriller written under his own name.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.200]   It was called something different in the profile.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.680]   They're still calling it a sympathetic man, like a sympathetic nervous system,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.600]   but terminal man is much better.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.520]   He revealed that he was already intent on directing the movie for the terminal man.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.160]   So he was concurrently writing a screenplay.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.120]   He was also traveling to Hollywood every week on what he called, and I'm
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.280]   highlighting this here, a skills building gambit.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.320]   So he was going to Hollywood to be trying to pick up because
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.680]   he wanted to be a director as well.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.920]   And so he was going to Hollywood a couple of days a week.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.160]   So this was the year after he left medical school.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.120]   So he, he had this sort of half-hearted postdoc at the
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.760]   Salk Institute in La Jolla, uh, La Jolla, Lajolla, J O L L A.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.520]   Coya.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:44.880]   Coya.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.400]   Is it La Jolla?
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:45.800]   Okay.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.560]   Which is not far from LA, I guess.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.800]   So he was going back and forth community.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.560]   San Diego area.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:50.800]   Yep.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.960]   All this stuff was going on.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.720]   At 27 years old, all this was going on at the same time.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.480]   The New York times profile called his career hyperactive.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.240]   And it is, can you imagine that?
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.160]   I mean, I do a fair amount of things.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.840]   That's crazy.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.320]   The amount of things he had going on.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.560]   So all these different projects he was juggling at the same time.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.160]   Oh, and by the way, he also published a novel with his brother.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.520]   Under a pseudonym between 1969 and 70 as well, an experimental novel
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.440]   about drug dealing, where they would pass the manuscript back and forth.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.920]   And, uh, he would write an entire draft and then his brother
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.600]   would edit entire draft, all this stuff's going on.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   So busy guy.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.920]   I compared him in this article, let's say apples to apples, another
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.880]   really successful fiction writer, John Grisham, John Grisham's younger.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.280]   Um, he, he really got a start in the early nineties, whereas, uh, we have
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.880]   Crichton getting a start in the early seventies, but whatever, same idea.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.200]   And there was a period in the nineties where they were competing back and
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.160]   forth, not just for the biggest book sales Grisham and Crichton for a
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.520]   period of the nineties, there were in a huge war on movie rights.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   They were breaking deals, uh, breaking records for movie deals.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.000]   And their agents would say things like, I want whatever Crichton got
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.600]   for his last book, plus $1.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.920]   Like they were trying to one up each other.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.640]   All right.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.800]   So what's John Grisham story.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   So John Grisham in the 1980s, uh, is a lawyer, small town, Mississippi lawyer.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.920]   He runs for, and also wins a seat in the Mississippi state legislature.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.640]   So he's a Democrat state legislature and a small town lawyer
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.000]   doing both of those things.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.240]   State legislators, a part-time job.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.520]   And he decides he wants to write a book.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.400]   He gets an idea for a book from a case that he wasn't trying, but was observing.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.240]   And he gets this idea for a book and he tells his wife, I want to
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.360]   try to write a legal thriller.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.080]   And she said, okay, but do two in a row.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.440]   Right.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.360]   So that way, you know, maybe one of the ideas doesn't work.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.400]   You have two shots at it right away.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.240]   And if both of those ideas don't work, then you know that
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.200]   maybe that's not for you.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.240]   So he does this, uh, it's hard.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.960]   It takes him longer than it takes Crichton.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.160]   I have the numbers in here, but I think it was something like three years.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.880]   Because he's writing in between these two jobs and you can find them in some
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.600]   interviews talking about, oh, I have my notepad while I was waiting for meetings.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.440]   I was waiting for a legislative session to begin at scribble notes, but, but I
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.320]   found a really definitive interview where he said, this is the secret.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.640]   I woke up at five and I wrote every morning and it was really hard
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.800]   and I was often really tired and it wasn't like all that fun.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.280]   And that was the only way to really make progress.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.240]   And it still took him three years to write the first book.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.080]   He started the second book the day after he finished the first.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   Good thing he did that because the first name, the, the, uh,
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.560]   the first book of time to kill.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.680]   He had a hard time finding a publisher when it came out, small first
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.080]   printing did nothing disappeared, but he had already basically finished
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.360]   his second book by that point.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.840]   So he's like, I might as well.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:51.720]   This time, his second book, which is the firm, his agent leaked bootleg
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.880]   copies of the manuscript to movie producers.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.800]   So before they had even sold the book, Paramount came in and said, we'll pay
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.880]   you $600,000 for the movie rights for the firm.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.720]   So then once the publishing industry heard that Paramount had paid 600,000,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   they're going to do a big movie, which they eventually did with
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.000]   Gene Hackman and Tom Cruise.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.160]   Double day snapped up the book rights for a lot of money.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.000]   That book got a lot of coverage, went on to sell a lot.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.480]   The number I quote in the article, 7 million copies.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.280]   I couldn't really source that well.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.480]   It might be less than that, but anyways, it's sold.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.360]   It's sold a lot of copies instead of his whole career.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:32.520]   This is where, and I say in the article, Grisham's path diverges from Crichton.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:41.080]   Grisham does not look at the buffet of appealing opportunities that is generated
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.920]   by his initial success and say, let's start feasting.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.400]   He does something very different.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.080]   He says, I now have the leverage and money needed to simplify my
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.600]   life in a way I couldn't before.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.680]   Stops practicing law, leaves the legislature.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.320]   Based on the advice he heard from a bookseller that all the big fiction
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.480]   names published once a year, he said, that's what I'm going to do.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.600]   One book a year.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.840]   That's what matters, especially in the beginning.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.120]   I need a book every year to solidify my audience.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.520]   And he basically retreated into just a writing routine of one book per year.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.800]   And I have some of the details of it because he's talked about this before.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.480]   Here's how he eventually perfected this.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.240]   I would call it almost monastic writing routine.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.600]   He starts writing on January 1st.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.720]   He works three hours a day, five days a week.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.520]   He used to write in their Oxford.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.680]   Then he moved to Charlottesville, Virginia.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.520]   They have a farm.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.800]   He has an outbuilding on that farm that they renovated for him
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.280]   to write no internet connection there.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.640]   First thing in the day, three hours.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.880]   He basically writes till lunchtime, five days a week, not on the weekends.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.000]   All right.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.680]   That rhythm has him finish the first draft usually by March.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.840]   The editing begins.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.280]   He wants to have the manuscript completely locked in by July.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.600]   Starts in January, six months later, done with the manuscript.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.120]   Now that's it for writing until the next January.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.240]   Now he'll think and do research about what his next book
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.720]   is going to do at his own pace.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.200]   He will do clearly publicity.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.440]   He usually does fall releases.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.080]   So when that book comes out in the fall, he'll do publicity,
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.760]   but he's not a big publicity guy.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.720]   He does limited tours.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.400]   He'll do the big shows and interviews and then retreats again back to his farm.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.480]   And that's kind of it.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.720]   He doesn't do these other projects.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.800]   He doesn't want to direct.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.040]   He doesn't want to do 17 different types of books like Crichton was doing.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.800]   He wasn't trying to establish a production company or
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.320]   get involved in television.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.880]   They would sell the movie rights to his books, but that was about it.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.480]   15 hours a week, six months out of the year.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.880]   Uh, the rest of his energy goes to other things.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.400]   When he had younger kids, they were really, he was really
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   into little league baseball.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.560]   And so he built, uh, it's not, he doesn't want, it's not officially
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.960]   associated with little league, but a youth baseball, uh, complex
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.720]   five, really great fields.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.680]   They started their own youth baseball league.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.280]   He was the commissioner of the league.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.120]   He loves baseball.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.800]   He loves coaching.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.520]   He thinks it's great.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.840]   You know, for kids, I know he's heavily involved in
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.480]   political fundraising as well.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.520]   It just has other stuff that he does.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.480]   So I found an article and I can't, I can't excavate this anymore, but I
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.160]   remember finding this and reading this and I wrote about this somewhere.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.640]   I can't find where, so I can't find the original source, but you'll have
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.440]   to take me, take me at my word for this.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.720]   Uh, at some point, this was an article from probably the last 10 or 15 years.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.880]   His longtime assistant retired.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.040]   And he realized, according to this article, I found that he didn't
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.360]   need to hire a replacement because there was no work for her to do.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.480]   I mean, his agent has his number.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.120]   His editor has his number.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.720]   They know his routine.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.400]   He's not involved in a lot of projects.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.960]   He's not involved in a lot of schemes.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.560]   So there was nothing for the assistant to even organize.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.400]   He writes from January to March edits from March to July does a one
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.880]   week publicity tour in the fall.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.840]   So it was very different than Crichton.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.160]   Crichton says, I now have success.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.040]   I want to go do lots of different things.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.880]   Grisham says I have success.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.040]   I want to simplify my life.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.840]   So what I did in this piece and what I want to do right here is try to put names
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.240]   to these two different approaches to ambition.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.160]   So what I write in the article is the first model exemplified by
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.800]   Crichton is what I call type one.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.160]   It craves activities and feasts at the buffet of appealing
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.040]   opportunities that success creates.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.680]   The other model exemplified by Grisham is what I call type two.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.520]   It craves simplicity and autonomy and see success as a source of leverage
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.040]   to reduce stressful obligations.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.080]   Medical school wasn't sufficiently stimulating for Crichton.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.840]   Life as a lawyer was too hectic for Grisham.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.560]   They therefore reacted to their success in much different ways
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.760]   when it respectively arrived.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.000]   Now, my argument is this is a spectrum, but most people fall towards one end of
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.880]   the spectrum or the other, the type one Crichton end or the type two Grisham end.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.360]   And that it's important to understand where you fall on the spectrum because
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.800]   it will have a big impact on not only do you, how you plan your professional
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.280]   or aspirational endeavors, but how you react to successes when they come.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.800]   If you don't have this figured out, you can end up in a mismatch situation.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.240]   If you're a Grisham that allows the pressure of your success to push you
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.360]   into a bunch of Crichton style projects, you're not going to be happy.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.280]   If you're a Crichton and you use the, the, you know, your first book taking
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.000]   off to move to the middle of the woods, I can finally now live in the house
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.480]   in Maine, overlooking the water.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.280]   You might be bored.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.480]   You might be depressed.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.160]   You say, what I've just isolated up here.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.080]   This doesn't make me happy.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.920]   So understanding where you fall, I think is important.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.080]   And that was the call I made in that article, recognizing those
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.440]   are two very different types.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.840]   And they're both valid, I think is in itself, very validating for people.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.760]   So when you're doing something like lifestyle centric career
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.440]   planning, you have some clarity.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.400]   So the final question is where do I fall?
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.680]   Well, in the article, I was really clear.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.360]   Grisham is what resonates with me.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.720]   I got some pushback though.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.360]   People say you say Grisham resonates with you, but your life looks
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.280]   more Crichton-y to us from the outside.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.840]   And I think that's a very good point.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.880]   And I guess what I would say is that I'm aspirationally Grisham.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:27.320]   I mean, to me, being able to work autonomously on a hard project on my own
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.240]   terms and my own timings to disappear for a while and just come back into
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.720]   the public eye occasionally, that really resonates when I read that profile
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.760]   of Crichton, it stressed me out, made me anxious.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.400]   So I think I resonate more times Grisham-y.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.120]   Now it looks like I'm doing a lot and partially that's true.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.760]   I'm probably a little bit more in the Crichton spectrum than
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.880]   where I need to end up.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.880]   But partly it's an illusion because I do things sequentially.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.760]   I work on things a little bit at a time.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.600]   This is classic slow productivity, a little bit of time, but with great focus.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.320]   Do that long enough and things begin to pile up, but I'm not necessarily working
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.680]   on all those things at the same time.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.440]   I think the, the podcast newsletter video portion of my empire makes it,
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.640]   makes my activity seem really multiplied.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.560]   But as Jesse will attest, this is a half day venture for me.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.480]   So the way I see all of this, like what you're hearing right now is unlike
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.120]   Grisham, I'm a web 2.0 guy.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.280]   I grew up with the internet.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.880]   So I do like to be able to connect directly with my readers and listeners.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.920]   To me, that's really important, but I keep it confined.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.720]   And so I just have a burst each week of let's do a bunch of stuff to
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.960]   connect with our readers, but it's confined.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.800]   It's not a lot of ongoing projects that are eating up a lot of
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.360]   my time throughout the week.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.200]   So if you put that aside, it's basically writing in CS.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   And if I had to pick an ideal, where would I be when I sell, you know,
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.200]   7 million copies of the firm or whatever my equivalent is, honestly, to me, an
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.400]   ideal would be, I'm always writing.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.640]   I'm always thinking sequentially though, one thing at a time, you know, I'm
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.000]   finishing this book chapter, then I'm writing this New Yorker piece that I'm
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.800]   writing this academic article that I'm writing a couple more book chapters.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.320]   With a half day every week where we do this nonsense so that I'm
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.280]   not just living in a cave.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.400]   To me, that would be great.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.040]   I'd be happy with that.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.680]   I don't need to be directing or whatever the equivalent is
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.760]   of all of Crichton's busyness.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.240]   So anyways, type one, type two, know where you are.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.360]   Use that knowledge to help direct how you approach both your
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.840]   ambitions and your successes.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.360]   And I think it would make people a lot happier.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.640]   Do you think Crichton's still like that?
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.200]   Well, he's dead.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.960]   So he's the ultimate.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.320]   Oh, right.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.360]   I was thinking, yeah.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.920]   So Crichton died in '08 maybe?
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.880]   Cancer.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.560]   He's older.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.920]   By the way, I'm always surprised by how old he was.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.000]   Well, we talked about this before on the show, but you read his first book under
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.680]   his own name, The Adronoma Strain, which again, reads so modern.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.800]   You think this book was from the nineties.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.240]   And yet in the book, no one's landed on the moon yet.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.200]   So that's a long career.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.160]   So he, when he first started writing these things, there were, there
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.560]   were no personal computers.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:09.400]   We hadn't landed on the moon yet, you know, uh, because he's, he was born in 1942.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.880]   I was getting confused with Moneyball.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.240]   Oh, Michael Lewis.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.600]   Uh, yeah.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.560]   I wonder what his deal is.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.920]   He, so he has a podcast with his, his buddy Gladwell's network.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.360]   He writes, uh, usually he's always working on a book.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.600]   I thought he had a, one of these sort of visiting like
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.200]   professorship things at Tulane.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.560]   For a while.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.920]   I mean, I know that's what Isaacson's doing.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.360]   I think Meacham is doing that.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.760]   A lot of these writers, like these sort of that generation of came out of magazines.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.920]   They're in their sixties, uh, Pulitzer winning writers.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.720]   A lot of them have these positions at universities.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.600]   But yeah, I think Lewis is a good example.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.800]   You know, I think he's just like, I just want to write.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.240]   I know both the whole time.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.000]   I was just thinking about Lewis for some reason.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.480]   I don't know why.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.000]   Why don't you go down that rabbit hole too.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.280]   Um, all right.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   So we're almost to our, our very first live call.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.280]   Uh, I first want to mention a sponsor, actually two sponsors that I'm very
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.960]   excited about because this is just coming straight out of my own life.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.360]   So this will be, these are two things I really want to recommend that it
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.120]   will be easy to recommend because this is just pulling from my own life.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.080]   The first is our friends at 8 Sleep.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.480]   The 8 Sleep Pod is the only sleep technology that dynamically cools and
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.880]   heats each side of your bed to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.000]   for what your body needs.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.720]   You can sleep as cold as 55 degrees or as hot as 110 degrees.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.200]   Jesse, I missed my 8 Sleep so much.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.800]   I just got back from Georgia.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.760]   I really missed it there.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.200]   I was staying in a hotel in Georgia, the Marriott.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.000]   And here's what happens at a hotel.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.280]   And I think it happens other places too.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.480]   Is I sleep hot.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.200]   I make the room cold.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.320]   I had that thing rock and rolling at 65 degrees.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.120]   65.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.000]   65 degrees.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.080]   So when you're first getting in the bed in a hotel room at 65 degrees, you
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.120]   think I'll never be warm again.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.840]   Like maybe I'll need extra blankets.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.720]   Like it's freezing.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.560]   I got to get under covers.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.000]   It's like uncomfortable to be outside.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.040]   It takes 10 minutes before you're uncomfortably hot, because what happens
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.600]   is your body heat builds up in those comforters and in the mattress and you're
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:17.920]   hot.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.880]   And I had those covers kicked off by the time I was waking up in the middle of the
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.160]   night.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.400]   This is what the 8 Sleep does.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.480]   It's not about, Oh, I want it to feel really cold on my skin.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.840]   It's that it takes the heat away.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.800]   So that really comfortable feeling you get when you first get into a warm bed on a
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.040]   cool night, before your body heats, warmed it up, you keep it all night long.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.440]   The 8 Sleep is just pulling that heat away through its capillary system.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.360]   And so it always stays comfortable under the, under the comforters.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.480]   So, I mean, 8 Sleep has basically ruined me for travel.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.880]   Cause I, I really notice it now.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.200]   I'm like, man, I miss my 8 Sleep.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.880]   It would be pretty eccentric to bring it with me though, Jesse.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.520]   It's a, you know, it's, you have this big mattress cover and this cool, like
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.880]   spaceship looking pod that maybe is going too far, but you know, this is my evidence
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.280]   that I love my 8 Sleep is now I have a hard time when I'm not with it.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.400]   Uh, they have a lot of data, but I'm not even going to quote the data.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   Take it from me.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.880]   I love it.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.800]   I'm a negative one on their temperature scale.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.600]   I think my wife is a negative two.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.080]   You can set each side differently.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.080]   You control it with an app.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.560]   Uh, I am a big 8 Sleep fan.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.880]   So go to 8sleep.com/deep to save $150 on the pod.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.600]   So you do that slash deep 8sleep.com/deep to get that $150 savings.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.320]   8 Sleep currently ships within the USA, Canada, the UK, select
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.840]   countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.040]   We have a new sponsor today.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.560]   Again, something that I have been using for a long time before they sponsored the
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.680]   show, and that is Masterclass.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.800]   Masterclass is where you can learn from the world's best minds anytime,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.280]   anywhere, and at your own pace.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.120]   You could do it through the website or on their very good app.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.600]   I like their app because it, uh, you can tell it if you want to watch the video,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.960]   or if you're doing something else just to give you the audio, it remembers where you
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.480]   are, so you can remember where you are in all these classes.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.440]   Let me tell you, I've been a subscriber to Masterclass for a while.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.640]   I'll tell you three classes I've done on it.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.880]   So, you know, as people know, I'm a amateur cinephile.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.960]   I really like movies and movie appreciation.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:31.520]   So I did a class with Ron Howard, which is filmed, by the way, the set they filmed
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.960]   Ron Howard's class on is itself cinematic.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.840]   They have like a 30 foot LED wall where he can like show what he's talking about.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.800]   Uh, that was really good because he did scene deconstruction.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.440]   Let's look at this scene from one of my movies.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.560]   Look what the camera is doing.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.560]   Fascinating.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.400]   Then I found a class from Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, Oscar
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.160]   award-winning and Emmy award-winning Aaron Sorkin.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.680]   The cool thing about that class is that there was this extra.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.840]   So some of these classes have extras where it was him teaching a screenwriting
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:10.040]   seminar with students and the students would present their screenplays and Sorkin
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.760]   would give feedback on the screenplays.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.640]   Like that's how you get to the guts of like how does screenwriting work?
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.320]   You see a master actually working with real first time screenwriters
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.560]   and helping them with it.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.440]   Uh, on the writing side, this is the first master, uh, the first class that I viewed
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.160]   once I subscribed for masterclass Gladwell has one really interesting.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.000]   Like he really gets into all of the elements of how he does his writing.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.040]   So if you're a deep questions listener, you are probably already curious about
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.080]   how great minds produce great work.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.360]   You need to be a masterclass subscriber.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.320]   There's over 150 different world-class instructors on there
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.760]   covering all sorts of topics.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.720]   You can get expert knowledge on cool things quickly.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.440]   Great way to go deep.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.120]   So I highly recommend you check it out, get unlimited access to every class.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.520]   And as a deep questions listener, you can get 15% off that annual membership.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.120]   Go to masterclass.com/deep now.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.600]   That's masterclass.com/deep for 15% off masterclass.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.840]   All right.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.480]   We're gonna start our first question block with a something we've been
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.880]   excited about for a while now, a live caller.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.840]   So I can actually talk to someone back and forth.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.080]   Uh, we have video on the live caller too.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.720]   So if you're a YouTube listener, youtube.com/counterpartmedia, you can
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.840]   actually see both of us on the screen.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:47.240]   Our first live caller is Spiros who has questions about lifestyle centric career
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.400]   planning and concerns about falling into the second control trap with his current
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.360]   career that may be going too well.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.640]   And because of that, it is steering him, the pressures of that, or perhaps
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.080]   steering him away from a deeper life.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:01.720]   All right.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.360]   So let's go to our phone line and talk with Spiros.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.600]   All right.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.280]   We have our next caller here.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.480]   Spiros, thank you for calling into the deep questions podcast.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.880]   And now for what I understand, you actually have a case study you want to
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.480]   share with us of some of the principles I talk about actually put into action.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.200]   Yep, exactly.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.240]   So what I would like to do is I would like to talk about how I've been applying.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.600]   So would they can't ignore you since I read it like a long time ago, actually.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.360]   But then I feel like I kind of messed up somewhere along the way.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.160]   So after, after I kind of summarize, I would like us to go into kind of like,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.600]   where did I go wrong and where do I go from here?
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.680]   Sounds good.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.040]   All right.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.800]   So, uh, I moved to the U S from Greece in 2012, like literally 10 years
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.600]   ago to do a PhD in robotics.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.280]   Uh, and I read your book a couple of years later.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.080]   So in 2014, and I was like, Whoa, okay.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.120]   I see what I'm supposed to do.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.000]   So I started applying it first to research, but then I got the opportunity to
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.200]   participate in the 2015 DARPA robotics challenge.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.480]   So then I started applying the principles to robotics software, as
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.040]   opposed to just robotics research.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.840]   That went pretty well.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.520]   I got really, I got really into kind of like the more the software side of robotics.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.280]   Uh, I decided to take a leave of absence to join a robotic startup and that dropping
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.840]   out of the PhD program with a master's did really well in that startup.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.400]   I was the first software engineer.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:30.080]   I hired the team eventually, uh, followed the startup to Austin, Texas in 2016.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.480]   Uh, then moved to San Francisco in 2017 to work for another robotic startup.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.800]   Again, did really well, got promoted, got to travel to Hong Kong and
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.520]   China for manufacturing purposes.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:46.280]   And now since 2018, uh, I've been working for one of the top three, perhaps the top,
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.640]   uh, self-driving car company here in San Francisco.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.560]   Uh, again, I've been doing really well.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.840]   Uh, I've gotten very high performance reviews.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.720]   I've gotten promoted.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.320]   I'm on track to get promoted again.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.760]   Uh, I I'm considered very reliable, high performer, all of, you know, all of the
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.680]   good stuff you would expect from somebody, you know, following these principles.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.680]   Uh, I have tons of options.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.600]   Like, I don't mean to like sound, I don't mean to brag, but like, I get so much
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.120]   recruiter email these days that it's like spam.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.320]   So I do have options.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:20.120]   Um, now the, the reason there now, this is where this is turning from a case
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.200]   that is more to a question.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.480]   I feel like, like to put it in terms of your book, I think I fell
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.000]   for the second control trap.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.080]   I think I got too excited about the, you know, the performance and the
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.920]   promotions and the compensation and the recognition.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:39.040]   Uh, that I've kind of become too busy to, I have too many responsibilities.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.920]   I'm too busy.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.040]   My compensation is too good to ignore if you will.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:43.600]   Yep.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.440]   So, uh, that's kind of where I would like to focus the question part.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.240]   Excellent.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.520]   Excellent.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.200]   Well, let me, let me, first, I'm going to back you up to the beginning of your
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.120]   case study, uh, just for the edification of our audience.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.480]   I want to go back to you as a PhD student.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.560]   You read so good.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.640]   They can't ignore you.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.800]   Now you, you, you glossed over a little bit.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.520]   Oh, I put those principles into play.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.720]   And started becoming very successful in my studies.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.960]   Let's go back and try to make that concrete.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:15.000]   So like, can you identify what did you start doing that let's say other students
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.080]   in your cohort who weren't as successful or you, uh, the passwords yourself weren't
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.200]   doing, let's try to do some differential analysis here, because I'm curious in
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.120]   this beginning point first, and then we'll get to you now.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.880]   Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.760]   I think so.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.600]   B because of your, your own case study in the book, you were also a PhD student
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.040]   and eventually a postdoc, et cetera.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.840]   I was like, Oh, I'm just going to do exactly what Kyle talks about here.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.440]   Kyle talks about, you know, getting a, like a very fundamental research paper
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.760]   and kind of like going deep into the research paper, trying to understand the
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.600]   proofs, trying to understand the results.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.960]   So that's something that I did a schedule some time every week to go through
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.640]   either fundamental papers in my field.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.440]   So I was in a formal methods in robotics, which is like formal
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.040]   verification, formal sentences.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.440]   Anyway.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.320]   Um, which by the way, I'm happy to geek out with you about that.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.240]   We can talk about your improvers and, and we would, uh, we would lose all of our
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   audience, but just let me know.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.560]   I'm restraining myself right now.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.520]   You know, I'm tiptoeing around it on purpose.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.920]   Cause yeah, cause this can be a rabbit hole.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.720]   So that's one thing that I remember very distinctly doing.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.000]   Um, then when, once I got the opportunity though, to participate
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.960]   in the DARPA robotics challenge, I was like, okay, I can apply this here as well.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.800]   So then it shifted from like reading research papers as my, as my deliberate
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.720]   practice, let's say, to learning, uh, learning C plus plus learning Python,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.040]   which are like some fundamental languages for, uh, for this kind of thing.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.160]   And then something called the robot operating system, which is like a
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.800]   middleware for robotics applications.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.680]   So I knew, I knew that these things existed and I knew some
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.760]   programming of course already.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.600]   But I was like, okay, these are the three fundamental things I need to know.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.560]   If I want to write robotics software and like get the robot to actually do something.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.400]   By the way, we go to work like my team for the DARPA robotics challenge, go to work
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.520]   with those like Atlas humanoid robots from Boston dynamics.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.200]   So yeah, pretty, pretty crazy platform to be working on.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.840]   Also terrifying, but yeah, go on.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.960]   And so that's another way I applied that.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.440]   So like I was, for example, I remember very distinctly scheduling blocks at the
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.760]   very beginning of my day, like before I even went to into the, you know, the grad
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.480]   student cubicles or whatever, like I would, I would, let's say, go to a coffee
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.600]   soap or something like that.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   And I would spend like, let's say two hours just going through tutorials, you
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.120]   know, writing code, you know, just deliberate practice.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.000]   Okay.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.120]   So just to clarify for the audience, the first thing you did was it's hard to
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.840]   understand these fundamental papers.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.120]   Having that knowledge will be useful.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.640]   Quick follow up here, because I get this question a lot.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:48.000]   How did you actually structure the reading of hard papers without a formal forcing
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.480]   function?
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.640]   Like I need this for a project I'm working on.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.880]   You just had a system quota.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.560]   How did you do that?
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:59.400]   So, yeah, so, so the way I motivated myself was that, Hey, I'm, I'm seeing that
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.600]   I'm having a hard time with like the very formal aspect of writing.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.880]   So I was able to write research papers, but they were kind of like, they weren't
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.000]   going very deep on the, on the math, on the, on the proof side of things.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.800]   So I was like, okay, I'm going to motivate myself by saying that by
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.280]   understanding the fundamental papers and how these proofs work, I will be able to
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.880]   do that myself eventually.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.720]   Then in terms of like how I structure that, I think it was something like, you
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.040]   know, kick off a note in Evernote, you know, pick a, pick a, pick one of these
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.560]   papers and then schedule time within the week.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.480]   You know, as a grad student, I, you know, you have, like, I, I kind of like
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.960]   reminisce about the flexibility I have in my, I had in my schedule as a grad
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.320]   student.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.320]   I remember scheduling like, yeah, once a month, at least once a month, I have a
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.920]   moment where I just insanely nostalgic for that.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.560]   But anyways, go on.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:45.760]   Yep.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.120]   And so I was, I was, if I recall correctly, this was like eight years ago at this
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.000]   point, I was scheduling time, like on a weekly basis.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.440]   To make sure I get in at least a couple of hours.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.160]   So it's kind of like go over the paper.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.400]   And then the other thing I was doing, which I think you also mentioned in the
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.760]   book is when I was reading like papers around what I was writing around, like
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.920]   papers I wanted to reference, I wanted to cite in my own paper, I wouldn't just
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.480]   like, you know, skim through them or read them and then forget about them on a
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:11.920]   pile.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.880]   I would actually take notes, like in a, in a, I would take digital, I would take
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.520]   notes on the paper and digital notes.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.920]   And I would kind of sketch out what this paper is trying to do and how the, and
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.960]   how it, you know, proves the results.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.800]   Right.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.120]   Well, okay.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.000]   So just to summarize that before we jump now to the current moment, just to
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.600]   summarize that for the listener, what Spiros is doing here, which is straight
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.280]   out of So Good They Can't Ignore You is identifying the thing that is actually
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.880]   valuable in the field where you are, not what you want that answer to be, not what
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.080]   matches how you want your day to go, but what is actually valuable.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.600]   So first off for him, that was understanding how to do this more
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.120]   fundamental theoretical work.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.240]   And then later on, okay, understanding how to use all the different programming
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.600]   language tools that are relevant to the DARPA robotics challenge.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.200]   So I can be as useful as possible.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.840]   And in both cases, what you did, which I think is right, is said, okay, that's
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   the reality of what matters.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.080]   What do I actually have to do to learn that?
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.720]   Oh, it's hard.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.880]   I have to read these hard papers and, you know, I'm in the same place.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.640]   Theoretical computer science is the same as early in your grad student career.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.680]   Understanding papers is how you advance.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.120]   Understanding papers is incredibly hard.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.240]   And those two things are true at the same time.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.880]   And it was a big differentiating factor when I was coming up.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.320]   Those who would wrangle papers and those who would just look for what's easy.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.000]   So I think that's a great example of the principles in action.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.240]   And it worked.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.480]   Okay, so it worked too well.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.400]   So now we jump ahead.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.920]   You're suffering from the second control trap.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.760]   So for people who haven't read that book, the first control trap is trying to get a
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.840]   lot of autonomy in your career before you built up the skills to actually justify it.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.680]   That's where you are 23 and you quit to start your nonprofit that's going to
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.560]   change the world, but you don't know what you're doing.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.640]   The second control trap is when you get enough leverage and skills and power in
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.160]   the marketplace to actually have control of your career is exactly when all of the
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.440]   pressure in the marketplace is going to be to stay, to move up to the next level,
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.720]   to take the higher salary.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.800]   So it's when you're most able to be autonomous is when it's hardest.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.200]   And that's what you're hitting now.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.840]   So why don't you explain to us a little bit more?
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.240]   What is your job like now?
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.280]   What is your, what is your day to day like now?
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.320]   Is it managerial?
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.040]   Is it technical?
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.200]   Let's get a sense of where you are.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   It's yeah.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.760]   So I'm a, my title is a staff software engineer.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.960]   So it sounds like I'm a software engineer, like I'm writing code every day, but I'm
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.120]   not actually writing code every day because at a certain level in the individual
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.560]   contributor, like a real ladder, as we call it, you kind of like fork into
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.480]   different archetypes.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.000]   So there is the software engineer archetype, and this is the person that like
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.160]   writes really good code.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.520]   There is the domain expert archetype.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.320]   This is the person who has like, you know, three PhDs in convex optimization or,
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.600]   you know, machine learning or whatever.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   So domain expert.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.880]   And then there is the archetype that I think I better fit into, which is kind of
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.040]   like high level tech lead is what we call it.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:05.160]   And so this is the person who is able to kind of see, understand how the system
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.640]   works end to end and kind of, you know, coordinate this team with this other team
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.440]   and this other person over here and get this, you know, other subsystem to do the
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.000]   right thing.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.520]   And then you get the entire project or the entire effort to do the right thing just
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.400]   by understanding the system end to end and leading the integration efforts.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   So to put it more concretely, I do everything from, you know, analyzing kind
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:33.200]   of like metrics to see kind of like where we have, you know, gaps, writing project
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.720]   proposals, writing design documents.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.040]   And then once we kind of move into the execution part of the project, I'm usually
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.040]   maybe, maybe I'm running some meetings or not, depending on whether we have a
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.160]   proper program manager support or not.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.400]   I'm coordinating all of these different individuals, you know, software engineers,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.960]   systems engineers, test engineers, sometimes operations teams that are like,
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.680]   you know, handling the self-driving cars on the road.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.120]   So what's a day look like?
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.000]   Is it, how much of it is Slack and email?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.120]   How much of it is?
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.040]   That's, that's exactly where you hit the nail on the head.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.720]   It's very much, you know, hyperactive hive mind modes all the way.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.320]   Like I have to fight really hard just to block out like two hours at the beginning
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.080]   of my day.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.200]   And maybe if I'm lucky, I will actually, you know, get to actually do, do deep
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.480]   work on those two hours.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.680]   Like today I'm on call, for example.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.480]   So like for all I know, once my on-call, you know, shift starts, I will be
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.680]   completely derailed by like a, by like, you know, like an issue coming in on
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.360]   pager duty.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.880]   There is a lot of activity on Slack.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.280]   I've, I've done all sorts of little tips and tricks, you know, applying some of the
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.800]   stuff from, from your books and your podcast to minimize that.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:48.400]   I only check email like one, I try to check only once a day.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:54.000]   I once experimented with going a week without checking work email and nothing
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.880]   terribly happened.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.040]   So I'm very much inclined to keep doing that again.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.200]   But, but like email is okay.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.800]   Slack is where most of the hyperactive hive mind is kind of like operating.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.720]   There are lots of meetings.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.000]   It got much worse, you know, during the lockdown.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.920]   So I'm sure I'm sure others are saying the same, like, it's like, sometimes I feel
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   like, when am I supposed to like use the restroom and like make coffee?
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.760]   Like there's no time in between these meetings.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:19.760]   Which is a first.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.640]   So there is a lot of that.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.160]   There is a lot of that.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:27.240]   Um, like I, I, one of the things I talk to with my manager the most often is like,
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.720]   Hey, I need to feel, we need to figure out a way for me.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.840]   I need to carve out time to do proactive work as opposed to waiting for a problem
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.720]   to arise and then doing reactive work and then fixing the problem.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.000]   Like the reactive work, part of the problem is that reactive work is
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.760]   actually gets recognized a lot.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.640]   So there is like, it's really hard to motivate proactive work when there is
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.240]   tons of reactive work to do and it gets recognized too.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.680]   So that's one challenge.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.280]   But why do you care about it being recognized?
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.560]   Um, Ooh, wow.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.880]   I was not expecting that question.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.800]   Um, when I say recognized, I mean, okay, there's the, there's a recognition in
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.840]   terms of like, you know, like performance reviews and stuff, but there is also the,
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.480]   like doing what the company, the business thinks is most, you know, valuable, you
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.600]   know, right now, this, this, this quarter, this month, you know, this, this year,
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.120]   whatever.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:24.240]   Uh, and it's often the case that what, you know, the business priorities are to deal
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.120]   with their, with the reactive problems.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.680]   They are not to go and, you know, do proactive work.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.560]   All right.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.440]   Well, I'm going to give, uh, I'm going to give a two part answer here and I'm
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.400]   going to be terse because the second part of this answer is something that's probably
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.960]   going to take you weeks of actual thinking to do right.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.120]   So you'll have to check back in.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.800]   I'm going to give you a short term, a short term thing to try and a longterm
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.600]   thing to consider.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.920]   Uh, the short term thing to try is I think this might be a good setup for a deep to
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.560]   shallow work ratio conversation with your manager.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.960]   So I talked about this some in deep work, but then got a lot of feedback from people
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.680]   after that book came out about this particular strategy working well.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.000]   So it's pretty well road tested.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.240]   Uh, and it's where you, you have a conversation like the type you're already
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.720]   having with your manager, but it's a little more quantitative, right?
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.560]   You say, okay, um, this is what deep work is.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.240]   This is what like reactive work is.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.000]   You're in a tech company in San Francisco, so they probably know the term already.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.680]   Um, and you say, what ratio of this sort of reactive shallow to deep proactive do
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.000]   you think is optimal for my position?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.560]   Like what ratio of those two is going to produce the most value net for the
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.160]   organization?
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.280]   So we got to get a number on it and when you have to get quantitative about it, uh,
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.520]   they're not going to come back with the answer.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.040]   I want you to do a hundred percent reactive shallow, right?
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.240]   Because you have this other value, you, you have this training, you can produce new
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.600]   things.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.760]   Um, so when you get a number that they agree to, this often leads to the dissolving
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.600]   of ossification in business culture.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.880]   So it lets let loose a lot of innovations.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.960]   They might say, okay, maybe it should be 50 50.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.080]   So what we're going to do is, you know, mornings now are for you to do proactive
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:03.400]   work.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.080]   No calls start till you're not on call till the afternoon.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.000]   We tell the whole team, don't expect responses.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.080]   That's just an example.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.320]   I don't know your exact situation.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.320]   It might be, you know, Tuesdays and Fridays.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.400]   Uh, you work from not at the office and maybe from somewhere else and you're just
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.120]   doing proactive.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.200]   The quantitative nature of that really makes a difference and the positive
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.480]   orientation makes a difference.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.760]   So it's you coming to your manager saying, how do I produce more for the company?
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.040]   Not you coming to the manager and saying, I'm fed up with you slacking me all the
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:34.480]   time.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.720]   You know, you're terrible.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.640]   The latter conversation doesn't go well.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.680]   The former conversation I have report after report of that working.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   This, there was a short term solution.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.280]   Try that, see how it helps.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.400]   And that might be it.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.360]   My longterm solution.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.280]   I'm going to, I'm going to ask that you, you probably are at a good point.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.480]   And let me actually ask you, how old are you?
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.520]   If you, if you don't mind sharing.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.200]   Yeah, I'm 34.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:54.520]   Okay.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:58.080]   So you're, you're in this sort of heart of the millennial generation approaching
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:58.680]   middle age.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.240]   It's a perfect time to, to start thinking through these questions of, okay, let me
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.840]   step back.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.720]   How are things going in my, my life?
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.200]   What reconfigurations are looming on the horizon?
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.120]   It's a good time to go through a serious lifestyle centric, uh, career planning
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.880]   exercise where you really look out.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   I would look at 40 and 50 as age targets.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.760]   And like we talked about on the show, have this really clear vision of, of
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.160]   all aspects of your life in an ideal world at that point, not just work, but
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.440]   where you live, what you're doing with your time, who you're around, see it,
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.280]   smell it, taste it.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.560]   We like to say, uh, get that vision for 40, get that vision for 50.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.200]   And then look backwards and say, how do I get there?
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.880]   And in answering that question, you may end up saying, okay, my current career
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.840]   trajectory, that's fine.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.520]   I just have to do this deep to shallow work ratio.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.040]   Maybe do a lateral move at some point into more, you know, you could maybe
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.520]   figure it out, or you might end up with an answer.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.200]   You say, I have a lot of skills.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.720]   I am a, an ML robotics expert engineer.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.120]   Okay.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.680]   Why don't I take that out for a spin?
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.040]   And I can actually maybe do something drastically different.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.040]   I'm on contract.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.360]   I work six months out of the year.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.920]   I live on Vancouver Island.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.280]   You know, I mean, you could, you have a lot of flexibility.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.840]   So short term, I would do that ratio conversation long-term.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.920]   I would say, let's, let's go through that exercise in detail and just see where
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.680]   it leads you and don't be afraid if it leads you to, I'm more or less close.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.280]   I see to make some tweaks or if it leads you to, you know, I'm about to
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.480]   buy a ranch outside of Austin, you know, it could, it could lead you in a lot
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.080]   of different directions to be open to all of that.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.760]   How does that, how does those as a one, two punch, how does that
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.040]   sound as a potential way forward?
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.720]   I'm glad the conversation went there because I kind of anticipated this
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.840]   and I've already like, I've already done the first draft of what you just
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   described, knowing that it was, you know, it could come up, but should
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.000]   I, should I actually go into it?
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.040]   Okay.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.200]   Give us the, give us the, the, the brief summary of the, the ideal
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.440]   lifestyle picture you're playing with.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.120]   So the brief summary is that I, so I'm originally from Greece, right?
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.880]   So I want to, I want to get to a point where I can, I can spend more
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.320]   or less every summer in Greece.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.520]   Working, not working doesn't really matter.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.400]   Um, spend, you know, about six months out of the year in the U S and then
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.680]   spend another quarter, you know, just working from somewhere else.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.080]   Um, other things I want to be doing, I want to be able to be near the water.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:20.840]   I love swimming.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.760]   You know, I love, I love water sports and whatnot.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.960]   So I want to be able to do that.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.920]   Uh, I wanna, I want to start writing.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.400]   I wrote a few blog posts and articles back in grad school.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.000]   Um, and I really enjoyed that, but I gave that up later
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.160]   on to focus on my career.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.520]   So when I get back into, uh, into writing, maybe eventually actually
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.840]   write a book, we'll see about that.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:45.520]   Um, I want to, uh, so I I'm currently single.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.640]   So eventually I want to be able to meet somebody now.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.040]   I feel like I'm so busy or so exhausted that I don't even like
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.200]   make enough time in my schedule for dating.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.720]   So I definitely want to, uh, you know, uh, like the connection back
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.200]   at the suffering essentially to put it in deep life terms.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.440]   Um, other things in there, funny, you mentioned Austin.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.960]   It's actually Austin is on that roadmap because I figured that if I were to move
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:12.280]   to Austin, which is central time, but I work Pacific time hours, then I get two
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.520]   extra hours in the morning when I still have energy and willpower to do things
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:21.400]   like deep work, to do things like writing before I engage with the hyperactive hive
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:21.680]   mind.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.320]   So Austin is actually on the trajectory, uh, potentially.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.360]   Well, okay.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:31.920]   Um, I mean, it sounds like to me, uh, you're, you're heading down the path
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.480]   towards changing your career situation.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:40.640]   If that lifestyle sounds like either a, a, uh, greatly reconfigured job at your
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:46.040]   current employer or a different setup altogether, that's maybe more freelancer
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:46.880]   contractor based.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.240]   Is that a scary thought for you?
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.080]   Or is that where you you've led yourself already?
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:50.800]   I will.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.560]   Exactly.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.000]   You you're, you're spot on again.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.520]   What is scary is I don't want to, in my attempt to escape the second control trap,
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.280]   I don't want to accidentally veer all the way to the first control trap.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.280]   Cause it'd be easy to say, you know, screw all of these.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.560]   I have enough money in the bank to last me, you know, X many years.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   I'm just going to quit.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   I'm just going to say, you know, screw Silicon Valley.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.440]   I'm going to go to.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   You know, Mexico and work on my book or whatever, but then I would be probably
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.800]   falling for the first control trap if I go so extreme.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.240]   Yep.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.000]   So the, like the scary challenge is bridging the gap between like where I am
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.080]   right now and kind of this vision for my, for when I'm 40 or when I'm 50.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.160]   Well, okay.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:28.840]   This is great.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.600]   So, so in the first answer, we got to, I got to give some generic advice about deep
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.880]   to shallow ratios as a first step and lifestyle center career planning.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.080]   Now we get an example of lifestyle center career planning.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.000]   So I can give you a, a, a piece of advanced advice that goes to lifestyle center
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.400]   career planning implementation and, and you're spot on about, you don't want to
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.040]   fall back into the first control trap.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   You're not going to be happy if you say, I'm going to go to, you know, rent a
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.920]   house in Cabo and just work on my book.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.200]   It that'll last a month before you start to get antsy.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.480]   So what I'm always looking for in this situation is concrete exemplars.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.240]   I'll often talk about the rule of three.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:11.960]   So you want to find a real person who has your background, who has a professional
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.120]   setup that resonates, Hey, that works.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:14.360]   Okay.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.400]   Here's how they did it.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:21.080]   Oh, I, they're a, a, they're a contractor that works on this type of ML project
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.640]   or whatever, like it's concrete.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.120]   This is someone, and it's a, it's a, a job that they do.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.600]   It's a six month a year job.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.720]   It's a flexible enough job that they take summers off.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.960]   They go up to New England in the summer.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.480]   So real people doing with your skillset, what you want to do.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.120]   Rule of three is if you want to be really secure, find three different
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.400]   people doing something like that.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.920]   So now, you know, it's not a one-off it's actually a viable path, but
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:47.320]   have a specific, a specific target that you're working backwards from this guy,
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.360]   her and him did this set up with my type of skillset.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.800]   How do I move there?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.720]   I mean, I will say I'm doing that in some of my own lifestyle centric
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.560]   midlife career planning I've been doing.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.760]   I don't share a lot of details about exactly what I'm thinking about because
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   there's a lot of stakeholders involved, but this has been my approach is what
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.080]   I'm seeking is examples.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:13.240]   I'm seeking people with similar backgrounds who have already figured out
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.960]   a configuration that seems to work.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.000]   That's how I think you can avoid the first career trap.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.400]   I think you're there right now.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.640]   The seeking stage.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.320]   Go see out these examples, meet the people also, by the way, say, can I call you?
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.880]   Can I take you out for coffee?
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:29.200]   If they're local, people are happy to share details of their
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.720]   experience and get concrete with them.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.920]   How did you make this change?
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.920]   What are the hard parts?
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.000]   What advice do you have?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.200]   I don't know if you ever talk, you probably didn't, but in that top
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.240]   performer course I did with Scott Young, we talked a lot about this, this
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.200]   journalistic approach to career development where it's like you're off
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.960]   that course, but I haven't taken it.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.800]   No, we have students actually go through this.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   It's like you're writing a article on how this specific type of job transition works.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.440]   You're out there doing research, gathering real information, always concrete.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.200]   Always like this is something that people are actually doing.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.280]   Um, and I think you were ready to start looking for those exemplars, which is
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.440]   also an exciting part of the process because you get all the aspiration
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.080]   without actually having to yet do anything to scary.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.280]   So, you know, good for you.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.320]   I think you're in the fun part.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.400]   Uh, but I would.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.200]   No reason why you can't start just trying to find people right now who come out of
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.080]   your background, who have a setup where they, they work eight months a year.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.000]   They work six months a year.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.040]   They're location independent.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.840]   I'm sure they're out there in your field.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.280]   Uh, there may be an academic affiliation.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.000]   There may be a nonprofit affiliation.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.880]   Maybe they're a fellow at the open AI, whatever.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.120]   And there's so many options out there for your field.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.320]   I think you're ready to start looking for concrete examples.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.880]   This makes a lot of sense and really resonates.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.520]   I didn't, you've mentioned this before, but I never, you know, pieced it together.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:43.840]   You're right.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.840]   That's what I need to do.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.640]   Excellent.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.280]   Well, Spiros, keep me posted.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.600]   I want to know what you end up doing.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.360]   Uh, and maybe I'll, we'll follow up and we'll share that with the audience.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.720]   But in the meantime, you know, thanks for the case study.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.560]   Thanks for the questions.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.800]   And also an excuse for me to go through a lot of different advice.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.200]   So I find that useful as well.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:52:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.320]   So, all right.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:00.800]   So good luck for you.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.440]   Thanks very much.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.760]   Thank you, Kyle and Jesse.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.160]   Bye.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.400]   All right.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.520]   So there we go.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.640]   Our first live call.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.360]   I enjoyed that.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.680]   We have more of those to come, so stay tuned.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.920]   And if you have feedback, of course, you can always send us notes
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.680]   to, uh, jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.920]   All right.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.440]   So let's move on now with, uh, some written questions.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.840]   Let's see, Jesse, do you have the, uh, the written questions?
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.400]   To me now we've got kind of a culture shock here.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.800]   We've just talked to someone live and now we're going to written
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.040]   questions, but we do it all on here.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.280]   All right.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.360]   What's our first written question?
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:35.760]   Of the day.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.560]   Uh, first question is from Philip.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:44.320]   He says you got started by blogging, but what are your thoughts about using
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.400]   private journaling or building creativity or even a writing career?
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.760]   Like, so what are your thoughts for using journaling to, you know, build that?
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:58.880]   Well, so Philip, my thought on becoming a better writer is the best way to do this
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.200]   is to write, but in particular to write for audiences where there's feedback.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.400]   So you have some sort of feedback function that is going to apply pressure
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.600]   to your craft to try to improve it.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.080]   So that could mean writing for editing.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.920]   So there could be an editor that needs to either accept or reject your piece.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.960]   And if it's not good enough, they'll reject it or they've commissioned the
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.600]   piece, but they're going to be editing it.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.120]   And you, you have that feedback in your mind of, if this is not good,
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.320]   they're going to be disappointed.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.360]   There's going to be a lot of work to do.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.280]   I want to impress them.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.040]   It can also mean writing for an online audience.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.520]   If you have other metrics to look at, such as it could be views or clicks.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:41.600]   It could be more the direct feedback you get from your readers, the comments,
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.800]   they leave the emails, they send you, was this thing clicking or not?
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.360]   Did this, if you're a tech writer, get picked up on hacker news and do well,
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.560]   how is the subscribers to my email list doing?
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.960]   So you can get online metrics now as well, but what you want is writing
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.240]   for an audience with feedback.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.400]   It's that stretch to want to optimize or improve that feedback
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   function that you get better.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.600]   That's where you get the deliberate practice effect.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:09.120]   Writing to a private journal is not going to generate that.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.920]   So as a source of making you a better writer, writing your private journal,
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.240]   it's not going to directly improve your craft.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.400]   There are other benefits to it.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.720]   I see here in the elaboration of your question, you mentioned that the book,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:29.280]   The Artist's Way, talks about private journaling as a way to increase creativity.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.600]   And that might be the case.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:35.640]   If you're a novelist, doing private journaling on ideas might surface more
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:40.480]   random recombinations and connections of ideas in your mind and help you pull out
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.120]   more grist for the creative mill.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.320]   So I could believe that if you're a nonfiction, like idea writer, I think
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.160]   taking notes on thoughts you have, different theories or connections between
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.520]   ideas, you don't want to lose that.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.360]   So having a place to take notes that could help as well.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:57.680]   So my summary is as grist for material.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.440]   That material, then yeah, private journaling could help.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.320]   I don't, but it could help for making you a better writer.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.160]   You have to write for people who care and you have to care about how
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.360]   they feel about what you're writing.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.880]   That's what's going to push you to improve.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.840]   All right.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.600]   What's our next question.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.840]   All right.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.600]   Next question is from Alessandro, a 24 year old from Italy.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.240]   What are some examples of keystone habits for the community bucket?
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:27.480]   Yeah, I've got this question a few times, a really brief review
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.800]   for those who are new to the show.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.400]   One of the methods we talk about on here for developing what we call the deep life
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.560]   is to divide your life into these different categories that we call buckets that cover
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.720]   different aspects of what's important for you.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.880]   And the method we often propose is you start with a keystone
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.120]   habit in each of these buckets.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.960]   Just something you do every day to signal to yourself that you take each of these
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.800]   parts of your life seriously to single self-efficacy to yourself.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.840]   I am able to do things that's not required or mandatory just
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   because I think it's important.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:02.960]   And then step two is you rotate from bucket to bucket and spend a month or two
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.120]   on each overhauling that part of your life.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:05.520]   All right.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.000]   Alessandro is saying, and I've heard this again from multiple people.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.080]   The community bucket.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:16.120]   So the bucket where it's you sacrificing non-trivial time and intention on behalf
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.680]   of other people or people who are important to you, it's not always obvious.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:25.400]   What's a daily habit to do there in the same way that it might be more obvious for
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:30.280]   craft, it might be something like I do an hour of deep work every morning or for
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.320]   constitution, it might be, I walked in thousand steps a day.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:34.680]   What's the equivalent for community.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:38.280]   I wrote down three ideas here just to get you thinking, Alessandro.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:44.720]   Um, write, text, or call someone, you know, every day, you know, it could just be,
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.800]   Hey, a friend there, I was thinking about you.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.000]   You thought my things was interesting.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.960]   Calling your parents as you're driving home from work, seeing what's going on
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.520]   with the sibling, but just in this discipline, if I take a little time out
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.520]   of every day, just to keep touches on different people in my life, see what's
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:58.880]   going on.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:04.280]   Idea number two, perhaps there's an online community that you're involved in.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.920]   That's very important to you.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.800]   People that share a certain interest or a philosophical or theological orientation,
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.320]   or they're involved in, uh, a niche hobby, whatever it is, right.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.760]   But maybe you have an online community.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.920]   Hopefully that doesn't exist in a massive public.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.560]   Mind warping social media platform.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.000]   Hopefully this is in something that's more controlled and niche and more of a long
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.560]   tail social media type environment.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.920]   And maybe you do something every day on that community.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.520]   You post something or another type of useful effort.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:38.280]   You do 20 minutes of moderation on their forum, whatever it is, whatever helps keep
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.400]   that community up and running.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.080]   So you feel connected to that online community.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.200]   You're giving it energy every day.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:51.920]   Idea three, I talk about this in deep work, something, whatever your equivalent
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:54.360]   is of daily Torah study.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:59.840]   I thought this was a really cool example from, from my book, deep work, uh, in the
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:05.520]   Orthodox Jewish community, there's this tradition of you read Torah every morning.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.840]   There's a page a day, there's a way to break this up.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.760]   So it's a page a day.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.200]   I don't know page means that there's a scroll, but whatever it's, you know, one
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:13.960]   reading per day.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.240]   Um, and there's a tradition where you do it with a partner.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.200]   Probably say the word wrong.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.840]   Uh, Shavrusa, Shavrusa.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.880]   I'm saying, I'm not saying that right, probably.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.640]   But, uh, what, what they do is they, it's usually early in the morning before people
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.800]   have to get to work and you have a partner and you sit there and you study a page of
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.680]   Torah every morning.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.320]   There we go.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.160]   That's just an example or whatever the equivalent is in your faith community of
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.160]   every day doing something with someone else.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.120]   There's a bunch of us in the same room connects you to that, connects you to that
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:44.400]   community.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:44.640]   All right.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.560]   Those are just examples, Alessandro, but that's the type of thing that have to be
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.840]   major, but it's not trivial.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.520]   It's tractable.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.280]   It might take some sacrifice some days, but you can almost always get this done.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.880]   Uh, but it's not over the top.
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.000]   It's not, I have to spend four hours a day, you know, hosting a live event or
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.680]   something like that.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.120]   So those are the type of keystone habits I have in mind for the community bucket.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.200]   All right.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.800]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:16.520]   Uh, next is from JP, a 43 year old from Montreal, and he's looking for a deep dive
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.400]   with concrete examples of a template of a quarterly plan.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.320]   Yeah, I like this.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.440]   Let's stay nuts and bolts.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440]   All right.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.800]   So background here, I'm a big proponent of multi-scale planning.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.920]   So you have a quarterly or semester plan that you look at.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.760]   Each week when you build your weekly plan, you look at your weekly plan each day,
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.360]   when you build your daily time block plan.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.480]   So you're controlling your time and energy on multiple different scales.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.760]   That's what allows you to take advantage and mold your time, uh, optimally
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.280]   at different types of levels.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.920]   You need all three of those levels in there.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.680]   There's a lot of variety for what people put into these quarterly or semester plans.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.720]   Uh, the prepare for this, I went and just looked at mine before we went on the,
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.240]   before we went on the live stream.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.880]   I looked at mine before we went on the, before we went on the air today, I
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:12.160]   maintained two, one for my professional life and one for my life outside of work.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.440]   And the thing that struck me about my professional life on when I was looking
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.920]   at it, my plan for the fall, the semester we're in or quarter we're in right now
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:26.360]   is it's pretty brief, honestly, like a normal weekly plan.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.520]   I have more text in it than my plan for the entire fall semester.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:36.120]   I mean, so when I was looking at it, basically it was, um, there's three
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.760]   things in there and I'm talking sentences with a few bullet points under them for
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.080]   each.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.800]   So there is a Georgetown academic work.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.680]   It's at least so, you know, it's not that many things to say here.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.080]   Like this is, uh, I'm working on these two academic papers and, um, you know,
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.920]   there's a administrative type thing I'm working on.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.880]   The details don't matter, but just boom, boom, boom.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.120]   Right.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.240]   Writing.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.800]   It's not that complicated.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.000]   Uh, this is where I want to be.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.120]   Like I'm writing my book.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.960]   I'm working on my book, slow productivity.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.680]   Uh, this is where I want to be by the end of semester.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.720]   Here are some miles.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.080]   I broke it out month by month milestones for the semester that's there.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.160]   And I'm doing some New Yorker stuff and I know what's coming up and I have a
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.680]   couple of notes there on how I want to interleave it.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.640]   All right.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.040]   That's it.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.800]   And then for, uh, I always call it the online empire, but the, the media
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.280]   company, the podcast video and newsletter, we have things, just to
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   have some things we're working on.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.880]   I have some bullet points to remind me of like the objectives, like where do
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.040]   I want to be by the end of the fall?
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.320]   We're talking about, it doesn't take up a whole page.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.720]   My Google doc, like if you printed it, it could fit on one page.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.520]   Right.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.880]   So these, these aren't essays.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.000]   It's not complicated prose.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.520]   It's not Gantt charts.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.680]   It's not spreadsheets full of different milestones.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.360]   It's like get three chapters done and get this article done in between.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.080]   And make sure you look into the possibility of shifting, like
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.200]   for the summer doing X.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.120]   Like it's, we're talking about that level of detail.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.080]   It seems like that's not enough information to help, but it makes
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.600]   all the difference in the world because now you have that in mind.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.720]   You're doing your weekly plan.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.280]   You're like, well, okay, if I'm going to finish this chapter by the end of this
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.760]   month, then this week, I really Tuesday of this week, I need to maybe take that
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.840]   over for writing because the Thursday and Friday are busy, this little bit of
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.440]   information unlocks a, a large volume of decision guidance about all this other
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.920]   stuff that happens in your life at smaller scales, right?
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.000]   So JP, it does not have to be complicated.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.360]   In fact, the higher scale you go, the simpler these things get, because
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.200]   you're talking to such a big granularity.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.360]   You can only get so many things done when you're talking
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.280]   about pretty big objectives.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.400]   So these things get simpler.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.120]   Uh, don't overthink it.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.440]   Don't overwrite, don't over detail it.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.120]   You just giving your energy for the next few months, some guides
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.640]   that the roughly guide it down.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.120]   Trust your weekly daily habit to then focus that.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.320]   So with your personal quarterly plan, is that just kind of keeping an eye on
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.360]   things outside of your time blocking for the day?
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.560]   Cause you do that outside of work.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.520]   So like that'll have, um, objectives and goals.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.560]   So like, let's say you're changing, you have new objectives, fitness
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.600]   wise, or something like that.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.600]   Like that would be on there.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.280]   Um, it's like health and fitness stuff would be in there.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.480]   A lot of family stuff, you know, you know, we want to do what's coming up.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.760]   This, you know, this fall while we got a bunch of birthdays, you know, the fall is
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.880]   always complicated for our family.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.360]   Cause we have Halloween, which we, we have high Holy days.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.120]   So then Halloween really kicks off the busyness because we take Halloween
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.880]   seriously and then I have a son has a birthday the week after Halloween.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:41.240]   Um, then we have, uh, Thanksgiving and then another son has a birthday right
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.120]   after that, then you get into the whole holiday season.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.240]   It's like, we're constantly buying gifts.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.080]   We're constantly doing decorations.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.840]   And so just having a reminder of that, I might pull back on other things.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.640]   The winter, I typically will have like some more ambitious plans for the kids.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.000]   Like, okay, we're going to set this up.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.080]   We're going to learn how to do this.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.440]   We're going to, we're going to have these projects, you know, because the
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.040]   winters are otherwise dark and less crowded.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.280]   So all that type of stuff goes in there.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:07.120]   So for the, for the technicalities of when you look at your quarterly and
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.520]   you're doing your weekly plan, like every day in the time block that that's
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.480]   outside the time blocking for your working hours.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:12.880]   So, right.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.480]   Most of the time.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.480]   So, so, uh, I mean, sometimes it's not right.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.200]   I mean, personal stuff, if it happens during my work hours, it has to be, it'll
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.000]   be integrated the time block plan, but it's also a very effective way, by the way, to
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.440]   make progress on like annoying personal things, like, ah, I got to do the family
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:34.280]   budget or I got to go, you know, uh, I'm, we're doing financial planning stuff right
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:34.480]   now.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.040]   Like I got up, up some insurance.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:43.320]   I have to change the retirement deductions or whatever from like Georgetown.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.920]   And like, that's actually a good thing to maybe capture.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:51.720]   Uh, here's an hour on Wednesday from two to three, like use time block energy for
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:52.080]   that stuff.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.520]   So I'll often like grab those things inside it, but yeah, for the evenings it'll be,
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.480]   um, it's the beginning of the week.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.000]   I'm looking at my strategic plan, looking at my personal plan for the semester.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.840]   I see like, oh, we are, uh, we're one of our objectives for January is to get to this
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.240]   new milestone with our maker lab.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.160]   So like, okay, I'm looking at my week.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.600]   Why don't I choose an evening this week that we can go here and then that'll go
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.360]   into my weekly plan.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:16.600]   Like, yeah.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.120]   Tuesday after, after pickup from the bus stop, let's go straight to
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.400]   the, the maker lab or whatever.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.800]   Yep.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.680]   So there's the nuts and bolts.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.200]   All right.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.560]   What do I got next?
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:28.480]   All right.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.040]   Next question is from Jay.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.040]   How do you choose what book to read next?
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.920]   Good question, Jay.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:41.040]   There's two main ways that books come onto my radar of things I need to read.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.360]   Uh, it's either functional.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.960]   So I need it for research.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.400]   Maybe I'm working on an article or I'm working on a book chapter and I need to
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.200]   read something because I need to know that information.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:57.840]   So there's functional ways that things come onto my, uh, onto my list of
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.360]   things to read, everything else is inspirational.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.000]   That looks interesting.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.640]   Let's get that and read that as soon as possible after I get it.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.560]   So it's sort of like spontaneous or functional or
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.880]   inspirational and functional.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.760]   Uh, so I just looked here.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.720]   I have four books I bought.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.800]   I bought four books in the last week.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.000]   So I thought I would just go through those and I'll for each let
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.400]   you know, uh, what the motivation was.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.680]   These are four books that hopefully I'll probably read these all within
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.520]   the next three or four weeks.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.120]   That'd be the idea.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.480]   Um, so I bought first man by James Hansen.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.680]   So James, it's a biography of Neil Armstrong.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.720]   It's because I was watching Damon, uh, Damon Chazelle's movie first man,
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.360]   which by the way is underrated.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.120]   I think it's a fantastic movie, especially if you can watch it on a good
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.520]   screen with a good sound system.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.400]   I don't want to geek out about, you know, his use of 16 millimeter
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.520]   film and the cockpits, and there's like a lot of really
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.960]   interesting decisions he makes.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:57.840]   Uh, it's Ryan Gosling and, uh, Claire Foy from the crown, whatever.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.160]   So I was watching this movie, which is great.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.800]   And the guy I want to write, I want to read the book it's based off of.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.000]   So that was just inspiration.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:03.680]   Let's do this.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.960]   Karen Armstrong's new book, sacred nature.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.360]   I love Karen Armstrong's work.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.040]   I talked about the case for God and the history of God a lot on this podcast.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:17.000]   He has a new book out about the ways that people have found, uh, sacredness
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.120]   and nature throughout history.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.880]   I mean, of course I'm on board for that type of thing.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.520]   I saw that just mentioned in the New Yorkers roundup of the best
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520]   books of the year so far.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.000]   Boom.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.560]   Just ordered that short book.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.880]   You know, I'll read it in a few days.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.720]   Very excited for that.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.400]   Uh, I also bought super intelligence by Nick Bostrom.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.240]   This is an AI ethics type book.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.880]   Uh, it's for an article, right?
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.080]   So that's more like homework.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.200]   I'm reading a chapter every morning of that.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.360]   And then there's 15 chapters.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.400]   I'm reading a chapter every morning as a baseline, and then I'm going to throw in
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.760]   here and there extra sessions to read a couple more chapters here and there.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.360]   So, so I can get it done within 10 days would be nice.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.080]   And then, uh, I also just bought right before I came here, John
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.960]   Meacham's new Lincoln biography.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.160]   I am a big, uh, I'm a Lincoln fan.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.520]   I read a lot of Lincoln stuff, but I'm particularly excited about
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.240]   Meacham's new biography for a lot of reasons.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.000]   I read a great review of it in the Washington post book world this weekend.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.680]   And so that's on its way.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.480]   That's a big book.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.360]   I'll find, I'll find time to read it.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.200]   I want to get that done in November if I can as well.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:17.760]   So there you go.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.840]   It's a mix of inspiration and functionality.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.840]   And if I get inspired, I buy it.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.200]   I want to get into that book before the inspiration dies down.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.480]   When you're reading enough, you can get through a lot of books.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.360]   So on a given month, how many books do you read or how
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.160]   many books do you buy?
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:33.520]   Sorry.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.560]   Um, I mean, five.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.120]   Probably.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.680]   So last week you bought a lot of your quota.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.240]   I have all I need for the next month.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.080]   But sometimes I, I mean, sometimes I buy in books.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.680]   I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I need
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.000]   like this chapter and that chapter for an article
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.720]   or book research and like that's worth 25 bucks to me.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.520]   If I can get a good example out of something, but,
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.080]   but yeah, I bought a lot of my quote in a big burst.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.640]   And then you take trips to the library too
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.600]   every once in a while too, right?
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.880]   And, uh, we have little free libraries in my town.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.320]   They're really big.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.880]   My town is really big on these little free
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.920]   libraries are everywhere.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.120]   And I get a lot of good books out of those.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.000]   It's just a take a book, leave a book type system.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.400]   Are those on the side of the road?
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.160]   Okay.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:16.480]   I've seen.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.360]   Have you seen them to like, they look like mailboxes.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.080]   I walked by one.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.880]   You can, I mean, this is like Willy Wonka's
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.240]   factory for me, for my personality is this town.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.040]   It's like, just wander around and just pick up
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.920]   free books from these like well-educated people's,
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.840]   like their professors, little free libraries and
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.200]   just walk around and just like pick up free books.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.520]   So when you're done picking up free books, go
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.280]   to like one of our mini coffee shops to just
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.040]   sort of like sit and drink coffee and read.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.160]   And it's a cool town.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.520]   It's a good, it's a good match for me though.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.920]   I should stop promoting it because we don't
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.280]   want too many more people to move here.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.040]   It's getting expensive.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.080]   So yeah.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.480]   Do not move here.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.840]   Helps your house value though.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.960]   It does help the house value.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.720]   There's a cool town.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.360]   It's quaint.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.480]   It has a lot of books and good coffee shops.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.200]   That's all good.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.160]   Infested with werewolves.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.520]   So just, you know, caveat emptier, otherwise great.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.400]   Good books, good coffee.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.400]   You may have your flesh be devoured by a
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.760]   lichen trope, so you just got to balance that out.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.480]   All right.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.760]   We've got another good block of questions here.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.320]   Let me just take a quick break to talk about
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.680]   another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.360]   And that's our good friends at ZocDoc.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.120]   ZocDoc is a free app that shows you doctors
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.920]   who are patient reviewed, take your insurance.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.240]   And are available when you need them.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.320]   On ZocDoc, you can find every specialist under the sun.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.200]   Whether you're trying to straighten those teeth,
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.560]   fix an achy back, get that mole checked out,
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.840]   or your wounds from werewolves attacks,
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.160]   because you moved to Tacoma park.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.000]   They can look at those.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:47.640]   They'll get it swabbed.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.720]   ZocDoc has what you need.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.400]   I mean, this just makes sense.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.920]   Look, I need a dentist.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.280]   How do I find a dentist?
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.400]   I could ask a few people and then try to
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.480]   get on the phone with them, or you could go to ZocDoc.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.560]   Here's the dentist in my area.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.680]   Let me read the reviews.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.400]   Let me see if they take my insurance.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.200]   Let me sign up right there on the website.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.800]   This makes a lot of sense.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.680]   I currently have two doctors in my life that use
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.000]   ZocDoc, my dentist and my primary care physician.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.160]   So that makes things really easy.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.680]   I really like how I can fill out paperwork online.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.360]   I don't have to do it on the clipboard when I get there.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.280]   So I am a fan of ZocDoc because of all of those
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:30.680]   features and also because I like reading out their URL.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.760]   ZocDoc.com, my favorite URL to read.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.920]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep and download the ZocDoc
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.480]   app for free, then you can start your search for a
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.640]   top rated doctor today, many available within 24 hours.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.200]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.560]   ZocDoc.com/deep.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.440]   Say it three times fast and they'll give you a hundred thousand dollars.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.080]   This is where I have to do the, the advertiser disclaimer voice
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.920]   and say a hundred thousand dollar prize, not guaranteed.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.360]   One other sponsor I want to talk about, this one I'm excited about.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.880]   It's called Giving What We Can.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.880]   This was co-founded, if it sounds familiar, it's co-founded by William
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:16.280]   McCaskill, the effective altruist philosopher at Oxford who, who did
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.040]   80,000 hours, which we talked about on the show as well.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.040]   So he has this co-founded this new group, which I'm, which I am excited
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.360]   about called Giving What We Can.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.960]   So this helps you answer the key question of which charity should I give to you?
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:37.040]   Which charity is going to be most effective in spending my money?
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.000]   This is what Giving What We Can, where it enters the picture because
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.720]   they've done this research for you.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.800]   Founded by William McCaskill and another philosopher named Toby Ord.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.720]   Its goal was to try to figure out, their goal is to try to figure out how to help
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.480]   others give as effectively as possible.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.240]   So that's why Giving What We Can takes your ability to do
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.320]   good in the world seriously.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.680]   Searches for evidence-backed donation opportunities to help
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.640]   you maximize positive impact.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:06.040]   The recommendations are backed by tens of thousands of hours of research by expert
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.160]   charity evaluators and grant makers.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:15.600]   So you can be confident that your donation translates into real world impact.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.840]   Otherwise, look, you see a slick website.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.320]   I don't know.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.520]   You see a bumper sticker.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.400]   You're like, Hey, why not?
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.720]   Why don't I give to this charity?
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.360]   What is this?
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:28.080]   You know, over here, it's the, the Deep Work HQ Skeleton
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.200]   Fund or something like that.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.560]   And then you realize I just gave a hundred thousand dollars to this
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.320]   charity so that Cal and Jesse can do nonsense with skeletons in their, in
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.760]   their ad, in their HQ or something like this, right?
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.280]   You don't want to make that mistake, but you also don't have hundreds of
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:46.120]   hours to research in detail how effective charities actually are
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.320]   at converting money to good.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.200]   So you go to Giving What We Can, they've done the research for you.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.240]   Now you can put not only your money to use, but put it to use
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.760]   as effectively as possible.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.960]   Um, so over 20,000 donors worldwide right now, trust Giving What We Can.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:09.400]   You should join their group, go to givingwhatwecan.org/deep to maximize
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.120]   the impact of your donations this giving season that's givingwhatwecan.org/deep.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.200]   Don't forget the slash deep.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.880]   That's how they know you came from us.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.360]   All right.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:20.920]   Well, I think we have time.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   Let's do a couple more questions.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.840]   Jesse, what do we got?
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.880]   All right.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.440]   Sounds good.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.800]   Question from Aaron, a 30 year old from Boston.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:33.520]   Cal's alluded to sleep issues and often mentions caffeine consumption, Bevco,
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.760]   et cetera, stuff like that.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.400]   The coffee shops around Tacoma Park.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.200]   I'm curious about his philosophy on caffeine.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.720]   Well, first of all, Aaron, uh, I don't know where you get this idea
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.120]   that I drink a lot of caffeine.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.480]   For those who are watching or listening, instead of watching, you will see what
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:55.880]   is, uh, one of the world's largest coffee cups in my hand, not as big as the coffee
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.480]   cup from the HBO show, Veep, the chief of staff's coffee cup, but this one is
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.520]   actually branded from our ad agency that does all our podcast ads.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.120]   I think this is their way of trying to keep me sharp so we can, we can sell more ads.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.360]   Um, here's my, my caffeine philosophy.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.040]   Uh, a, I drink a lot of it.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.840]   So here's the backstory.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:15.160]   I got, I got started drinking coffee in high school.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.200]   So I went to high school at a public school in Mercer County, New Jersey, which is the
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   county that includes Princeton, New Jersey.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.000]   And I, I blew through this, not gonna surprise people, but I blew through all of
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.320]   the available computer science instruction.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.800]   By the time I was a sophomore, I took the AP course when I was a sophomore, got a
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.200]   five, I was sort of like out of computer science stuff to do.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.760]   And they had a agreement with Princeton university that they could send students
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.280]   from the high school who were sort of bored in certain topics to Princeton.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.280]   Tuition free to take some courses at Princeton.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:53.240]   So, uh, in high school, I started taking the, the computer science sequence at, at
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.960]   Princeton, and I would stop at the tiger Mart on route 31 and pick up flavored
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.000]   coffee and those cheap styrofoam cups.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.840]   And so early on, I built an association between coffee and intellectual work.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.600]   By the time I got to MIT, that got much worse.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.440]   The theory group at MIT is fueled by coffee.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.440]   They have these giant, uh, crafts and professional brewers.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.200]   The things you see in Starbucks, like the really big brewing
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.560]   machines up on a big stand.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:23.560]   And I was often tasked, I was the person who would brew it a lot of Pete's coffee.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.560]   I drink a lot of coffee at MIT.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.560]   And so that's just been a part of, I associate coffee with doing intellectual
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.000]   work.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.360]   Um, I do cut back.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.320]   So my philosophy is I don't drink after one 30 or so it is one 27.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.680]   So by the time we finished taping the show, that's why I literally, I have this
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.520]   with me because it'll be too late to drink coffee after taping the show is over.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.960]   I try not to drink after one or so, but I don't really limit what I do before then.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.960]   I probably drink a lot too much, but stopping at one seems to prevent it from
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.600]   really affecting my sleep right now.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.080]   So there we go.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.280]   Coffee is like a liquid manifestation of my type one ambition.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.400]   The type one piece of my ambition to reference the beginning of today's show.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.000]   That's sort of like, let's get things done.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.760]   It sort of manifested in my coffee.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.320]   I probably should drink like three cups max in the morning, be done with it.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.120]   I should do that.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.760]   I don't, but I honestly think the key to doing that is having it's it's it's all
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.280]   somatic.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.600]   I need a alternative ritual to associate with doing deep work.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.040]   I mean, that's, that's what this serves.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.040]   And so there we go.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.240]   That's everything you need to know, Aaron, about Cal and coffee.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.920]   You always drink it black, right?
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.680]   Oh, I used to get black.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.400]   Cause that's what I learned.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.440]   I like cheap flavored coffee because it's what I associate with being in that lecture
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.280]   hall at Princeton.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.440]   And, uh, you know, that was the first exposure to like, Oh, I see.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.480]   This is what college level.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.320]   And that's sort of a weed out class too.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.480]   It was like, okay, I see what like college level work is like, it's much more
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.440]   mathematically demanding.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.360]   It moves much faster.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.880]   So I just have these associations from that.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.760]   I have family members who are real coffee snobs and roast their beans and, you know,
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.480]   carefully extract one drop at a time from a, you know, a bag made out of the wings of
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.120]   a certain type of moth or whatever.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.200]   And for me, I was like, I don't care.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:16.280]   I'm drinking right now, Trader Joe's pumpkin spice, harvest, whatever holiday coffee.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.360]   I just associate that acidic cheapness with time to think.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.680]   And you never drink tea?
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.840]   I'll that's what I do when I need the deep work after
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.280]   one 30, I'll drink herbal tea.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.680]   Cause you get half the associations.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.040]   It's, it's bitter and it's hot and actually works pretty well.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.040]   That'll work pretty well.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.160]   You're probably way more, you're more controlled about nutrition.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.400]   What's your coffee philosophy?
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.280]   Um, no caffeine.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.480]   No, I drink coffee.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.280]   Wait, you had, you had a coffee cup when you came in here today.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:49.280]   I, I like to have cream with it, but ideally I would drink a black, but
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.600]   sometimes when I treat myself, I put cream in it and I was listening to someone
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.720]   somewhere, which is not a very useful description.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.280]   All I know is it was on a podcast and it was within the last month.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.640]   That's all I can locate it.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:07.000]   And he was saying, uh, like full fat cream and coffee is like much better.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.320]   Then butter or other types of things, because there's something about the way
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:21.480]   the fat is encapsulated in dairy that works well with the coffee and blah, blah,
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.680]   blah, metabolism, blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.080]   Something, something is like you get energy out of it and it
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.400]   doesn't just store the fat away.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.880]   But if you have other sources of fat and coffee, cause I guess the keto people or
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.960]   the, uh, paleo people put like butter in their coffee, actually, it's not so good
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.480]   like that it becomes, it's not as good.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.560]   Like that just gets sucked right into cells to be stored or something.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.520]   So he was a big proponent.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:48.760]   Whoever this guy was, some guy I heard some time on something was a really big
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:52.760]   believer in just like full cream, full fat cream, heavy cream, like is
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.200]   actually much better for you.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:54.880]   Got it.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.400]   Well, with that type of detail about who he is and his credentials, I don't see
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.760]   how you could not listen to this advice.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:04.240]   Some guy on something I heard at some time.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.920]   I think he ran a heavy cream factory.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.960]   All right, let's do one more question.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.400]   What do we got?
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   Okay.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.320]   Questions from K man.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.120]   Do you have any recommendations for my 16 year old son who is now reading your
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.760]   books and listening to your podcast?
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:22.960]   He would like to create multiple streams of income and enjoy a deeply satisfying life.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.280]   Let us know.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.080]   We'll be listening.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.800]   Well, I mean, first of all, good for your son.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:35.760]   They let that be the, the underlying piece of this answer is just to have someone at
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:41.680]   that age who is thinking so intentionally about their life is like a superpower.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:47.000]   When you're 35 and starting and thinking really intentional about your life, it's
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:47.960]   like, welcome to the club.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:51.040]   Like everyone at that point is starting to think through like, Oh, what works for me?
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.920]   What does it, how should I organize my efforts?
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.320]   What do I want to do at 16?
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.560]   Almost no one's doing that.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.600]   Or if you're doing that, they're doing it in a very simplistic formalism, like the
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.520]   millennial obsession with following your passion, like some notion of like, well,
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.720]   there's one job I'm meant to do.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.440]   And my job is to figure out what that is.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.560]   Very few people your age are thinking so systematically.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.680]   So that by itself is going to yield lots of benefits.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:17.360]   Irregardless of any particular advice I now give you going forward.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.840]   Now, uh, let me provide you, I took some notes on this.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.080]   I was looking at this question before.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.320]   So I'm going to try to provide some off relatively rough advice for you as someone
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:34.000]   who was young to lay a foundation of support of sorts that will support a deep
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.960]   life as you enter adulthood.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.960]   Now, the, the main thing I want to say to set up this foundation before we get to
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:47.640]   these specifics is be wary about getting too specific right now at your age at 16,
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:53.440]   about what your sort of post schooling adult life is going to be like in terms of
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.800]   specific sources of income, et cetera.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:00.600]   It's very difficult as a 16 year old, for example, to get 23, what your life's going
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.280]   to be like at 23 to get those details.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:02.520]   Right.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.680]   Cause you're not, you're not, you don't have knowledge yet of what you're going to be
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.080]   exposed to and what opportunities are going to be open to you.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.560]   So this is really the right time to be much more, um, laying a foundation for being
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.920]   able to take advantage of opportunities and build this lifestyle when the time
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.200]   comes, uh, as you enter adulthood.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.440]   So I would say, don't worry about the specifics yet.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.960]   Let's work on you right now to make you into a deep life generation machine so
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.960]   that you four or five years from now is going to be well suited to start
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.840]   crafting a really cool life.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.280]   So here's a few things I wrote down.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:41.240]   Number one, be 10 times more organized and intentional about your academic
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.680]   work than everyone else.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:48.080]   You know, most students are terrible at study strategies.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.480]   Most students are terrible at time management as a student.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.960]   If you are not, you can reduce the amount of time it requires for you to perform
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.560]   your schoolwork a certain level by a factor of three or four.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:02.000]   It really is almost like a magic trick.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.520]   I learned this from experience.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:10.320]   You start treating your student life like a job, like a 35 year old would treat their
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.800]   job and it becomes significantly easier.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.320]   It's footprint on your life becomes significantly easier.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.880]   The amount of stress it causes will reduce down to very little and you will be able
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:25.800]   to perform academically at the very height of your potential without grinding it out,
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.160]   without overloading or overburdening yourself.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.320]   So, you know, I wrote a book about this, How to Become a Straight A Student.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.680]   That's for college kids.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.760]   I wrote another book called How to Be a High School Superstar.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:42.840]   If you look at the part one playbook for that book, I adapt a lot of those study
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.640]   and time management advice from college to the high school context.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.200]   So you might find value in both of those.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.800]   So the Straight A Student book and the part one playbook from How to Become a High
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.200]   School Superstar. The story I always tell is I was a reasonable student my first year
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.440]   of college. At the end of the first year of college, I got serious about my academic
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.800]   strategies.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.400]   I started treating the problem of how do you do well as a student like a entrepreneur
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.600]   would treat the problem of how do I learn how to market?
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.960]   How do I find a new audience?
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.040]   Because I'd run a business, I was used to that way of thinking.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:23.120]   I brought that way of thinking to my academic work and I jumped from a good student, B
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.200]   plus, A minus student to four O's starting my sophomore fall every single quarter till
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.720]   I graduated, except for one A minus in my senior spring.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.120]   Ended up graduating with a three point nine five GPA.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.320]   If I had done this one quarter earlier, I probably would have been the valedictorian of
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.120]   my class at Dartmouth.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:45.720]   I did not get smarter between the summer of my freshman year, my sophomore year.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:51.160]   What made me unique is I was one of the only people on that campus to start experimenting
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.960]   with what's the right way to take notes, what's the right way to study for a math test,
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.960]   what's the right way to study for an art history test.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.240]   How can I manage my time so I don't have to ever work past 8 p.m.?
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.200]   It was much easier than you would think.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.240]   All right. So be 10 times more organized and intentional about your academic work.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.160]   Number two, introduce some discipline into your life.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.440]   So you get used to the idea of having a disciplined life.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.520]   There's things that are important but hard, and you're willing to do that work over
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.760]   time and see the results in the long term.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.480]   You probably should have some sort of physical discipline, so some sort of sports or
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:28.120]   training, something that you do that will put you in better health or shape than just
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.680]   sort of the average person you know who's not a serious athlete.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.520]   You should have some sort of mental discipline in there built around the reading of
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.960]   hard physical books.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.200]   I'd probably recommend that above all else for someone your age, that you have some sort
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.920]   of systematic program of study involving real books that you read, you have set times
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:51.240]   you put aside. Have two or three things like this just so you have a self-image of
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.200]   someone who is disciplined.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   And again, the details don't matter because you just need to when the time comes, you
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.120]   know, when you're 24 or whatever, the time comes for your discipline is going to unlock
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.600]   something awesome. You want to already have that tool sharpened.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:13.000]   All right, number three, be very wary of video games, of social media, your time is very
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   valuable right now.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.400]   Because you get leverage, interesting moves or developments or opportunities you unlock
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.920]   when you're young, have the maximum amount of time to actually earn experiential interest
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.440]   and start generating really cool things.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.560]   So don't waste your teenage years, your early 20s, your college years.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.320]   Don't waste 40 percent of your discretionary time in call of duty.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.120]   Don't waste 40 percent of your time on TikTok.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:44.800]   Maybe that's OK for some people, but I can tell right now that this is a kid who is
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.480]   awesome at it, he's on it, he's listening to deep questions, he's reading my books, he's
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.920]   intentional, he's already thinking about multiple income streams.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.080]   So be very wary of those devices.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.880]   Be the guy who's weird about like, yeah, I just don't really use my phone.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.080]   Let that be your thing.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:04.640]   All right, number four, expose yourself to bulk positive randomness.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.800]   That's a term that comes from my longtime friend, Ben Casanoka, who wrote about that
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.880]   in his memoir of being a teenage entrepreneur prodigy.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:20.120]   So like starting companies as teenage years, the startup of you is what that book is
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.040]   called. And he talks about this a lot.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.640]   Expose yourself to lots of interesting stuff all the time to see what clicks, what
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:30.560]   sticks, what ends up resonating and holding your attention the next day or the next
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.640]   week. Go hear speakers read interesting things, go to interesting documentaries, go to
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.480]   conventions. You know, expose yourself to bulk positive randomness.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:45.040]   This is how you get eventually something really interesting clicking in your life.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.120]   And now to pull from my book, How to Become a High School Superstar.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.720]   Once there is something that catches your attention.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:58.000]   That you're pursuing, you want to pursue what I call the failed simulation effect,
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.840]   which is you want to get to a place where that activity, if you're a young person.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.240]   Where people say, I have no idea how he did that and the way you generate that effect,
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:10.280]   which is incredibly powerful and opens up all these interesting opportunities, is you
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.400]   just keep leveraging up.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   You do one thing that's kind of explainable.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.760]   You use that to get access to the next thing.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.920]   You use that to get access to the third thing.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.640]   That third thing you use access to get to the fourth thing.
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.040]   And by the time you get to that fourth thing, that might be interviewing Supreme Court
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.320]   justices for my podcast as a 17 year old.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.800]   That thing seems like I have no idea how a 17 year old does that.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:35.440]   But if you look the three steps before that started with you being exposed to a court
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:40.880]   reporter for the at a whatever, an internship, yes, the path makes sense.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.600]   But not when you see the final thing.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.360]   Maybe that's a confusing explanation.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.920]   I have a whole chapter about this in my book.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:51.760]   I also wrote about this, interestingly enough, for Tim Ferriss's blog.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.680]   Way back in the day when I first met Tim.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:57.200]   So it's on there somewhere.
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:01.360]   We're talking 2007, 2008, probably.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:09.080]   I wrote an article for Tim Dot blog back when that was his main online platform about
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.240]   the failed simulation effect.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.440]   So you can actually find my article on his blog.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.360]   I probably just search for my name and Tim Dot blog or something like that.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.920]   But anyways, you expose yourself to interesting stuff.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.440]   When something clicks, you keep going, keep going, keep going.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:24.360]   The first six months you're working on something, it's interesting to you, but not to
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.160]   the outside world.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.040]   You get to a year plus six months and you might be at a place now with that interest
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.720]   where people have no idea how you did that at your age.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.800]   And that's when really cool opportunities open up.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.000]   Number five.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.880]   Steady character and leadership.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:45.880]   Expose yourself to examples of people who live with great character, who act as great
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:52.240]   leaders, even during difficult times, read biographies, read profiles, watch
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:57.640]   documentaries, maybe if they have a social media presence, so maybe like a Jocko Willink
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:02.520]   type, if that resonates, maybe you're listening to his podcast and the military
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.800]   professionals he has on the Tales of Valor, whatever it is that resonates, you want to
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:15.600]   be imprinting young, a real affiliation or affinity for character and leadership,
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.960]   especially during difficult times.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:21.800]   That is going to be a North Star or a guiding light through all sorts of different
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   ups and downs and competing pressures and diversions you're going to experience the
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.640]   next, let's say 10 years of your life.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.840]   Now's the time to start building up those examples.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.800]   And number six, serve people one way or the other, be doing that now.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.640]   And it's just setting the habit of, and it could just be volunteering.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.600]   It could be this is this cause or online.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:43.960]   I go and I help, I'm in this community just to help these people, whatever it is.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:50.440]   You also want that imprinted into your soul at a young age that serve other people,
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:54.920]   because that's what you need to fall back on when the other pursuit you have isn't
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:57.480]   going well, this company failed and I lost this job.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.320]   And I really am feeling down on myself because I had these ambitions that I was
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.280]   going to be Michael Crichton at 27.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.520]   And instead I'm at, you know, I'm getting to that age and, and, uh, I'm short on
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.200]   money and my, my plans didn't work.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.520]   You fall back on helping others.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.760]   Well, you know what, let me just put that energy to helping others while I also am
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.800]   trying to figure myself out.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.320]   The more you can fall back on how can I serve or help other people, the more.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:23.200]   Uh, emotional and psychological resilience you're going to have for all the ups and
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.560]   downs that are going to come.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:30.360]   It's what's going to prevent you from ending up instead 26 and bitter and on
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:37.840]   Twitter and just mad and yelling at people and, uh, medicated seven ways to
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:40.240]   Sunday and just not even sure what to do with your life.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:43.680]   You'll end up maybe like a, you know, an ideological groupie for some weird,
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.640]   whatever, and just be miserable.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.280]   You don't want to be there.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.280]   So falling back on serving others as a default is that buffer is that
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.680]   protection, be useful to the world, be useful to others.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.920]   Let that also be a guiding light.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.120]   All right.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.720]   So those are my six pieces of advice, but good for you for thinking about
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:03.600]   this stuff at such a young age, you do these things, you're going to be a rock
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:03.760]   star.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.960]   You're gonna be a rock star in college.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:07.560]   You're going to come out of college and be living a life that you are going to
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:11.080]   have a full control on the reins of this life.
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:15.280]   And when you start doing lifestyle centric career planning seriously, but you
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:18.480]   know, you really should wait till a little bit later in college to do so.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:22.040]   You are going to have options and whatever comes out of those initial lifestyle
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.320]   centric career planning exercises, you're going to be able to shape your life there
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.680]   of a deep life and a useful life.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.400]   So I'm glad you asked that question.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.360]   That's my advice.
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.280]   And that is also all the time we have.
