[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.440]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.120]   And finally, at long last, two and a half years later, the book Buy This, Not That,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.280]   How to Spend Your Way to Wealth and Freedom is out.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   Hooray!
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.280]   Woohoo!
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.560]   So I have with me my wife, Sini, who has been with me on this journey since the very beginning.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.640]   She has edited and reviewed the book multiple times.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.040]   How many times would you say you have read the book?
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.160]   We went through it about four different times during the whole process.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.560]   Right, four different times, and it's a 300-page book, about 110,000 words.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.480]   So it was a long, long process, but I truly believe Buy This, Not That will be the best
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   personal finance book anybody can ever read.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.480]   What do you think?
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   Oh, totally.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   It is.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.840]   It's an incredible feat and accomplishment that you have put together.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840]   We have put together.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.200]   Well, you did, obviously, the bulk of the work with all the writing.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.080]   And I'm glad I was able to contribute to helping with the editing process and fact-checking
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.300]   and looking at numbers and formulas and all that stuff throughout the book.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.160]   It was an incredible learning experience.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.720]   I know you definitely feel the same.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.720]   And congratulations.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720]   Made it!
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.720]   We made it.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.720]   Woohoo!
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.720]   And here's something interesting, folks.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.880]   We went through so many revisions.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.760]   I would say a couple dozen revisions, and each revision was more polishing, getting
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.840]   better, more inclusive, thinking about new ideas, thinking about things we missed.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.120]   And despite all the editing, all the grammatical error changes, the formula fixing and all
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.120]   that, there are still some errors in the first edition of Buy This, Not That.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.920]   Yes, it's true indeed.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.320]   It was crazy because I was, you know, after I sent my last pass, which is supposed to
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.040]   be the last, last pass where we don't get anything back, it goes to the copy editors,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.100]   they polish it some more.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.000]   About a month later, I was like, "You know what?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.880]   I'm going to go read the book again in the hot tub."
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.640]   And I was reading the book, and I was like, "Wait a minute.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.760]   What's up with this spelling error?"
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.600]   And the spelling error was made four times in four subtitles.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.760]   You may or may not find it.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.920]   And I was totally bummed.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.160]   I was like, "What was the point of spending dozens of hours?"
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   I know.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   It's tough.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   It's tough.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   And it's hard when there's so many people involved.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.200]   And publishers have a system, a way that they do things for a good reason.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.680]   You know, they've been doing it for decades and decades.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.280]   And it was a new process to us, and we sent through, you know, a lot of fine-tuning in
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   the last time that we touched the book.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.120]   And there were some changes that happened between that time and when it actually went
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.120]   to print.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.800]   And we didn't get to see the final final before it went to print.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.520]   And somewhere along the line, there were some goofs that happened in that last bit.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.360]   And it's just what happens.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.600]   It seems to be very common with any book that goes to print.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.040]   So true to Financial Samurai fashion, we always look at silver linings.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.720]   Silver linings, when bad things happen, we think, "Ah, thank God I didn't break my ankle
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.920]   when I sprained my ankle.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.720]   Thank God I didn't drive off a cliff and I just blew a tire."
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.640]   You know, just think about the positives.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.280]   And the one positive that I thought, it's actually a huge positive because I've been
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.840]   a collector of awesome things like Chinese coins, baseball cards, comics, and rare books,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.720]   is that a first edition book that becomes a bestseller, which I believe Buy This, Not
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.240]   That, will become – it's actually already an Amazon number one bestseller in the retirement
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.800]   planning category.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:02.280]   But first edition bestsellers with errors actually are more valuable on the secondary
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   collector's market.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   I mean, there's this one – I was doing some research for this post and it was called
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.240]   like the Upside Down Jenny Stamp.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.480]   It was like an old plain.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.840]   It was just printed upside down and it sold for over a million dollars.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.760]   It's a classic collectible that's known for being printed funny.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.040]   So Buy This, Not That first edition has just a small spelling error but it is still an
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.560]   error so I will embrace it.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.640]   And I think less than – maybe about 15,000 first edition copies will be sold in the United
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.000]   States.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.400]   And what I'm going to do is I'm going to sign and have a special stamp.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   Nobody else has this stamp.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.280]   I'm going to have this special stamp and I'm going to sign and special stamp less
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.840]   than 300 copies.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.760]   So it's kind of going to be like the golden ticket in the Willy Wonka factory where if
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.520]   you can get your hands on one of this signed and special stamped version, it could be worth
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.200]   a lot of money in the future.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   Who knows?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   All right.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.040]   So writing and editing a book over two years is one level of hardness.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.760]   I would say it's, I don't know, 10 out of 10 in terms of level of hardness.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.280]   How would you – what would you think?
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.840]   How hard is it to write a book you think?
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.800]   Well, I didn't do the writing so I would – I can't give a complete answer but based
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.360]   on the amount of work that you spent writing, I would say definitely 10 out of 10.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.600]   The editing process was intense to say the least just due to the volume.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.280]   The back and forth, literally probably a thousand plus emails.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.080]   There were a lot of questions that we were answering back and forth.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.200]   It wasn't just me doing the editing.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   Obviously, there's a whole team at Portfolio that was doing it.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   I was just assisting and it's an intense process to edit an entire book.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.960]   It really is.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.480]   But you know what's funny?
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.280]   The marketing, the marketing of the book is even maybe more intense.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   Different type of intense.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.080]   It's actually – it's really difficult, folks.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.160]   So I started marketing Buy This, Not That three and a half months before July 19th,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.360]   the release date.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.200]   What happens is you put your hopes and dreams of the book, everything you have into this
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   book, you think it's the best thing you've ever created and it's been polished and
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.480]   looked over dozens of times by five, six people, right?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.680]   And then so because you have worked so hard and you believe so much in the book, you want
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.800]   everybody to read it and therefore you believe with all your heart that other people should
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.960]   help promote it, right?
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.800]   But the problem is people will say no and it's those no's that I was reminded over
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   and over again.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.400]   It was either no, I'm not interested in marketing your book or just no response.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.800]   That kind of bummed me out for a while.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.680]   Yeah, it's definitely hard to feel like you're – when you're reaching out about
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.040]   something you're so excited about and then you get nothing back.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.240]   Like nothing, black hole of darkness.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.280]   It's pretty rough.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.960]   And so it's an expectations game where you think some people will help you but then they
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.520]   end up just ghosting you or saying nothing.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.400]   And these are the people you've helped before in the past.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.840]   I've allowed them to do a guest post on Financial Samurai and help them build their
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.720]   traffic and their brand and then nothing.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   It was just a rejection.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.560]   So that was pretty disappointing and that reminded me one of the reasons why I left
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.320]   the finance world.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   In any job that pays well, a lot of it has to do with selling.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.880]   You have to sell your company's product.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.560]   You have to sell yourself and you would just get no's or ignores, I would say most of
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.840]   the time.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:01.120]   But if you have a 10% hit rate, that means you better ask 10 people before you get a
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.640]   success otherwise you're not going to make it.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.600]   And so this whole marketing process of the book has really reminded me why I left my
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   day job and why I actually don't want to go back.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.220]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.480]   The other interesting thing I learned is how to deal with anxiety.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:27.400]   So I now firmly know why people don't try to do hard things or to create anything new.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.600]   And the reason why is you put your heart into it, people say no, people reject you, they
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:40.000]   don't return your emails and calls and whatever you do create turns out to be a big flop.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.700]   And so for a while, one of the funny things is I talk to a lot of editors who have edited
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   my work.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.380]   I've talked to you, I've talked to my father, I've talked to other people who have great
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.260]   grammatical and editing skills.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.900]   Make me feel like English is a second language, I guess that's how you write it.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:08.580]   And I always ask the editors with such great editing ability, why not create some amazing
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.460]   prose of your own?
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.980]   Yeah, we've had this conversation before.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:18.260]   And my take is that they're two very different skills.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.820]   I do enjoy writing and I have written a couple posts, well, not a couple, more than a couple
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.220]   on your site.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.260]   And for me, my challenge is speed.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.960]   It takes me a really, really long time to put together an article.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.380]   I enjoy it, it's just not my strength in terms of efficiency.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.020]   But I have a realization here.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.300]   Go slow to go far.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.500]   Speed is overrated.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.300]   You don't need speed to write unless you're like a production factory, like you're on
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.980]   a deadline, you work for a newspaper or whatever, right?
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.460]   This is Financial Samurai, we do whatever we want.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.460]   Right.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.900]   There comes a point where maybe it takes too long.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:09.100]   And if you look at word count, for example, let's say it takes you an hour and a half
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.260]   to write an article.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.220]   If I were to try and write something of that same length on the same or similar type of
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:23.140]   topic, it might take me anywhere between five to eight hours, you know, significant amount
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.140]   more.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.140]   Right.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.540]   Whereas, you know, maybe I could have put those hours towards something else that I
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.460]   am faster at doing.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.460]   More efficient, yeah.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.460]   Right.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.220]   Because unfortunately, we all have a limited amount of time.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:43.340]   And given we're parents of a five-year-old and a two-year-old, you know, you're not sleeping
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.980]   much, I'm sleeping okay, thanks to you.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.500]   But you know, opportunity cost.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.940]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.020]   And you know, Buy This, Not That is about opportunity cost at the end of the day because
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.780]   we're trying to choose between two decisions, the most optimal decision and to avoid those
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.980]   suboptimal decisions.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.820]   But I would say give yourself more credit.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.060]   You've had a lot of posts on Financial Samurai do really well, really connect with other
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.660]   people and, you know, again, speed.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.060]   Yeah, that is the funny thing.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.540]   It's like we only have so much time.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.700]   And so we better utilize our time the best way we can.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:26.460]   Yeah, and I think, you know, in terms of editing, I'm obviously not a professional editor, but
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.980]   it's something that I do enjoy.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.580]   It's something that I can do fairly quickly, especially in comparison to writing.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.060]   And I'm a detail-oriented person, so I like catching the little things.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.060]   Right.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.060]   And you're good at it.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.740]   After, you know, as a writer, after you write something, a lot of these errors just fly
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.700]   through your – fly over your head, fly over my head.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.780]   I just can't see it because I've written it and read it so many times.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.280]   So back to the topic of anxiety.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:03.300]   For the past three months marketing the book, I have felt this consistent low level of anxiety.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.380]   And it's kind of annoying, actually, and it's kind of weird because I'm generally not an
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.700]   anxious person.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.700]   I'm pretty happy-go-lucky.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:17.680]   I like going to battle in USTA tennis because I like the feeling, the nervousness, the adrenaline
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680]   and all that.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680]   Win or lose.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.500]   I mean, obviously, I'm bummed when I lose.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.020]   But now, you know, as an older guy now, I'm like, "Oh, whatever if I lose."
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.260]   And it also doesn't last that long, right?
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.540]   You have some anticipation up till the match.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.680]   Then the match is done in several hours.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.780]   It's not taking months after months.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.780]   Yes.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.780]   That's a great point.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.900]   From start to finish.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.420]   It's a different timeline.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.420]   That's a great point.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.420]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.660]   Like, the anxiety before a match will last a couple days before.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.540]   Anxiety right before the match, definitely a warm-up.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.060]   And then during the match, I kind of have an out-of-body experience sometimes where
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.660]   I'm just like, "Am I really playing this?
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.660]   This is really cool.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.660]   This is fun."
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.660]   And then hopefully I win.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.500]   I had an 83% win percentage this year.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.300]   Went like 19-4.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.860]   That was pretty sweet.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.860]   Showed up.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.460]   But with the book, man, it's like-
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.940]   It's a long process.
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.940]   Three months.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.140]   It's like a three-month anticipation of the match where you're just working hard, reaching
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.500]   out to people, calling local bookstores, "Hey, do you have Buy This, Not That available this
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.500]   week?"
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   "No."
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   "Oh, why not?
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.500]   I'm a local author.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.500]   Do you want to support local author?"
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:32.540]   Well, you also had marketing on your mind even before we finished the editing process.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.940]   Just kind of lurking in the back of your mind knowing that it was coming.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.420]   It was coming.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.900]   I tried my best over these three months to not make Financial Samurai and the podcast
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.300]   all about Buy This, Not That.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.260]   I know everything is free, right?
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.220]   So I can do whatever I want.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.100]   But I also wanted to have a balance where I would continue to provide value in the newsletter,
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.580]   in the posts, and in the podcasts.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:03.300]   But at the end of the day, this is maybe a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.340]   I don't know whether I want to write another book, which will make the first edition of
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.900]   Buy This, Not That more valuable with the air.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.860]   And so I just have to make it count when it counts the most.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:21.500]   But I will share with you how I have dealt with this anxiety of this book launch and
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.180]   the worry of whether everything will go smoothly if you're trying to do something hard or if
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.460]   you're trying to be creative.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.980]   So the first thing I did was focus on a process.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.120]   I came up with a game plan, a marketing game plan, and I followed it.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.860]   Every week I would write a post that related to Buy This, Not That.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.460]   Every week I would release a podcast episode that would be related to Buy This, Not That.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:51.860]   And I would have a list of people, blogs, media outlets that I would contact, and I
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.860]   would just go through it.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.380]   That was one, just having a plan.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.500]   Two was setting proper expectations.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:05.340]   For example, the Financial Samurai newsletter at financialsamurai.com/newsletter has about
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.780]   50,000 subscribers.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:13.580]   So that sounds pretty good, but it's actually not that big based on when I started in 2009.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.500]   And I told myself, well, I did some research and I know this, that the average conversion
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.460]   rate for someone to buy anything from your newsletter is about 2-3%.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:32.700]   So you could take 2-3% times 50,000 is 1,000-1,500 buyers of Buy This, Not That the book.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.020]   And so I set those expectations as a goal.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:42.660]   Okay, if I'm the average, then maybe I'll be able to sell 1,000-1,500 copies, hard copies.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.740]   And then that is the hurdle.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.420]   That's the realistic expectation.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.660]   And if I am over that, and I'm glad to say I'm over that, then it's like, okay, you're
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.820]   doing your job and you're doing better than the average.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:00.260]   Another way to deal with anxiety is to just say, you are doing the best you can with what
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.900]   you have.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.260]   Always tell yourself you're doing the best you can with what you have.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.140]   And what will happen is you'll end up working harder, thinking about more things, leaving
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:18.900]   no stone unturned so that when your product is finally out, you won't have any regret
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.860]   having not tried your best.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.800]   Another strategy for reducing anxiety and just keeping the motivation going is to diversify
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.160]   your activities.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:34.260]   So I have been writing, waking up at 5 a.m., 6 a.m. to write for a couple hours, you know,
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.300]   for a couple years now.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.380]   And it was my necessity because the kids would wake up by 8 and I just can't concentrate
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.940]   with them all screaming and wanting to play.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.900]   And so I diversified my activities through physical activity, namely tennis and softball,
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.500]   talking to other people in different industries who have different interests.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.520]   And this was really, really helpful for mental health.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.100]   And the final thing I did to manage my anxiety was to put things in perspective.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.820]   Ten years ago, I tried to get a literary agent.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.700]   I reached out to at least a dozen and I got rejected or no word from anybody.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.780]   But I said, screw that.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.060]   I'm not going to take the rejection sitting down.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.940]   And you and I created an e-book called How to Engineer Your Layoff.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.860]   And my dad helped edit it.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.420]   And it's in its fifth edition now.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.360]   And since the e-book was published in 2012, it has been purchased and read by thousands
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:36.520]   of people and it has generated over $500,000 in net profits.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   And that's great.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.020]   That's like $50,000 on average a year.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.880]   I mean, that's almost livable income for us in San Francisco.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.340]   And so to count your wins, even though you get rejected, is a good thing.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.000]   And also to look at the perspective and say, well, I have this book.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.120]   If it becomes a bestseller or not, it's okay.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.240]   Because I was able to get a book deal with a reputable, one of the best imprints in the
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.760]   nonfiction space, which is Portfolio Penguin Random House.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.780]   I couldn't even get a literary agent.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:14.580]   Now I was able to skip the literary agent and go straight to the top with a great publisher.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:20.200]   And so I just want to feel proud of the work that I've done and whether it becomes a
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.520]   nationwide bestseller or not is less important than being able to get the work done and not
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:32.080]   quitting, not quitting during a pandemic with two kids.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:38.340]   I mean, when we look back, our kids are going to ask, so how was life like during the pandemic?
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.380]   And I'm going to say, it was tough.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.560]   We worried about you constantly, but we provided as much love and care as possible.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.920]   And we created this book that you could be proud of.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.400]   I mean, you really did not waste a minute in the last two and a half years.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.520]   I mean, and it's about defiance.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.800]   You've encountered something bad and you can take it sitting down or you can say, you know
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.360]   what, screw this bad situation.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.120]   I'm going to make the most out of this situation.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.780]   So when we got married in 2008, it was the global financial crisis right in the heart
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.780]   of it.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.320]   I was like losing lots of money.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   We're worried about our jobs.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.680]   We're like, hey, you know what?
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.760]   All I remember from December 2008 was our beach wedding.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.520]   It was like 16 people, cameras.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.160]   You had your white Target dress.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:41.960]   I had my Aloha swap meet shirt that cost like several dollars and our flip flops.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.240]   And it was a simple life, but it was really good memories.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.840]   And so this defiance about not letting a bad situation or a nervous nerve wracking situation
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.100]   get you down is the financial samurai way.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:01.080]   And I hope everybody takes that into consideration and helps cultivate their own defiance.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.640]   All right.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.480]   Well, it's getting late in the episode here, but the final thing I want to talk about is
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.080]   embracing one's underdog status.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.640]   So I believe we're an underdog.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.280]   We don't work for a large media publication.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.040]   We're not huge on social media.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   We're not out there, but we can still fight to create an amazing book with the resources
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.120]   we have.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.340]   And we can still fight to make Buy This, Not That a bestseller.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.880]   And you and I know we've known each other for so long, right?
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.400]   Since what, 1998?
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.800]   And I think you have felt you've been an underdog as well.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.400]   Yeah, I'd say so.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:52.840]   So what are the things that make you keep on going no matter what?
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.000]   Well, competition helped me when I was younger.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:07.200]   I had some rivals in my day, nothing serious, but wanting to do better and have that sense
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.600]   of competition helped keep me going, and also just wanting to be independent.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.920]   I didn't come from a lot.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.100]   And my parents had a lot of struggles, and I knew that they wouldn't be able to comfortably
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.720]   support me.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.800]   So I knew that I needed to study hard, and I knew I needed to get a job that I could
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:33.360]   count on that would give me a steady paycheck that would provide opportunity for me to succeed
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.520]   and do well and learn and grow through my career.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.640]   And that really, really got me going in my younger years, and it just continued to give
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:52.420]   me the fuel and motivation to make them proud, make myself proud, make you proud, and build
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.520]   our life together as a family.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:00.400]   Yeah, there's a saying that it's an internal motor that I have, and that's, "Why give up
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.480]   when you can keep on going?"
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.360]   Why give up?
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   No way.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.280]   Don't give up when you can keep on going.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.120]   And I think since our children came in 2017, it's just added more motivation to keep on
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.740]   going because not only do we want to provide for our children as any parent would, we also
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.440]   want to make them proud.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.540]   We want to protect them.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.020]   We want to nurture them and educate them.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.660]   So it's been a great, great journey, folks, and thank you so much for supporting Financial
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:35.360]   Samurai and picking up a hard copy or an audio copy or digital copy of Buy This, Not That.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:43.680]   You can buy it at any bookstore you'd like, or you can go to financialsamurai.com/btnt.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.080]   I'm really excited about one thing over the next couple of weeks, and you know what that
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   is?
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   No.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   Yes, you do.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   Okay.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.080]   Wait.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   I don't know.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.660]   That one thing, oh my gosh, I am so excited.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.000]   This is the most excited I've been in a while.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.040]   And that is to pick up our son from school and go to the bookstore.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.320]   We're going to do a treasure hunt for the book, and we're just going to have so much
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.720]   fun and we're going to find it and we're going to talk about it.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.560]   We're going to take some pictures.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.960]   So if you want to support your local bookstore, which I definitely will be, go to your local
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   bookstore and ask if they have a copy of Buy This, Not That.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.280]   Barnes & Noble should have one, but that's like the big conglomerate.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.800]   Those are indie bookstores.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:33.120]   They might not have a copy, but you can always order one as well to support and just tell
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.480]   them you'd love to get more copies in.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.720]   That'd be great for us and it'd be great for everybody.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.080]   So again, thank you so much for supporting us and we will talk to you later.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:44.880]   Thanks, everybody.
