[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060]   Now we continue this evening, you remember, with our consideration of the biblical doctrine
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.100]   of redemption or the biblical doctrine of salvation. We reminded one another last week
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:22.120]   that man, having failed to keep God's law and commandment, had fallen and had become
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.840]   the slave of Satan and dead in trespasses and in sins, and that had he been left to
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.000]   himself, his condition would have been entirely hopeless. But God, in his infinite grace and
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   love and mercy, had looked upon man in pity and had informed him of this great plan and
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.600]   purpose of salvation and of redemption. And last Friday evening we considered the characters
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.320]   and characteristics of this great plan of redemption in general. I ended by saying that
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:06.160]   God had revealed this plan of redemption and of salvation to men in the form of a covenant
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.600]   that he had made with men. And this is commonly called the covenant of redemption or the covenant
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.200]   of salvation. And that is to be our special theme this evening. The way in which God has
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:33.120]   made known to men and has revealed to men this gracious purpose to save men from his
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.040]   guilt and from his pollution, which have resulted from men's listening to the suggestion of
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.360]   Satan and thereby leading to the fall. Now, the great word we've got to consider tonight
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.600]   is this word covenant. You've noticed that God used it in his speaking to Abram, as we
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.800]   found it there in the seventeenth chapter of the book of Genesis. What is a covenant?
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:15.000]   Well, a covenant can be defined as an agreement or a pact which is entered into by two parties,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.280]   the two parties being more or less on an equal footing. That is the normal customary definition
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.520]   of a covenant. You can make a covenant today. People do make covenants. They make covenants
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.320]   with respect to giving gifts towards good causes. There's such a thing as the covenant
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.340]   of the League of Nations, the covenant of the United Nations. It means an agreement
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.880]   or a pact entered into by two parties, which normally and generally are more or less on
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.440]   an equal footing and of an equal standing. A covenant is generally confirmed by some
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   kind of solemn ceremony, as in the presence of God. You either take an oath or there is
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.980]   a religious service or something to that effect. It is confirmed in some shape or form in this
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.160]   most solemn way in the presence of God. And in the covenant each party, of course, binds
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:29.840]   himself to the fulfillment of certain promises on the basis of certain conditions. That's
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.420]   a good, rough, and ready definition of a covenant.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.500]   But obviously when you come to speak of a covenant between God and men, you have to
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.140]   realize that there are certain modifications of that customary idea of the word covenant.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.560]   Now in the Bible you will find covenants made between men. David and Jonathan, you remember,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.380]   made a covenant, and they were doing it on this basis of equality. But when you come
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:08.900]   to God and men, clearly there is of necessity a difference. And this difference appears,
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.660]   especially in the authorized version of the Bible, in this way, that the word is sometimes
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.120]   translated as testament and not as covenant. So you find out talking about the Old Testament
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.160]   and the New Testament. And in other places you will find the word testament. You will
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.360]   find it, for instance, in the second epistle to the Corinthians and in the third chapter.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.080]   Now it is generally agreed that this word, which stands for this idea, should always
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:52.920]   be translated as covenant, except in one instance. And the one exception is Hebrews 9, verses
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:02.240]   16 and 17, where clearly it must be translated as testament, for it refers to a person dying
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.880]   and, as it were, making a will. It is his last will and testament. But apart from that
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   one instance, in Hebrews 9, verses 16 and 17, you will find that the other translations,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.640]   this much-advertised, revised, standard version, does translate it always as covenant, rather
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.200]   than as testament, except in this one instance. But in the authorized version, you will find
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.180]   testament sometimes, covenant at other times. Now I am referring to that for this reason.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.080]   The translators of the authorized version had a very definite object in view when they
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.880]   used this word testament. They did so, of course, to emphasize the priority of God.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.800]   When God makes a covenant with men, it is not two equal partners meeting; it is God
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.440]   giving, as it were, his covenant to men. So they thought, well, now that is more like
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.280]   a testament than a covenant. So they chose to use the word testament. Strictly speaking,
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.680]   they were wrong in doing so, but they certainly did emphasize this idea of the priority of
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.480]   God, as over against men as an equal. They did it also, of course, because they could
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.880]   see very clearly that in that case, in Hebrews 9, it is a testament. And as it can be argued
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.360]   that ultimately all the blessings that do come to us under God's covenant of grace
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.080]   with men come as the result of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, there is a sense in
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.960]   which we do inherit everything as the result of his last testament. So there was that much
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.260]   ad inerit to be said for them. And then, no doubt, they were partly influenced by the
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:59.040]   fact that the Latin word for all this is testimonium, and they were dependent partly upon the Latin
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.000]   translations of the scriptures. However, the thing, then, that we must keep
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.860]   in mind is that the priority of God is to be emphasized. It is a gift from God which
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.600]   has been ushered in by the death of Christ, and because it comes from God, it is something
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:27.080]   which is certain and inviolable and unbreakable. And yet we must hold on to this idea of a
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:35.280]   covenant because God, in his wonderful love and grace and condescension, has chosen to
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.680]   reveal his purposes in this particular way. He calls men to him, and he chooses to make
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.640]   an agreement with men. God need not have done that, but he has done so, in spite of men's
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.120]   rebellion and his sin and his arrogance. God, as it were, has called him in and has said,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.440]   I want to make an agreement with you. There is nothing, therefore, in a way, that so displays
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.720]   the wonderful love and grace and kindness and condescension of God so much as this teaching
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.960]   in the Bible with regard to his making covenants with men.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:21.360]   Now, we have already seen that God originally made a covenant with Adam. You remember that
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.800]   he put him in the garden, and he told him that if he did certain things, he would have
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:34.200]   a certain reward. Now, that is called the covenant of works, because Adam's inheritance
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:41.360]   of this promise God made to him was entirely dependent upon his works, upon what he did.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:48.680]   But you remember we have seen that Adam broke the covenant. He failed and landed himself
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.640]   and his posterity in the terrible plight that we have been describing.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:03.880]   Now, from there on, God has made a new covenant, and it is this covenant of grace. Clearly
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.600]   God could not make another covenant of works with men. If men, in an ideal position and
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.200]   while perfect, could not keep the covenant of works, what is the object of making another
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.680]   covenant of works with men? It is clearly impossible by definition. And the Bible tells
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.720]   us that God has not made another covenant of works, but he has made what is called this
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:39.080]   covenant of grace. And yet, in the covenant of grace, God has introduced certain conditions.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:46.880]   He has made his promises. He has told us what he is making possible for us. But he does
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.480]   make a demand upon us. He tells us that we are only going to receive and enjoy these
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:00.080]   promises on certain conditions, and that is the condition of faith. And man has to accept
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:09.040]   these conditions voluntarily before he will enjoy the blessings. But furthermore, God
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.040]   has also told us in the covenant of grace that he himself is going to do something which
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.440]   makes it possible for us to derive these benefits. And that is why it is called the covenant
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.800]   of grace. Now then, let me divide that up a little.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.760]   God, I say, has made certain promises. What is the great central promise that God has
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:41.560]   made to men in the covenant of grace? Well, you know, it really can be put in this way.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:48.880]   He has promised to be a God unto men. That is the great promise, "I will be a God unto
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:57.240]   thee." Now, you see the importance and the significance of this. God had been the God
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:06.080]   of Adam, but here Adam sins against him and falls, becomes the slave of Satan, breaks
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.480]   the connection with God. And the remarkable and astounding thing is that God turns to
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.120]   men and assures them in the covenant of grace that he is going to find a way, that he has
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:25.320]   a way, whereby he can still be a God to men. "I will be to thee a God, and they shall
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.360]   be to me a people." Now, make a note of that, because as you go
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.160]   through your scriptures, you will find that that is the great promise that is repeated
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.760]   time and time and time again. You will find it in Jeremiah 31. You will find it again
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:49.560]   in Jeremiah 32. You will find it in Ezekiel 34 and 36. You will find it in 2 Corinthians
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:57.200]   6. You will find it in Hebrews 8 and in verse 10. And in a most marvelous way, in Revelations
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:06.760]   21 and the third verse, you read this, "The tabernacle of God is with men, and he will
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:14.600]   dwell with them." That is in the final state. So you see that that is the very essence of
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:21.760]   God's promise to men in the covenant of grace, that what had become broken by sin in the
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:31.040]   fall is going to be restored. And the supreme blessing, therefore, the ultimate blessing,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.920]   the key blessing of blessings is that God is my God and that I have a right to say,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:46.240]   "My God." Now, the whole of salvation is included in that. I must not turn aside to
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.240]   emphasize that tonight. But how often do we forget that? How often do we tend to define
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.440]   salvation in other terms rather than that? But the greatest thing a human being can ever
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:08.960]   say since the fall is, "This God is my God, my God." And that you know for certain that
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:17.000]   God is saying to you, "I am thy God. I will be to thee a God." There is nothing greater
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.840]   than that. It is the greatest blessing of all. That is what God has promised. But it
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.200]   also includes certain other things. God has promised certain temporal blessings as well
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   as spiritual blessings. He has promised those especially under the old dispensation. And
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.160]   let us never forget that the temporal blessings are meant to be pictures of and to symbolize
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:48.520]   the spiritual blessings. He has also promised, obviously, a way of justification. God cannot
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:54.800]   be my God and I cannot say my God unless I am justified, unless my sin is forgiven, unless
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:01.320]   my sin is removed, unless I am adopted and made a child of God. It is all implicit in
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:08.920]   the promise that God is to be my God. Indeed, it includes the promise of life eternal. It
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:14.880]   obviously includes the giving of the Spirit and the full application and working out of
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:23.000]   redemption in me in the matter of sanctification and my ultimate glorification. So that the
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.240]   promises you see in the covenant of grace rarely include everything. And man is called
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:39.640]   upon to respond to this by faith, by the desire for all this, and by his faithfulness and
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:47.760]   obedience to God in these new conditions. Shall I try to give you an omnibus definition
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.120]   of what we mean, then, by the covenant of grace? We can put it like this. The covenant
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:06.800]   of grace is that arrangement between the triune God and his people, whereby God carries out
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:18.560]   his eternal purpose and decree of redemption by promising his friendship. Hence, he promises
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:28.000]   full and free salvation to his people upon the basis of the vicarious atonement of the
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:37.800]   Lord Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of the covenant, and his people accept this salvation
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.560]   by faith. That is it. It includes all that. It is the promise of God's friendship, his
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.840]   being our God, that we can enter into intimate relationships with him and know him, and it
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:58.320]   is all made possible by Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of this covenant, and we enter
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:06.520]   into it by faith. Now, that is the covenant of grace, the covenant, if you like, of redemption,
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.720]   as worked out for men. Now, the thing I want to spend my time on
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   tonight is this. This great covenant which God has made with men, this covenant of grace,
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:32.960]   can be divided up into two dispensations, or if you prefer it, two administrations.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:40.680]   This one great covenant of grace is administered and has been administered in two main different
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:46.760]   ways. The way that is described in the Old Testament, the way that is described in the
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.440]   New Testament. You notice what I am saying? I am saying that there is only one covenant
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.320]   of grace. I hope before I finish tonight to prove that to you. I am simply saying it at
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:05.200]   the moment. There is only one covenant of grace, but it has been administered in two
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:13.600]   main ways, two main dispensations of the one covenant, the old and the new.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:22.240]   Now let us glance at these. What are the ways in which the covenant of grace has been dispensed
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:31.680]   under the old dispensation? Well, you go, first of all, to Genesis 3.15. I mentioned
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.920]   it last Friday evening. If you are interested in the technical term, it is generally called
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:48.400]   the protovangel, P-R-O-T, evangel, one word, the protovangel. In other words, there is
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:57.680]   a kind of foreshadowing of the whole gospel in Genesis 3.15. Now this really is to me
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   one of the most fascinating and thrilling things a man can ever encounter. Here is this
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.760]   great book which we divide up, and we call it the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.040]   Well, we all know what we mean by that. But, you know, if we were to be strictly accurate,
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:25.000]   we would not describe it in that way. The real division of the Bible is this. Everything
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.760]   you get from Genesis 1.1 to Genesis 3.14, that is one division of the Bible. From Genesis
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:44.520]   3.15 to the very end is the remainder. That is the true division. What you have got up
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:51.240]   until Genesis 3.14 is the account of the creation and of God's original covenant of works with
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:59.120]   men and of how that failed because men broke it. Beginning with Genesis 3.15, you get the
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.280]   announcement of the gospel, the covenant of grace, the way of salvation, and it is the
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.920]   whole theme of the Bible until you come to the last verse of the book of Revelation.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:19.500]   That in a sense is the real division of the Bible. But, of course, we talk about Old Testament
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:26.560]   and New Testament because we want to emphasize the two main different ways in which this
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.480]   one great covenant of grace has been administered. But here it is, beginning in Genesis 3.15,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:40.880]   "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:52.780]   It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Now, the whole of the gospel is
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:20:00.460]   there. It is there in this almost cryptic form, in this very immature form, but the
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:06.860]   whole of the gospel is there. Let me work it out with you. What does that tell us? Well,
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.620]   God tells us, first of all, that he is going to put enmity between the serpent and the
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:18.140]   woman and her seed. You see, hitherto there had been no enmity between them, but the serpent
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:24.500]   had beguiled Eve and they were very friendly together. And the woman was now under the
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.980]   dominion of the devil. And had God done nothing, that would have been the remainder of the
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:35.500]   story. But God comes in and he says, "No, I am going to break that friendship. You were
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:41.220]   meant for friendship with me, not with the devil. So I am going to put enmity between
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:48.180]   you and the devil, and between the devil and you." That is the first announcement of salvation.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.220]   Because man cannot be saved while he is a friend of the devil and an enemy of God. He
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.940]   must be a friend of God, therefore he must become an enemy of the devil. God says he
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:02.660]   is going to do that. The second thing, therefore, that is implied is this, that God is going
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:08.660]   to give man power and grace to fight the devil. He has already been defeated by him and he
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:14.540]   is his slave. He must have help and strength, God promises it. Indeed, God obviously promises
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:21.900]   to be on man's side in this fight and in this quarrel against the enemy. He applies
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:29.020]   the promise also to the seed, to thee and to thy seed. That is most important. It was
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.940]   not a temporary promise given there in Eden, it is to continue until it has achieved its
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:41.740]   ultimate purpose. You notice also that he says that the quarrel is to go on not only
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.820]   between the woman and her seed and the devil, but also between the seed of the woman and
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:55.700]   the seed of the serpent. In other words, mankind is here divided into two sections. Those who
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.180]   do not belong to Christ belong to the devil. They are the children of the devil, they are
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:07.600]   the seed of the devil. So humanity can be divided into the seed of God and of Christ
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.740]   and the seed of the devil. And there is a fight and a quarrel between them, all announced
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:19.220]   in Genesis 3.15. Then you notice that we are given the promise there of the certainty of
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:26.020]   the triumph of God and his way. The serpent is going to be bruised, his head is going
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.500]   to be bruised, he is going to be destroyed. Can't you see there a prefiguring of Calvary?
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.300]   It was there he was put to an open shame, it was there he was defeated, all promised
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:43.100]   in the protovangelium. And ultimately there is this idea, which we can see so clearly
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.780]   in the light of subsequent scripture, that the real seed of the woman is none other finally
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:56.140]   than the Lord Jesus Christ himself. Now there is the first announcement of this covenant.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:02.120]   He doesn't call it a covenant at that point, but it is a foreshadowing of the covenant
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:08.300]   that later was made more explicit. But let us come secondly to the covenant made with
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:14.340]   Noah. You will find that described in the ninth chapter of the book of Genesis, after
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:20.360]   the flood. What do we find here? Well, God promises here that he will never destroy the
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:27.300]   earth again and all flesh by means of water. He promises there will never be a return of
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:33.620]   such a flood which will destroy the earth and its peoples. He furthermore guarantees
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:39.460]   and promises that there shall always be a succession of seed, time, and harvest, cold
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:46.700]   and heat, summer and winter, day and night. God promised that that should continue, come
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:55.420]   what may. He also there promised that the forces of nature should be bridled and controlled.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.820]   In other words, the effects and results of sin and the fall are given a certain check.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:06.500]   They are held in in the promise in the covenant made with Noah. In the same way, the powers
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:16.000]   of evil are put under a greater restraint. Man is not allowed to be as violent as he
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.660]   had been and as he would like to be against other men. Man is protected against the violence
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:28.140]   both of men himself and of beasts. You read it for yourselves in Genesis 9. And it was
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:36.260]   all confirmed and sealed by the sign of the rainbow in the cloud.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:44.040]   Now the thing I want to emphasize here is this. The covenant made with Noah is not a
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:52.140]   new covenant of grace. The covenant of grace is there adumbrated in Genesis 3.15. This
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:58.020]   does not interfere with it at all. It simply introduces certain subsidiary promises and
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:04.920]   legislations. It is not a new covenant in the ultimate sense of grace and of redemption.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.340]   It is simply a temporary legislation, what is sometimes called even common grace, as
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:17.340]   distinct from the special grace which ensures our spiritual salvation.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:22.700]   But let me hurry on to the third, which is the covenant as made with Abraham. Now that
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:30.740]   is what you find in Genesis 17, which we read at the beginning. Now it is here that God
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:41.900]   first explicitly and clearly states his purposes of redemption in the exact form of a covenant.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:48.580]   He made that covenant with Abraham. What do we find here? Well, we find that here, for
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:56.140]   the first time in any definite manner, you get the beginning of a kind of church. There
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:01.740]   is a separation as between the church, the people who belong to God, and those who belong
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:09.500]   to the world. There had been a kind of family worship before and in men's houses and so
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.700]   on, but there is something new introduced in the covenant with Abraham. He chooses a
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:20.940]   particular man, a particular family, and he makes a promise to Abraham and his descendants
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:27.380]   in particular and to nobody else. There is this separation. There is the formation of
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:35.140]   a unique body, a special people of God. Most important, you noticed also the emphasis that
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:42.420]   was placed upon Abraham's faith, upon his response. It is by his faith that he enters
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:48.380]   into the covenant and begins to receive the benefits and the blessings. And you notice
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:54.420]   the spiritual character of the blessings that were promised him. Over and above the promise
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:01.080]   concerning the land, etc., there is this great promise of a spiritual seed that all the nations
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.780]   of the world are finally going to be blessed in him. Now, if you want to work that out,
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:14.260]   you just read Romans chapters 3, 4, and 5, the epistle to the Romans, chapters 3, 4,
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.900]   and 5, and the third chapter of the epistle to the Galatians, which I am going to quote
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:26.420]   in a moment. You see that there God was really giving Abraham justification. We are told
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.940]   in the epistle to the Romans that Abraham was justified by his faith, justified in a
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:38.220]   spiritual sense, and became the father of all the faithful and the father of all believers.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.180]   He was justified from sin, he was forgiven, he was adopted into God's family, and thus
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:50.540]   he becomes the father of all who believe. All was there promised to him by covenant.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:57.940]   And then I say that in addition there were those temporal blessings also.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:05.100]   Now we can never place too much emphasis upon the covenant made with Abraham. You keep your
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:10.540]   eye on the references back to that in the subsequent parts of the Bible. You will find
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:17.540]   that it is absolutely crucial. It is the great, explicit, original promise which God made
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:26.580]   hinted at, adumbrated in Genesis 3 and 15, but here stated explicitly in covenant form.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:33.700]   Then I must hurry on, of course, to the covenant which was made at Sinai, the Sinaitic covenant,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:40.700]   the covenant that was made through Moses, which you will find in Exodus, chapters 19
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:50.500]   and following. This is most important. What do we find here? Well, here the emphasis is
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:57.980]   placed especially upon the fact that this covenant is a national covenant. From here
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:04.580]   on the church and the nation become one. And to belong to the nation of Israel means to
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.580]   belong to the church, and you could not be put out of the church without being put out
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:14.540]   of the nation. A man who transgressed the law was put to death. He was not merely punished
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:20.060]   in a spiritual sense, he was literally put to death, put out of existence, put out of
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:26.620]   the nation as well. Then, of course, great prominence is given here to the giving of
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:33.820]   the law. But I do want to make this very plain and clear, that the giving of the law does
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:39.860]   not mean in any sense whatsoever that God is establishing a covenant of works with men
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:47.060]   again. I have already pointed out to you that that becomes a sheer impossibility. What is
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.660]   the point, I ask again, of making a covenant of works, of telling a man that he can save
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:57.380]   himself if he does certain things when men have failed to do that in paradise? No, the
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:02.660]   giving of the law does not mean a return to a covenant of works. The children of Israel
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:07.180]   made the terrible mistake of thinking it did, but that was their error. It does not mean
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:13.940]   that. It was simply given in order that the life of the nation should be regulated in
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.220]   certain respects, and also for certain other reasons which I am about to mention.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:28.660]   We have introduced here also the ceremonial and all the typical sacrifices and service
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:35.100]   in connection with the temple—the burnt offerings and the various other offerings,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:42.340]   the appointment of a separated priesthood, certain people set apart as priests. And we
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:48.820]   have also the promulgation of the fact that the gospel, the great covenant of grace, is
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:57.380]   to be preached now in symbols and in types. These are meant to show us the demands of
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:04.500]   God upon us, and also at the same time to remind us of God's great promise of forgiveness
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.700]   and of salvation.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:15.540]   The law is a rule of life. You can divide it in a threefold manner—the moral law,
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:24.020]   the civil law, and the ceremonial law. The certain great fixed principles of morality,
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:29.900]   the special legislation for the life of the nation, and the laws governing the ceremonies
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.900]   and the ritual.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:39.500]   Now, here is the thing I want to emphasise. The making of this subsidiary covenant with
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:48.940]   Moses on behalf of the children of Israel at Sinai in no way whatsoever interferes with
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:55.180]   the covenant of grace that had already been given to Abram and that had previously been
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.260]   hinted at in the Garden of Eden.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:02.460]   Now, let me prove that, because there are some people who regard this as an entirely
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:11.900]   new covenant. But it isn't, and I prove it in this way. Listen to Romans 4.13, "For
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:19.660]   the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not made to Abram or to his
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:30.140]   seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith." Most important, Romans 4.13.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:38.600]   It wasn't made through the law, but through faith. Listen to Galatians 3.17, "And this
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:47.700]   I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law which was
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:54.860]   four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul that it should make the promise of
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.860]   none effect."
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:02.340]   In other words, Paul's great argument in Romans and Galatians is this, that the covenant
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:08.900]   made, the subsidiary covenant made with Moses at Mansinu, doesn't interfere in any way
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:15.220]   or to the slightest extent with the great covenant of promise and of grace that God
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:20.340]   had made with Abram. That's the fundamental thing. This doesn't change it in any way
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.340]   at all.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:28.020]   But I'll say to someone, what about Galatians 4.21, where we read this, "Tell me, ye that
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.300]   desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written that Abram had
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:37.820]   two sons, one by a bond made, the other by a free woman." And where he goes on to say
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.380]   that this is an allegory, "For these are two covenants," etc. Doesn't that teach
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:49.700]   to someone that there is a subsidiary covenant? To which the answer is this. It cannot mean
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.740]   that because if it did, it would mean that Paul, in chapter 4, was contradicting his
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.740]   own great argument in chapter 3, and what he'd said in the epistle to the Romans in
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:05.660]   chapter 4. But quite apart from that, the context surely makes it quite clear. His only
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:12.300]   purpose in Galatians 4 is to differentiate between the natural Israel and the spiritual
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:19.140]   Israel. It's his way of denouncing this wrong understanding of the Jew, who argued
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:23.300]   that to belong to Israel in the flesh meant that of necessity you belong to the true seed
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:29.100]   of Abram. No, it doesn't. There is a kind of earthly agreement, there is a heavenly
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:35.260]   agreement, and it is the heavenly part of the agreement that saves. After all, the promise
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:40.660]   God made to Abram in a sense included Ishmael, didn't it? Esau was in a sense included.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:45.300]   All these people were circumcised. Yes, but they're not the children of faith. They're
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:50.860]   not the true children of promise. They belong to the realm of the flesh. God explains that
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:58.420]   to Abram, you remember, even in Genesis 17. Very well then, I say, the covenant made through
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:04.580]   Moses when the law was given does not in any way interfere with the covenant of grace.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:13.500]   It simply was meant to do two things. Here they are. The first is, it was meant to increase
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:21.580]   the consciousness of sin. It wasn't meant primarily to do that. Moreover, says Paul,
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:29.100]   the promise entered that the offence might abound. That's what he says in Romans 5 and
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:36.420]   20. He's argued the same in Romans 4, 15. Listen to him in Galatians 3, 17, which reads
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:43.540]   like this, "And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ,
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.340]   the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul that it should
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:54.740]   make the promise of none effect." And then he puts it like this, "Wherefore" – this
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:01.140]   is subsequent. Now that's the first great argument, that the law is given in order to
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:08.980]   show the exceeding sinfulness of sin. In order to convict the nation and all others of the
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:16.260]   utter hopelessness of a man dealing with his own sinfulness. So, the second purpose of
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:23.020]   the law we can put as Galatians 3, 24 puts it, which is this, "Wherefore, the law was
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:32.660]   our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith." You see,
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:38.780]   the original covenant is the covenant which teaches justification by faith. That is the
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:44.460]   covenant God made with Abram and his seed. That's the fundamental thing. What's the
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.020]   point of the law? Well, the point of the law is to bring us to that, to act as a kind of
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:57.220]   teacher, to act as a pedagogue, to act as a coach, a teacher, something that shows us
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:04.460]   our absolute need of Christ, the utter necessity of Christ. It was never meant to save people.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.420]   The law was never given in order that people might be saved. You notice that I'm emphasizing
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.500]   this and speaking with considerable feeling about it, and I do so for this reason, that
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:21.740]   you will find certain Bibles and certain books on the Bible which would teach you that God
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.860]   told the children of Israel that they could save themselves if they kept the law, that
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.820]   he gave them the law in order to give them another way of saving themselves, which is
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:36.540]   an utter contradiction of the teaching of Scripture. The law is not meant to interfere
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:44.860]   in any way with the fundamental covenant of grace, the promise given to Abram. The law
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:51.660]   was added four hundred and thirty years afterwards in reality in order to make the people realize
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:58.460]   their sinfulness, the utter impossibility of their saving themselves, and the absolute
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:06.020]   need of God providing a way of salvation himself, which he did ultimately in and through the
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.580]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:15.460]   Very well, now, there we've been dealing with the ways in which the great covenant
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:27.380]   of grace was administered and revealed and shown to the people under the old dispensation.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:37.100]   That is an account of the old dispensation of the covenant of grace. And that leads on,
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:45.900]   of course, to the new dispensation, which is the way that God has revealed and perfected
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:52.580]   and re-ratified and fulfilled the promise and all that is contained in the covenant
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:39:00.540]   of grace in and through his Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:10.100]   My time is gone. I thought of going on also to tell you tonight something of the new administration,
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.620]   the new dispensation of the covenant, and also to show you how there is indeed only
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:21.180]   one covenant, and to show you the differences between the two administrations. But I can't
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:26.100]   do that. It would be very wrong. I think you will all agree to rush it in the last few
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:34.860]   final moments. Shall we then hold that over until, God willing, we meet together next
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:41.100]   Friday evening, when I hope to commence our consideration of this great matter by dealing
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.100]   with that.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.820]   Let me try to summarize for you, therefore, what we've been looking at tonight. Look
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:54.700]   at it like this. First of all, God made with men—men perfect, men made in the image and
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:05.220]   likeness of God—a covenant of works. He was to inherit that eternal life without possibility
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:15.340]   of end with God, if he kept the commandment, the law. Men broke it. Sin and the fall, and
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:21.340]   the pollution and the degradation followed. Now the thing I want to emphasize is that
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:34.180]   God since then has only made one fundamental covenant with men. It is the covenant of grace.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:40.780]   And he has revealed that great covenant of grace in the ways that I've been describing
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:47.540]   in the Old Testament. You see, having stated the thing itself, he makes it explicit in
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:56.300]   his covenant with Abram, and then he goes on to show it still more fully by the covenant
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:03.940]   that he makes with Moses. But the covenant with Moses in no way modifies the covenant
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:11.220]   of grace. It simply shows men there is not an absolute need of the covenant of grace.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:17.380]   The law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. It wasn't meant to do more than
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.060]   that. It wasn't a way of salvation in and of itself. It never was that. It isn't that.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:30.420]   It never can be that. There is only one way of salvation, and I hope to give you the proofs
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.020]   of that contention and of that statement next Friday night.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:39.780]   Now I think we've all probably learned one thing, and I trust I've seen it more clearly
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:45.660]   than we've ever seen it before. Christian people have often expressed surprise that
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:50.180]   the early church decided to incorporate the Old Testament with its new literature. And
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:56.340]   they say, "I don't see really as a Christian why I need to be bothered about the Old Testament."
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:02.260]   Well if anybody goes out of this service still feeling that, I have failed, and failed lamentably.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:08.140]   Because I've tried to show you that the same great fundamental message in the Old as in
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:17.140]   the New. That there it is in the Old as in the New. That there is this great unity. And
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:22.780]   if we want to know about God's great purpose, we must delight in tracing it from the very
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:30.340]   beginning in the Garden of Eden right the way through until we come to our Lord. The
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:36.660]   Old Testament, the New Testament. The old administration of the covenant of grace, the
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:44.140]   new administration of the same covenant of grace. The marvelous plan of God unfolded.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:54.940]   The gospel begins not in Matthew 1.1, but in Genesis 3.15. Let's never forget that.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.420]   So let us go to our Old Testament and look for the gospel in it. You'll find it there
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:06.100]   almost everywhere in a most amazing and astounding manner. And it is your business and mine,
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:15.580]   as well as our privilege, to seek it and to rejoice in it as we find it in the Old Testament.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.660]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
