[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860]   - Tell me what you think of this,
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.980]   what I always call protocol.
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.980]   If I want to learn something from a manuscript I read
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.000]   or a book chapter, I used to highlight things.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.700]   And I had a very elaborate,
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.500]   extracted from my university days,
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000]   system of stars and exclamation marks and underline
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.980]   that mean a lot to me, that can, yes,
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.860]   bring me back to a given segment within the chapter.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.020]   But a few years ago, I was teaching a course
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.020]   in the biology department at Stanford.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.180]   And for some reason we had them read a study
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.100]   about information retention.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.980]   And I learned from that study that one of the best things
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.940]   we can do is read information in whatever form,
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.820]   a magazine, research article, et cetera, a book.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.980]   And then to take some time away from that material,
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.460]   maybe walk, maybe close one's eyes,
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860]   maybe leave them open, doesn't matter.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.040]   And just try and remember specific elements.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.380]   How much does one remember?
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.140]   Then go back to the material and look at it.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.500]   And I've just been positively astonished
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.420]   at how much more information I can learn
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.460]   when I'm not simply going through motor commands
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.080]   of just underlining things and highlighting them,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.980]   but stepping away and thinking, okay,
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.500]   yeah, I don't remember how many subjects there were.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.240]   I'll go back and check that, maybe make a note.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.540]   And okay, they did this, then they did that.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.740]   And then it's crystallized.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.580]   And when, as I say this, I realize,
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.260]   of course, this should work.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.160]   This is the way that the brain learns.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.300]   But somehow that's not the way we are taught to learn.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.740]   - Yeah, well, I'm smiling because when I was 22,
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.700]   I wrote this book called "How to Become a Straight A Student."
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.540]   And the whole premise of the book was,
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.020]   I'm gonna talk to actual college students
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.940]   who have straight A's and who don't seem
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.660]   completely ground out, like not burnt out.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.060]   And I'm just gonna interview them.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.180]   And the protocol was, how did you study
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.380]   for the last test did you study for?
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.460]   How did you take notes for the last?
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.020]   So I was just asking them to walk through their methodology.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.140]   The core idea of that book was active recall.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.580]   That was the core idea, that replicating ideas,
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.740]   ways to say is replicating the information from scratch
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.260]   as if teaching a class without looking at your notes.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.180]   That is the only way to learn.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.680]   And the thing about it was, it's a trade-off.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.900]   It doesn't take, it's efficient, it doesn't take much time,
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.980]   but it's incredibly mentally taxing, right?
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.260]   This is why students often avoid it.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.740]   It is difficult to sit there and try to replicate
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.180]   and pull forth, okay, what did I read here?
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.020]   How did that work?
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.420]   It's mentally very taxing, but it's very time efficient.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.820]   If you're willing to essentially put up with that pain,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.740]   you learn very quickly.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.960]   And not only do you learn very quickly, you don't forget.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.220]   It's almost like you have a pseudo-photographic memory
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.060]   when you study this way.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.860]   You sit down to do a test and you're replicating
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.220]   like whole lines from like what you studied.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.780]   The ideas sort of come out fully formed
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.980]   because it's such a fantastic way to actually learn.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.820]   It was my key, like the whole premise
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.460]   that got me writing that book is I went through this period
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.580]   as a college student, where I came in freshman year,
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.140]   was like a fine student.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.820]   Not a great student, but a fine student.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.660]   And I was rowing crew and I was sort of like excited
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.560]   to do that.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.700]   And then I developed a heart condition
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.060]   and had to stop congenital wiring in the heart,
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.140]   atrial flutter thing.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.340]   It meant I couldn't row crew anymore.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.780]   So prolapse of some sort?
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.140]   It was a circuitry issue that would lead
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.980]   to an extremely rapid heartbeat.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.500]   It's like a really rapid, like tachardia, right?
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.540]   You get 250 beats a minute just,
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.460]   and it could be exercise induced, right?
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.820]   Which is not optimal.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.680]   You could take beta blockers,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.460]   which would moderate the electrical timing,
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.260]   but beta blockers reduce your max heart rate.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.140]   And if you're a athlete where the entire thing
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.660]   that matters is your max heart rate,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.280]   so you're doing something like 2,000 meter rows,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.880]   your performance on beta blockers just goes down.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   And it makes no sense.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.560]   It's like being a basketball player
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.620]   that wears weighted shoes.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.460]   It's too frustrating.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.320]   - Right, it also makes you super mellow.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.540]   - I was pretty mellow guy.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.820]   (both laughing)
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.600]   But I was a worse rower, so.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.440]   So I stopped that.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.380]   I was like, okay, I want to get serious about my studies.
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.880]   I was like, I can get serious about my studies
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.720]   and writing, right?
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.320]   That's when I actually made the decisions
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.900]   that I'd been stuck with for the next 25 years after that.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.320]   But one of the things I did to get serious about my studies
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.600]   is I said, I'm going to systematically experiment
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.320]   with how to study for tests and how to write papers.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.840]   And I would try this.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.680]   How did it go?
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.600]   Deconstruct experiment.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.440]   Try this.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.260]   How did it go?
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.100]   Deconstruct experiment.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.880]   And active recall was the thing to turn me all around.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.440]   And so I went from a pretty good student
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.840]   to 4.0 every single quarter.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.160]   Sophomore year, junior year, senior year.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.880]   I got one A minus between my sophomore year
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.840]   through my senior year.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.520]   It was like this miraculous transformation.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.720]   It was active recall.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.160]   I rebuilt all of my studying.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   So if it was for a humanities class,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.480]   I had a whole way of taking notes.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.240]   It was all built around doing active recall.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.600]   For math classes, my main study tool
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.520]   was a stack of white paper.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.960]   All right, do this proof, white piece of paper.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.920]   And just, can I do it from scratch?
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.420]   If I could, I know that technique.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.960]   If I don't, all right, I'm going to come back
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.800]   and try it again later.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.320]   Completely transformed.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.440]   I did so well academically,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.320]   that's why I ended up writing that book
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.140]   that basically spread that message to other people.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.640]   So I'm a huge advocate for active recall.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.160]   It's really hard, but it is the way to learn new things.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   - And as you pointed out, it is very time efficient.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.280]   - Oh yeah.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.700]   I mean, it was a problem.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.760]   It was a social problem for me
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.780]   that I would have to pretend during finals period
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.880]   that I was going to the library to study
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.400]   because I would be done studying.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.960]   This active recall, it's brutal,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.100]   but it's incredibly efficient.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.040]   You sit down there, I would have my cards.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.880]   I would mark it.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.320]   Okay, I struggled with this.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.700]   I'd put it in this pile.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.680]   I got it done, I'd put it in this pile.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.120]   And so then you would just go back
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.920]   to the I struggled with it pile and work on that
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.380]   and then make a new I struggle with a pile.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.480]   And these would exponentially decay.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.320]   And so in like a few hours, you could really master,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.880]   you know, with a few other tricks that worked,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.680]   you could really master the material pretty quickly.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.640]   And then what am I supposed to do?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.080]   I didn't do all nighters.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.920]   You don't want to make any sense.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.480]   Like active recall is how you prepare.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.600]   It's going to take four hours and it's going to be tough.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.080]   So do it in the morning when you have energy
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.720]   and then you're done.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.560]   - I love it.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.480]   I learned essentially all of neuroanatomy
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.280]   looking down the microscope at tissue samples.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.040]   And then I would try and take photographs with my eyes.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.480]   I do not have a photographic memory,
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   but then I would get home in the evening,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.500]   look through the neuroanatomy textbook,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.600]   lie down and try and fly through
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.280]   the different circuits in my mind.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.460]   And then if I arrived at a structure in the brain
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.160]   that I couldn't identify,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.680]   I would then go check my notes and go back.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.720]   So basically I learned neuroanatomy, which I, you know,
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.200]   I'm poor at a great many things in life,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.620]   but neuroanatomy I'm solid at.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.720]   And then some, if I may say so.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.680]   And it's because there's a mental map.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.840]   You can kind of move through it,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.720]   you know, fly through it dynamically.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.400]   Thank you for tuning into the Huberman Lab Clips channel.
