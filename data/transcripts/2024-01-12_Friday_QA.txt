[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.560]   Today on Radical Personal Finance is live Q&A.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.320]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.520]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.720]   My name is Joshua Sheets, today is Friday, January 12, 2024.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.480]   And on this Friday, as we do on every Friday in which I can arrange the appropriate recording
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.060]   technology, I should come up with something a little bit catchier than that, we record
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.680]   a live Q&A show.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.680]   You call in, talk about anything that you want.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.140]   This is your chance to raise the topics, interact with me, give any feedback that you'd like
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.800]   to give on recent shows, ask any questions about your personal life, ask any questions
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.200]   about life in general, bring up any topic that you want.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.040]   I don't screen the calls other than to, well, let's see, I don't screen the subjects of
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.320]   the calls, but I do screen the callers.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.240]   If you would like to join me on a Friday Q&A show, you can do that by becoming a patron
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   of the show.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.640]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, sign up to support the show there on Patreon, and that will
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.520]   gain access for you to one of these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.720]   I do that to keep the amount of callers at a reasonable number that works for recording
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   a show.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   We begin with Martin in the Czech Republic.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   Martin, welcome.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.600]   I'm calling again from Prague now with something completely different that's been on my mind
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.920]   that I'd like to hear your input on.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.760]   Recently I had a chat with a German friend who's got this fantastic multilingual family
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.720]   dynamic going on.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.360]   So he and his Ukrainian wife live in Sweden, and their daughter is picking up German from
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.520]   the father, Russian and Ukrainian from the mother, Swedish outside of the house, and
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.880]   English in school as a second language.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   And at 18 years old, she's basically fluent in all these languages, except maybe her English
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.120]   is a little bit less polished due to limited exposure.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.260]   But this got me thinking.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.560]   My wife and I are looking to start a family quite soon, and I've always envied kids with
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.800]   bilingual parents who just seamlessly pick up that second language.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:35.060]   However, me and my wife are both Czech natives, so my idea was to exclusively switch to English
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.240]   when communicating with our future child, basically for their entire childhood.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.000]   And of course, before doing that, I would definitely need to take a lot of time learning
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.860]   a proper accent in a way you, for example, mentioned to a previous listener a couple
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.600]   of weeks ago, since there I could really do some work.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.760]   But I have two concerns with this.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.560]   First of all, I do worry that this linguistic shift might kind of dampen the spark and humor
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.640]   in our relationship, because so much of our connection with my wife is built on the nuances
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.480]   and bonds and so on in our shared language.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:19.680]   I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, and I fear losing that might harm our relationship.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.040]   And secondly, I wonder if this approach would be genuinely effective, or if there might
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920]   be a better way.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.420]   I would really hate to embark on this long-term journey with the language, risking what I
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.800]   mentioned, only to find out that my child is no better off than others without an English-speaking
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   pattern.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.000]   So I would really appreciate your thoughts on this matter.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Absolutely.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.480]   So let me begin with the second concern that you have first.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.940]   Is it effective?
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.560]   To make that kind of change, absolutely it would be effective.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.460]   There's no question in my mind that any child who is raised in a genuinely multilingual
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.760]   environment that features people speaking to that child in different languages is going
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.200]   to have a significant advantage over other people who are interacting with languages
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.640]   in artificial ways.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.000]   Where I first became inspired years ago with the ability of children to learn languages
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.440]   naturally was when I stumbled across a video on YouTube of a little Russian girl named
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:41.480]   Bella, and she was appearing on a Russian version of one of these Russia's Got Talent
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.320]   TV shows, something like that.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.640]   She was, at the time, I think about five years old.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.800]   She could have been four, could have been six.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   You can find the clip on YouTube easily enough.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.360]   Just search for Bella Russian Polyglot and you'll find it.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.260]   And she was being quizzed by native speakers in something like six languages.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.560]   So she had Russian, she had English, she had Spanish, I think she had French, she had Chinese,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.380]   and she had Arabic.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.900]   And she was not only speaking those languages with the native speakers who were quizzing
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:20.740]   her, but she was also reading in those languages live on the show and basically narrating in
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.460]   a very concise fashion what she was reading as part of proving her ability.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.940]   And so this I found really inspiring.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.420]   Here's this little girl who speaks six very different languages that they're not part
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.900]   of the same language family in any way, shape, or form.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.540]   And so I started looking into it and I found some interviews and discussions with her mother.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.380]   I forget all the details now because this was years ago, but her mother was, I think,
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.960]   a teacher of some kind, a college professor perhaps, but highly educated.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.600]   And her mother had accomplished this multilingual ability primarily by hiring people into their
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.040]   home who spoke those languages natively.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.300]   And so Bella had been exposed to these languages from infancy based upon having nannies, au pairs,
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.620]   tutors, et cetera, in the home speaking those languages with her.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.420]   And she clearly had a significant level of comfort in those languages.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.500]   I have found a couple of other polyglot parents who have done the same thing with their children.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.180]   I forget the guy's name, and I forget the name of his platform, but I found a guy in
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.780]   Canada who had done something similar.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.120]   He himself was a Chinese speaker.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.900]   His wife was a Japanese speaker.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.700]   He was living in Quebec.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.340]   And what he did was he hired also a Spanish speaking nanny and his children from infancy
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.940]   were fluent in all five of those languages.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.880]   He spoke to his children in Chinese.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.620]   The mother spoke to the children in Japanese as did grandparents.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.540]   The mother's parents were speaking in Japanese.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.100]   I think their household language was English.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.340]   And then in school they were learning French and English.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.780]   And so they were covering, and then they had the Spanish speaking nanny who taught them
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.000]   Spanish and they were fluent with her.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.980]   And so that approach absolutely works.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:12.860]   And if you had the highest goals for total fluency with your children, with them having
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.020]   the best experience of being native speakers in these languages, then I think what your
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.020]   German friend and his Ukrainian wife are doing is absolutely the way to go about it.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.100]   Because the children never know anything other than this native level fluency and they're
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.580]   completely competent in the languages from birth.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:36.380]   Excuse me, I need to sneeze.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.180]   So is it effective?
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.980]   My answer is yes, it is effective.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.320]   Is there a better way?
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.460]   My answer is no, there is no better way.
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.440]   Now the caveat that I would point out would be that if that were all you did, you only
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.660]   had native language tutors or speakers involved in the children's lives in the way that Bella
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:04.060]   or the Canadian guy has done, then that would not be enough to reach the highest levels
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.780]   of fluency desired.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.580]   One of the things that was interesting for me growing up in the United States, I interacted
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.320]   with a lot of people whose native language was Spanish.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.060]   Their parents were immigrants to the United States.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.380]   They exclusively spoke Spanish with their parents.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.540]   However, they were in an English speaking school system, et cetera.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:28.660]   And what I found so fascinating is that they spoke colloquial Spanish better than I did.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.560]   They spoke Spanish fluently.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.300]   They had a native accent.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.180]   They spoke colloquial Spanish very fluently without any trouble because that was their
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.300]   native home language that they speak with their parents.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.700]   But they had no academic ability in the language.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.020]   They couldn't pick up a Spanish novel and enjoy reading it because there was too much
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.980]   unknown vocabulary.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.740]   And so I, on the other hand, because I learned my Spanish in something of the academic approach,
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.540]   my reading ability was higher than their reading ability.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.420]   And yet I didn't speak native sounding Spanish.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.880]   My accent was inferior to their accent and I couldn't speak the language as fluently
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.860]   as they could, but I had a higher level in the language.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.220]   So I'm pointing out that speaking a language colloquially is a perfectly acceptable way
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.220]   to do it.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.020]   But if you genuinely wanted your children to be educated, you would need to make sure
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.980]   that they were reading, that they were doing work, that they were writing in whatever your
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.860]   target language is, et cetera.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.860]   Now, is it effective?
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.980]   Yes, it's effective.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.980]   Is there a better way?
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.660]   No, there is no better way.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.760]   But now let's go back to the beginning.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.500]   Could that linguistic shift dampen the spark or the humor or even the relationship that
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.300]   you have with your children?
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:51.340]   My answer is it could, and this is why I have chosen to maintain all of my relationships
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.940]   with my children in English.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.460]   Even though my wife and I both speak Spanish at a pretty decent level, probably an advanced,
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.340]   a lower advanced level, something like that, certainly your English is probably much better
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.940]   than my Spanish, and you have a chance to use it more frequently than I do.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:17.480]   Even so, I have not chosen to try to pursue this path because it's just not entirely comfortable
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:25.980]   for me, and I don't know how to have that nuance of communication and the intimacy of
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.420]   relationship that I desire to have with my children in another language.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.100]   And so I choose to speak English.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:38.980]   My wife speaks English to the children, and we don't try to do anything else for the reasons
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.540]   that you stated.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.260]   It's not because I'm concerned about accent.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.860]   I think you should wipe that concern off of your list.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.700]   You have a perfectly acceptable accent in English.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.580]   There's no need for you to spend any time in accent training, and you would not damage
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.640]   or harm your child in any way, shape, or form from speaking to your children with the English
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.220]   accent that you have right now.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.060]   So I don't think that's a concern at all.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.740]   I think that your level of English is certainly capable of doing this that you've described,
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.740]   but it may simply not result in the intimacy of relationship that you desire with your
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.740]   children.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.420]   And to me, that's a perfectly valid reason not to use another language.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.600]   I don't think it's necessary.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.800]   So earlier I said, "Yes, is it effective?
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.100]   Is there a better way?"
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.100]   No.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:30.960]   I don't think it's necessary for you to achieve excellent outcome with your children.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.260]   I don't think it's necessary that you transform your relationship with them into English.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.660]   What you should do is you should make sure they're surrounded by English from an early
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.660]   age.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:46.660]   And so the best path, I would say, is simply make a habit of reading to your children in
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:51.420]   English, and then expose your children to appropriate English media when you choose
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.420]   to.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:58.300]   English is the easiest language in the world to learn because there's the best materials
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.180]   available in English more than any other foreign language.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.340]   And so people who become truly skilled in English and acquire a native-like accent,
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:13.340]   acquire a native-like ability, they do that reliably and consistently because of the abundance
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.540]   of English materials for them to learn with.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.020]   And so what I would say is get yourself some storybooks and just read English language
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.340]   stories to your children from the beginning.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.300]   Expose your children to English media when appropriate, videos, songs, all of those kinds
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.500]   of things.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.300]   Your children will have some form of their education in English.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.780]   And if I were in your shoes, I would make sure that a significant portion of their education
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.100]   was in English, either by substituting the English classes and training that they'll
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.020]   be receiving in the local government schools or by homeschooling in some way, shape, or
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:56.500]   form with English curriculum so that your children's education level is very, very high
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.500]   in English.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.220]   And I think you can do that while simultaneously keeping Czech as your primary language, the
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.420]   primary family language, and the primary language of your relationship.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.540]   So I don't think it's necessary to do this.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:16.220]   And I have found that in many ways my children's foreign languages, because of academic practice,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.300]   are ahead of some other native speakers.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:27.620]   As one simple example, some time back, this was a good time back, I happened to meet a
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:34.300]   French-speaking family on an airline and I invited them over for lunch.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.060]   And these people had moved to the United States.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.980]   I met them on a flight from the United States.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.060]   And they came over for lunch and we were chatting and we were visiting.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:50.420]   And I found it so fascinating that my child's French ability was ahead of their child's
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.460]   French ability, even though French was their family language.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.020]   And it has to do with exactly what I said in terms of academic ability.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.980]   My child was at the time, had read five or six Jules Verne novels in French and was comfortably
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.560]   enjoying them because I placed a high degree on French academic ability.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.680]   Their child was a native French speaker, but all of the content that their child was consuming
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.360]   was in English because they were now living in the United States and he wasn't getting
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.320]   any academic training in French.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.160]   And so I don't see any reason why you can't maintain both of those tracks.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.960]   And if you will simply have your children consume significant amounts of English-speaking
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.080]   media, which is easy, plenty of English movies, English TV shows, English programs, English
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.720]   YouTube, English Khan Academy, et cetera, and then supplement that with lots and lots
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.240]   of reading, then there's no reason at all why you should need to change your family
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.140]   language from Czech to English.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.840]   And I wouldn't for those reasons.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.080]   That's really helpful.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:57.320]   And I think the example with French, that's really interesting.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:03.560]   It's at the end of the day, all language skills need to be acquired based upon practice.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.140]   And so while the ability to read, the ability to write, the ability to speak, and the ability
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.240]   to listen, while these are clearly all related, they are not the same.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.720]   And they need to be trained systematically at each level.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.760]   When you speak a language natively, you become very highly skilled at listening and you become
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.880]   skilled at speaking, but you don't automatically become skilled at reading and you definitely
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.160]   don't automatically become skilled at writing.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.400]   So these are separate disciplines that have to be trained separately.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.720]   But the good news is they can simply be trained separately.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:42.200]   And you can, so for example, in my own children, where their abilities are inferior is with
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.320]   regard to listening ability.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   And that's because instead of being surrounded by the language in a colloquial fashion, where
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:56.160]   they learn to pick up on all of the slang, casual, slurred conversation, et cetera, all
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.880]   of their language exposure to foreign languages is basically academic.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.440]   It comes from listening to audio books.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.360]   It comes from reading books.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.560]   And it comes from, in many cases, dubbed and translated TV shows or movies.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.440]   And so what they don't have is they don't have the street colloquial listening skill.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.920]   But as far as I'm concerned, that's one of the easiest and simplest skills to acquire.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.840]   So that can be put off until a later time.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:29.120]   The harder skills to acquire are the skills of academic level reading and academic level
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.120]   writing.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.440]   And so it's impossible for me to believe, based upon the research and the experience
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.840]   that I've had, that somebody who is skilled with academic level reading, academic level
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:49.400]   writing, who is skilled with lots of high-level appropriate speaking abilities can't learn
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:56.560]   to understand easily enough a colloquial register of speech and can't relatively easily learn
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.520]   to speak in a colloquial lower-level register of conversation.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.260]   So I think that's the least important thing, rather than the most important thing.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.680]   And I think that's something that should happen.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.640]   But it doesn't need to happen at the beginning.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.960]   Anything else, Martin?
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   No.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.600]   Thank you so much.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   My pleasure.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   And I do think it's a great strategy, and absolutely, English has to be your primary
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   second language.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   My only other comment would be that there should be no reason why you shouldn't add
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.360]   in other languages.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.960]   As you can see from the experience of your friend, I think multilingualism is really
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.040]   only hard because it's hard for us the way that we learn in an academic fashion.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.280]   But I have found that if you strip away the idea that multilingualism is hard and you
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.320]   simply find resources, then it's actually pretty easy.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.720]   And I've watched this happen with two children.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.200]   I've got a sample set growing and building.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.840]   And I just watch the progression go through, where, for example, my eight-year-old daughter,
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.380]   a couple of years ago, she didn't want to learn any languages, and I taught her Spanish.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.240]   She didn't like Spanish until I found some books that had girls and horses in them.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.520]   And then three months later, she said, "Spanish is my favorite."
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.920]   She didn't like French at the time.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.360]   Well, now she loves Spanish and French, as long as I can find books with girls and horses.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   She loves it.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.000]   She's like, "You know, I just like it so much.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.360]   These are my favorite languages."
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.160]   But she doesn't like German right now.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.440]   But I tell her, "Give it three months, six months, and you'll like German, too."
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.280]   And then she's doing Latin, and it's just not hard.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.480]   And that's the thing that took me a while to come to that belief, is I grew up thinking
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.360]   learning languages was hard.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:40.960]   And then, again, I found research where linguists have found that there are certain places,
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.760]   there's a certain part of Africa where I think there's a valley where it's very normal that
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.000]   people in that valley speak five different languages.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.080]   And so, for them, multilingualism is totally normal.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.120]   And your experience as a European is much more like this.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.520]   It's much more normal in your cultural context than in my cultural context to be multilingual.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.400]   I was with a friend in Luxembourg a few months ago.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.680]   And all Luxembourg students, all of them, speak four languages.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.400]   They have Luxembourgish, English, French, and German.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.640]   And they're all equally fluent in all of them.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.720]   So multilingualism is not hard.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.520]   It is harder to learn a language like English that has a vastly larger vocabulary than,
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.120]   say, a local tribal language of some kind that may have a vocabulary of some tens of
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.040]   thousands of words rather than hundreds of thousands of words.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.120]   But generally speaking, most of that is just specialized knowledge and specialized content
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.520]   that comes in that is just not relevant on a day-to-day basis.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.520]   All right.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   Let's see.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.880]   Kevin dropped off, so we'll go to Tran.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.440]   Tran, welcome to the show.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.080]   How can I serve you today?
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   Tran, you're up.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.920]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:58.640]   I'm a student from Germany, and I have a question that relates to Korea.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.800]   So my goal is to become a financial planner.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.320]   I'm inspired by a lot of people, including you.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:16.120]   Currently, I'm 23, and I have already finished my second semester at a business school, business
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   administration.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.000]   I took it just because it was the best available choice at the time.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.400]   I kind of regret it a little bit, but it is what it is.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.200]   I'm also working, since I started university, as an auditor's assistant because I thought
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   the best way to learn about finance is just reading about financial reports, and it was
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.240]   a great experience.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.080]   But actually, I'm not a good office worker.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:54.160]   I am not good at focusing on details and doing a very detailed job.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.260]   I'm more of a big-picture guy, so I don't think this job really fits me.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:06.480]   But then I heard about your podcast, and you said that maybe doing the hard work is better,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.820]   so maybe it's better for me to try to fix that weakness for myself.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:18.340]   But on the other side, I want to get into the world of financial planning and helping
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.440]   others plan their finance sooner.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:32.140]   So I'm having a conflict here, like maybe achieving my goal sooner or trying to keep
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.920]   working here and fix my personal issues.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.860]   When you say you have a goal of working as a financial planner, that would be a goal
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:46.460]   to work as a financial planner inside Germany, inside of the German financial system.
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.460]   Is that correct?
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.740]   Actually, no.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.460]   My far-sighted goal is moving to the U.S.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.940]   I really love the U.S.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:04.460]   I lived in Vietnam and Germany, and it was always too constrained for me.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:12.220]   So I want to move to Texas in the future, and that is also a problem for me.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:19.940]   I want to have my certified financial planner certificate, but also want to try to figure
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:26.740]   out a way to move to the U.S., but that still has a long way to go, I think.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.740]   Okay.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.740]   Well, the Texans will welcome you.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.740]   They'll give you a cowboy hat, give you a giant pickup truck, and they will welcome
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.060]   you when you're able to get there.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:39.700]   So is your question – let me just make sure I answer the question that you're actually
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.700]   asking.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:47.860]   It seems to me like you are asking a fairly broad question of essentially how do I think
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:53.560]   through these different options, being a 23-year-old, studying business administration, wanting
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.020]   to become a financial planner, wanting to move to the United States, how do I integrate
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.020]   all these things?
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.660]   Is that correct, or are you asking a more specific question?
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:08.780]   That's the broader issue, yes, but also the more minor problem that I have right now is
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:18.780]   do I keep trying to improve at this auditor job, or should I try to already get experience
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.060]   in the – maybe at the financial planning firm?
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:30.700]   Also, I have a side hustle to help people with their taxes, because you said just try
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:37.380]   to start your business by finding customers, and I already have 10.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.340]   So that was like since a month ago.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.580]   So working as – you are currently working as an auditor.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.820]   Do you have any certifications related to auditing?
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.460]   No, I'm only an auditor's assistant.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.180]   Okay, an assistant.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.820]   And how long have you been doing that work now?
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.860]   One and a half years.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:06.120]   After one and a half years experience, it sounds like you have learned with certainty
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.700]   that this is not a career path that you are interested in.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.820]   Is that correct?
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.100]   Yes.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:18.660]   So speaking to that issue specifically, when you are young – and I'm assuming you are
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.060]   unmarried and do not have children.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.500]   Is that correct?
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.820]   Yes.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.300]   Okay.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:31.800]   So when you are young, I believe that your basic bias or your basic instinct should be
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:39.720]   to gain as much experience in as many different areas as possible, because the costs of switching,
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.260]   the costs of changing, are very low.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.840]   Now I think there's probably a cultural distinction here between your native culture and my native
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.360]   culture.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:56.400]   Coming from a U.S. American perspective, switching and changing things a lot, it used to be looked
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   down on.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.640]   Nobody looks down on it anymore.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.140]   And there's certainly a bad thing if you're switching because you're getting fired every
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.140]   two months.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.140]   Okay.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.140]   That's going to be figured out.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.940]   But if you've been working at something for a year and a half and you've discovered that
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.580]   this is not for me, then move on.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:18.020]   Be done with that, because there's no point in investing more of your time and energy
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.740]   into something that you know is not for you unless it forms some strategic part of your
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:29.940]   overall plan, which the most obvious thing would be, is this specific skill something
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.600]   that could allow me to gain access to the United States?
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:40.460]   So setting that aside for a moment, just speaking broadly, at 23 years old, you should be switching,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:46.460]   changing quickly from one thing to the next, and you should be analyzing your experience
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:51.380]   in each opportunity that you have in order to understand what do I like, what do I not
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.140]   like, where should I go with this, where could I go with this, do I want to go forward with
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.140]   this.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.580]   But at the end of the day, if you look at a job such as working as an auditor, and you
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.340]   can imagine yourself being successful at that job, and then you look back and you recognize,
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.020]   but I don't want this, I don't want to be a successful auditor, then get out of there
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.980]   and go try something else.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:19.500]   Go and do something else and get yourself exposure to some other aspect of the business.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.540]   If you know that generally speaking your goal is to become a financial planner, then you
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.340]   should move as quickly as possible in the direction of financial planning.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.240]   And so you should move in the direction, whatever is convenient to you.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.060]   In the German system, that might be working at a bank, or working in banking, it would
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.820]   be much better for you at this stage of your career to be an assistant to a bank officer,
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:47.620]   or an assistant to a bank auditor, or assistant to a bank tax advisor, or something like that,
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.220]   then to work as an assistant to an auditor.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.860]   So it might be a bank, it might be an insurance office, it could be a life insurance office,
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:01.620]   it could be a property and casualty insurance office, it could be a stock manager, some
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.660]   form of investment advisor, etc.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:10.220]   But get yourself as quickly as possible, as close as you can to your long-term career
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.220]   ambition.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.580]   So if you want to be a financial planner, get yourself close to working in financial
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.580]   planning.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:20.100]   It's going to bring you down a path that you know you don't want to succeed at.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.500]   Because time is your most precious thing.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.200]   Everything except time can be managed artificially.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.060]   If you needed money, you can get money.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.060]   Money is pretty easy to get.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.020]   If you need experience, you can get experience.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.940]   If you need knowledge, you can get knowledge.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.300]   If you need academic qualifications or certifications, etc.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.500]   All of that stuff can be gotten very quickly.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.600]   Time is the scarce resource.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:48.860]   So at 23, you want to be pushing yourself consistently to get as close as you can to
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:54.780]   your goals and get basically around the environment that could lead to the accomplishment of your
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.780]   goal.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:00.520]   It's much easier to make progress to be exactly where you want to go when you're around where
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.900]   you think you might want to go than when you're on the other side of the country.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.300]   And time is very short because at 23 years old, you have a very narrow window of time
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.020]   where you need to build your career and you need to build your skills and build your foundation
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.700]   before you get married, before you have children, etc.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.700]   So time should be the thing that is putting urgency on you.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.980]   So that would be my comment on auditing.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:28.540]   Now, if you know you want to go to the United States and that's something that you definitely
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:37.900]   want to do, then once again, you should chart and create the most direct, fastest path towards
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.060]   accomplishing that goal that you can come up with.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:46.780]   Don't spend 10 years building a life in Germany if you know you want to move to the United
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.100]   States.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.620]   If you know you want to move to the United States, then go as quickly as you possibly
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.620]   can.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.500]   Because every year that you spend in the United States will be so valuable for you in terms
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:04.760]   of the connections made, the skills learned, all of the abilities learned, the year ticking
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.900]   forward on a visa, the year ticking forward towards permanent residency, towards citizenship,
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   etc.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   And so you need to focus first on that.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:20.700]   That's more important and determinative for you than is being a financial planner.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.740]   Because once you have the ability to be in the United States and the ability to live
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.060]   in the United States, to work in the United States, etc., then you can go in any number
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.180]   of directions.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.980]   You can go from insurance to investment management, you can go from investment management to banking,
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.020]   you can go from banking to taxes, you can go in any number of directions.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.140]   But you can only do that when you have access to the United States.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.540]   Now I'm not an expert on immigrating to the United States for obvious reasons.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:51.780]   And quite frankly, I don't have a clue what to say to you about U.S. immigration.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.400]   It is the most screwed up system I can possibly imagine.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:02.880]   Just today as we record this, the state of Texas is barring an area on the American border
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:09.420]   with Mexico, keeping out U.S. federal border patrol agents because the border patrol agents
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.420]   are not enforcing immigration laws.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.440]   I don't know what to tell you about anything involved with immigration.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.460]   It is an absolute nightmare system.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:23.900]   And on behalf of all of my people, I apologize to you dramatically because it's an absurd
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.380]   system.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.340]   Quite frankly, sometimes I wonder if a guy like you shouldn't just simply fly to Mexico
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.500]   and come across the border with everyone else.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:38.500]   I recently was interacting with a friend of mine who had some extended family who came
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.460]   across the border using the current asylum system.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.100]   The guy was given a court date in 2027.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:51.080]   And so for the next four years, he came across the border, applied for asylum, and he has
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:57.560]   the ability to stay in the United States for four years until he gets a court date, something
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.600]   like that.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   I don't know what to say.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.540]   It's the craziest system I've ever seen, and I don't know what to say.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.420]   Other than if I were you and I were a young professional, I would not try to go down that
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.100]   path, but I would try to get to the United States as quickly as possible.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.760]   So you need to become an expert first and foremost on how to immigrate to the United
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.900]   States.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:25.180]   My French acquaintances that I met on an airplane that I just described, they were kind of in
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.340]   a similar situation.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.600]   What had happened was they decided they definitely had to get out of France because, quite honestly,
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.360]   the woman got attacked in her apartment by a guy with a machete.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:42.340]   And he got offended at something he said because he's from the religion of peace, and he went
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.880]   into her apartment and he attacked her with a machete.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.560]   Her entire body was covered with these scars.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.840]   She barely escaped with her life because her husband came at that moment and fought the
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.880]   guy off physically in the apartment.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.840]   They were like, "We're getting out of France.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.720]   We're not living this anymore."
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.480]   They applied for the lottery, and the first drawing, they got a lottery slot in the United
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   States.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.600]   And so you should definitely put in an application to the lottery slot because you could win
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   the lottery.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.840]   It does happen.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.160]   On the other hand, there are other pathways.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:22.400]   And so probably there's something related to either education or sponsorship, and those
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.880]   will probably go together.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.320]   And so if you want to move to the United States and you want to pursue financial planning,
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.960]   then you should look for some pathway to study financial planning as a component of your
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   education.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.320]   And increasingly, the field of financial planning is an official academic subject with degrees
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.840]   granted, et cetera, for it, and that might be one pathway.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.280]   Alternatively, you might need to get some form of sponsorship.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.440]   And if you wanted to work as a day-to-day financial planner, generally speaking, you'll
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.840]   have a very hard time finding a company that will sponsor you for that work.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.320]   That's not the kind of industry that sponsors people, generally speaking.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.680]   But there may be something related to it, and so this may be some form of investment
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   analysis that can work, or you might try to find some multinational corporation to work
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   for.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.100]   And that's why I talked about banking.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:17.000]   If you worked for JPMorgan Chase or some other corporation and you work in Frankfurt at their
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.400]   office in Frankfurt, and then later you apply for an international transfer, something like
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.600]   that may work out for you.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   I don't know.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.640]   I'm just giving you ideas.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.040]   But if you know that I want to go to the United States, then getting to the United States,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.300]   getting there with a sponsorship visa so that it allows you to work, and then working your
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.960]   way towards your green card, your permanent residency, that then would allow you to not
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.160]   need sponsorship, that should be your highest priority, and you should basically take any
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.360]   job that gets you in that direction.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.840]   Because then if four years from now you knew that I don't need sponsorship anymore, I have
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.780]   a permanent residency, I can work here, et cetera, you can go in any direction.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.800]   So to me that's a more relevant focus for you than is specifically things like getting
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.280]   a CFP certification, et cetera.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.560]   Now should you do that?
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   Sure.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.880]   But generally speaking, I wouldn't worry about any classes for that at this point in time.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:18.080]   I would just simply focus on building knowledge, studying the content, reading the books, but
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.640]   mainly focusing on what job pathway would get me close to the financial planning industry
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.840]   and also get me into the United States, and then just go from there to the next step.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:38.640]   Thank you for setting my priorities right.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   Anything else?
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.000]   No, that's all.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.840]   And then of course, just keep working on making connections.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:52.280]   So one of the things that you need is you need connections, and so especially coming
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.240]   from abroad, that should be your first goal.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:59.240]   So if you want to go to Texas, then what I would do, the first thing I would do is I
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.800]   would find a Texas group of financial planners, I would find a financial planning conference
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.640]   of some kind that's going to be in Texas or close to Texas, and then go to that conference
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.600]   as a German and start getting advice from people who are around there.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.680]   Reach out to them obviously online, you don't have to physically go there, but reach out
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.960]   to people online, find out is there a company that will sponsor me, what should I be studying,
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.280]   et cetera, and start to get some subject matter experts who can help you and connect you.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.680]   But probably you'll need to qualify yourself for an employment opportunity in a large company
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.720]   that can sponsor you in order to get you there quickly, and then once you have sponsorship,
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   once you eventually can create, get permanent residency, get your green card, then you'll
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.640]   be free of the need to work for any particular company and you can work for anyone else that
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   you want.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.960]   But that's where you'll only know that by speaking to recruiters at firms and find out
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.560]   what they'll actually do.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   We go to the great state of Washington, welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.600]   Is this my number?
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.040]   That's you, whoever you are, that's you.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   Excellent.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   All right, great.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.920]   So going back to, I think it was a great family podcast series you did, you made an offhand
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:10.720]   comment about the so-called social sciences, knowing how we can get happiness.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.600]   I would love to hear your take on that and any books you have.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:21.840]   Is this kind of like the happiness advantage or ... Anyway, I'd love to hear your thinking.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.600]   So my offhand comment was, first of all, that I was a little critical of social sciences
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:33.440]   because I'm frustrated with the replication crisis right now in "social sciences," and
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:39.520]   I think basically ... I used to, in my own mind, equate somebody who was a chemist and
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.640]   somebody who was a psychologist with somehow being on the same par scientifically speaking.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:50.160]   And I've come to since believe that most social sciences, we should find some other name to
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:37:00.480]   rebrand them to create kind of a hard distinction between real, replicatable, consistent, verifiable
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:09.520]   science and observations and theories about how the human brain works, et cetera.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:17.320]   With regard to kind of what we know, certainly there are books that talk about happiness.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.640]   I don't have any record ... I've flipped through a couple here and there, but I have not made
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.960]   a deep search for it.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:30.840]   Probably just from kind of an a priori religious conviction that I don't think that happiness
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:37.040]   is a goal that really can ever be achieved or is a worthwhile goal.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:43.760]   In my own thinking, my own ideology, my own mental ease, I draw a distinction between
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:51.600]   happiness and joy and contentment, and I define those as distinct things.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:58.440]   And I believe that happiness is the least important of those, and happiness is a fickle
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:07.920]   and elusive thing that probably can't be achieved when focused on, but rather is more of a general
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.460]   outcome from a set of actions.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.760]   And so I myself don't have any commentary to make on happiness, because I don't believe
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:24.120]   that happiness is something particularly worth pursuing.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.600]   That's not to say that I'm not happy.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   I am happy.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.080]   But if I'm not happy, if I wake up one day and I'm happy, and I wake up the next day
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:39.760]   and I'm not happy, I don't see why I should give any weight to the presence of the emotions
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.480]   of happiness or the lack of presence of emotions of happiness, except in just a general observational
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   form so I can notice how I'm feeling.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.240]   But there can be any number of reasons why I may or may not feel happy on a daily basis.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:39:00.440]   And so I've avoided a lot of that literature myself, like in terms of just trying to dig
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.800]   into it, other than just a passing interest.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:09.240]   I've taken interest in the research on income levels and the self-reported happiness of
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.440]   people who earn a certain amount of money, which definitely shows that you want to earn
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.680]   a good amount of money to get yourself out of poverty, but there's significant diminishing
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.240]   returns after that point in time.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.780]   The social science I'm most aware of has to do with basically stability in life and connectedness
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.080]   with other people.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   And so I'm primarily interested in that as I have tested my own religious convictions.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:43.520]   And what you find, for example, is that people who are married report consistently higher
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.440]   experiences of generalized happiness than people who are unmarried.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.720]   And I'm inclined to predispose to want to believe that because I have chosen the path
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.440]   of marriage.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.120]   People who have children generally find that they're a great source of children.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.480]   People who are connected in a close social community, a religious community, report much
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.320]   more happiness, etc.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.560]   So I don't have any more of a detailed answer than that, other than to say that these things
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:16.120]   are studied and I have not found any research from the scientific space that has ever led
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.860]   me to question the decisions that I have made in life.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:24.800]   Every time that I've questioned a decision, so for example, years ago I had a friend of
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.660]   mine who was a player and he had pursued a very different path than mine.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.760]   I've been with one woman, he'd been with a bazillion.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.960]   I'm married, he's not, and we have a good relationship and talked it through, etc.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.880]   And those kinds of things I always test.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:47.000]   I always test my own decisions, my own things, and just try to get a sense.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.800]   And as an example, we're going through it, and his answer was, "None of this has paid
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   off for me.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.700]   I thought that it was something that I wanted.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.300]   It seemed like the pathway to happiness, pure hedonistic fulfillment, sexual adventures
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.080]   left, right, and center, etc., and it hasn't turned out.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.640]   It hasn't turned out."
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:14.580]   And so things like that are things that I think that we should understand and then teach
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:19.760]   to our children because we know that they're true.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.200]   Other things, like things like pornography.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:27.060]   When I was younger, my generation, our parents were caught completely unaware by the rise
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.120]   of internet pornography.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.580]   And I was addicted to internet pornography for years, and as a component of that, I studied
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.080]   the topic out.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:41.720]   And what's so interesting to me is the thing that seems like it's going to bring happiness,
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:47.440]   meaning immediate sexual gratification, is the thing that ultimately destroys happiness.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:53.520]   And so I am very well equipped in my conversation with my children, I am very well equipped
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:03.880]   today to have a very careful conversation about pornography because of the clear, not
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:10.800]   only a religious conviction and a moral and ethical conviction about mistreatment of women,
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.940]   etc., but also just from a clear psychological perspective and a physiological perspective.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:20.560]   And so when I talk to teens about pornography, I just say, "Do you want erectile dysfunction?
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.400]   If so, this is your pathway."
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.480]   And so if you want to be on Viagra when you're 20 years old, then use pornography.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.160]   And so things like that, to me, are an important component of what we should know and what
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.080]   we should be studying and what we should be equipped for to teach our children the truth
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.480]   about these things.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.080]   And so those are the things that mostly interest me.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:45.360]   Family, religious community, a sense of purpose in the world, those physical, physiological
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:52.880]   things that result in our experiencing greater daily levels of happiness, sunshine, exercise,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   water, good food, good relationships, a sense of purpose, etc.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.000]   That's as far as I could go.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.840]   And from there, I'll refer you to, I don't know, Andrew Huberman.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.600]   Call him and ask him.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.600]   Okay.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.600]   Sounds good.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   Anything else?
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   Thank you.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.680]   Pushing, well, on this topic, do you have more callers?
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   How many more do you have?
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   Go ahead.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   Go ahead.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:20.280]   Pushing back a little bit, maybe a year or two ago, you had a very helpful podcast on
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.680]   what you do on down days and how you reset your mind and so on.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:31.000]   It seems like happiness isn't necessarily a good goal, but happiness is definitely impactful
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.360]   when I have a bleak day and I don't see color.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.160]   Everything is gray and black or gray and white, and it does really impact things.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.040]   So it's not necessarily a goal, but it seems like it's more than just, "Oh, am I happy?
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.240]   Am I not happy?"
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   No, you're right.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.240]   You're right.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.640]   And I have a lot of black days.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:44:01.960]   And so part of my, I have learned over the years that I'm an extremely emotional guy.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.880]   I've always admired people who were just steady state all the time, et cetera.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.360]   I'm not that way.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:12.920]   And so like many emotional people, I experienced the euphoric highs and I experienced the black
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.720]   lows.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:20.640]   And when I was younger, I thought that there was going to be some kind of like, "If only
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.720]   if I can just achieve this thing, then all the blackness will go away.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.640]   I won't have any black days."
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.960]   That was what I expected when I was younger.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.240]   I don't expect that anymore.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   And so part of what I said about happiness is just part of my own personal philosophy,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.200]   where when I question the idea that should the way that I feel make any difference in
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:50.480]   what I do, I believe that I'm master of my mind and I can make the choice that the way
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:55.640]   that I feel doesn't need to affect what I do.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.400]   And I find that where I'm most capable of this is in how I treat other people.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.780]   So for example, I'm married, I have children.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:11.720]   And so how I feel on a today should not affect how I treat those that I love.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.560]   They're not responsible for how I feel.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.700]   And so there's no question that it may affect me if I'm tired, if I'm cranky, if I'm having
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.880]   a black day or a black week or a black month.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:27.560]   I have had some black months this year, last year, sorry, 2023 was for me an extremely
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.080]   difficult year.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:33.000]   And you talk about it and you're like, "Why should it be difficult?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   It shouldn't be difficult."
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.960]   I had a lot of peak experiences, but I had months of blackness, just feeling like imprisoned
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.080]   in the black cell.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.400]   And it was hard, right?
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:54.440]   But at the end of the day, I believe that I still have to control how I act.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:00.760]   And so I may not, when I'm experiencing that, I may not as naturally as I would like to
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:07.840]   express those, like, I mean, it may not be as easy for me to laugh with my children and
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.160]   to treat my wife with gentleness and kindness and be effusive, et cetera.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.240]   When I'm feeling black, then it's hard to do that.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.760]   But the fact that it's hard to do that doesn't mean that I have an option, I still need to
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   treat them.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.440]   I can't raise my voice, I can't raise my hands, I can't do something that's going to cause
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.440]   that.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.400]   All I know from having lived for a while is that the blackness comes and go.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.800]   We have good days and bad days, and they come and go, and that I can make a choice each
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.040]   and every day in what I do to a significant degree.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.880]   So definitely all that stuff matters.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.840]   The thing that I said in that old podcast of the basic things are things that I try
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.840]   to do.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.560]   So I'll just reprise them very quickly.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.520]   Here are some of the things that I try to pay attention to.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.300]   Number one, am I sleeping?
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.960]   And so sleep is sacrosanct.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.900]   And sleep is driven by, I have to go to bed.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.560]   That is the key decision.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:07.160]   So I do not stay up late, I never stay up late, I'm not allowed to stay up late, I have
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.880]   to turn everything off, and I have to go to bed, and I need to be in bed no matter what.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.240]   Because if I go to bed and I get to bed by 10 o'clock, I shoot for 9 o'clock, then I'll
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.120]   naturally wake up at 5 o'clock, I don't have an alarm clock, I have a few minutes before
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.280]   the day gets started, and that forms the foundation.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.680]   Movement is another thing.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.680]   I have to move.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.520]   If I don't move, if I don't get my 10,000 steps, if I don't walk, if I don't exercise,
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.600]   then I don't feel good.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.280]   And movement is a way of changing state.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:39.040]   I despise with a passion doing Tony Robbins exercises of changing your physical state
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.160]   by some jumping around, but there's no question in my mind that it works.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.180]   So I just don't want to do it, because sometimes I don't want to do it, but there's no question
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:52.440]   that you can change your physical state, your emotional state by your body.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.380]   And so knowing that we can control our emotions by our body is really important.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.560]   Sunshine is a really important thing, vitamin D, et cetera, getting sunshine exposure, and
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.240]   then making sure that we're eating well and that we have good relationships, that we have
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.620]   a sense of purpose.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:15.680]   And then I've tried to do my best to overcome the blackness by having some productive things
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.880]   that I can do when I don't feel like doing anything.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.800]   And so I look at it as basically a gradation of choices.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:31.020]   So maybe choice, here's the optimal choice if I were a man of iron discipline would be
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.560]   to do thing A, but if I can't do thing A, let me have a thing B that's not quite so
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.320]   hard to do, but it's still going to give me positive outcomes.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   So instead of sitting around and sitting on the couch and, I don't know, watching Netflix
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.960]   or something, let me go for a walk, because at least walking is pretty easy.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:53.040]   And if I go for a walk, even if I just waste the time or listen to something that's educational,
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.520]   if I come back in an hour, I'll probably feel better when I come back in an hour than not.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.840]   So maybe I was too strong in saying I don't happiness.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:06.280]   I aspire to ignore how I feel, because I don't think that how I feel, looking to that as
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.240]   some kind of ongoing cue is a smart way to live.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.600]   I shouldn't love my wife because I'd feel loving towards her.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.920]   I love my wife because it's an act of the will, not based upon how I feel.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.200]   And so I aspire to do the same thing with happiness, which is why I gave that macho
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   answer to begin with.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   What do you think?
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.880]   What's your perspective on it?
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   Nope.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   That makes sense.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.880]   As far as how I feel is important for how I experience things, but how I feel should
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.000]   not impact how I live going forward.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.800]   As you said, how I love my wife and my daughter shouldn't be impacted by how I'm feeling.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.040]   I do those because it's right.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.120]   So yeah, that makes sense.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.760]   Just this morning, I think there's more things that we can learn.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.760]   So here's one.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.960]   Here's a book I haven't read, but I took some notes on it from a book summary.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:01.120]   But there was a book called The Winner Effect, and this was just this morning I was looking
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.120]   into this.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.840]   And one of the things that I think is really interesting that evidently is talked about
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:19.480]   in that book is how early wins that someone has makes a big difference in their long-term
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.560]   performance.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:26.820]   So we know, for example, that professional athletes have a very strong skew towards being
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:31.080]   born in January, February, March, et cetera, because that means that they were always the
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.960]   biggest and the fastest players on the team just because they were the biggest and fastest
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.620]   players on the team.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.880]   That led to them doing things they felt good about, having wins, racking up those wins,
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.080]   has some influence on who they ultimately become.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:49.720]   And what's really interesting about that is the guy I was listening to made the comment.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:58.600]   And he said this, "Is it ever effective to feel like you lost?"
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.440]   And I've tried for years to embrace the idea of sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.380]   I have embraced that to a high degree.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.680]   But one of the things that I have thought about, even just this morning, is that is
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.600]   there any point in negative feelings?
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.760]   I was talking with a friend of mine, friends of mine who are parents, and we're talking
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   about shame.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.840]   We weren't talking about it with regard to children, although it affects children.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   We were talking about it in relationships.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:32.220]   And the conversation that we're having is, is it ever appropriate to try to inflict shame
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.480]   on somebody?
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.280]   And I don't know the answer to that.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.320]   I'm still thinking about that.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:45.600]   And so as an outlay of that, just this morning, I was thinking about, is it ever effective
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.760]   to feel like you lost in some way or to feel like a loser?
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.120]   Does that matter?
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.640]   And I guess if I were to try to answer that question, I would say that, sure, there are
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:00.200]   some people who thrive on the hatred that they determine from losing.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.760]   But you yourself, like, don't beat yourself up about things.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.520]   And so I do wonder, and this is a question that you're inspiring, and I'm rambling a
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.700]   little bit, so I'm going to wrap it up.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:16.920]   But I do wonder, like, how many of the black days are just due to our beating ourselves
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.160]   up over things?
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:23.280]   And the older I get, the more I realize the worthlessness of negative emotions or of really
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.920]   assigning any kind of weight to certain things.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.840]   An example, like dieting, right?
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.720]   I've been fat for years.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:34.360]   And so dieters, people who are yo-yo dieters, as I have been, you get this, there's just
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:39.520]   this strange tendency that someone says, "Well, I cheated on my diet because I went to a party
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.080]   and I wasn't supposed to eat carbohydrates and ate carbohydrates at the party."
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.820]   And then two weeks later, they're chowing down pizza every day.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:51.280]   And what I've realized over the years with lots of failures where I assigned all kinds
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.840]   of negative emotions to that is there's just no point to any of those negative emotions.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   So I screwed it up.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.480]   All right, no big deal.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.520]   If I just brush that off and say, "I'm human, and so what?
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.960]   It was a party and I felt like eating carbohydrates," and then the next day, I don't have any of
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.480]   the negative emotions associated with it, then I can just go right back on, I'm right
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.640]   back on the wagon, and no one ever dies.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:16.800]   No one's diet is ever destroyed by one meal of eating something that wasn't on your diet
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   plan.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.640]   And so that is something that I am thinking about.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:26.280]   And I do wonder the effect of those negative emotions, the things, the stories we tell
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.200]   ourselves where we tell ourselves we've failed or we've lost or we could have done better
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.040]   or should have done better, all the shoulda, shoulda, shoulda stuff, I do wonder the impact
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.120]   of that on happiness, but I don't have any answers.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.760]   So there we should look to social science and try to understand some of those answers
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   from them.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   Interesting.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   Thank you.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.760]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.440]   Thank you for calling, and I feel like I gave you two answers.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.160]   The macho one is what I aspire to.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:57.480]   The real one is that, you know, we all face it, but I do think that we should try to,
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.280]   there's no reason, if we can do something that's going to improve our mental state,
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   why not?
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.040]   But at the end of the day, it shouldn't be something that drives us.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.240]   I think I'm picking up the right- I gotcha.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.240]   Okay.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:14.160]   Well, let's just, I want to make sure I got this right.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.320]   All right.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.800]   That caller is on the other line, so we'll just hang on one second and see if she can
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.200]   get finished up.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.760]   Okay.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.520]   Robin, thank you so much for your help.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   I really appreciate it.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.600]   I'll go ahead and get this set right over.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.600]   Have a great day.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   You're welcome.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   Thank you.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   Bye-bye.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.080]   Are you with us now, ma'am?
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.600]   Did you- Ma'am, are you there from Washington State?
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   That's you.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.840]   I don't know your name.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.960]   We go to Washington State.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.360]   Are you there, ma'am?
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:05.760]   All right, well, 360 Area Code, are you there?
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.920]   Our previous caller was from Washington, but it sounds like she's not going to be able
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   to be there.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   All right.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.720]   So that concludes our podcast for today.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.120]   Thank you so much, everyone, for being here.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.880]   Thank you for your interesting questions.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.320]   I guess Josh was becoming, I don't know, some form of life coach and career coach because
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.840]   he didn't give me any hard financial questions.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:30.360]   It makes it easy for me, but I got to keep my chops up as a financial planner, et cetera.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.900]   So don't forget that if you've got a financial planning question or something, I always do
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.000]   my shows with my calculator right here, so I'm ready to go.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.800]   You don't have to just give me these softball questions, although, of course, I do enjoy
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.720]   talking about this stuff and I think it does matter.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.600]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:51.640]   If you'd like to join me next week, remember, go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.040]   and we will look forward to...
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   Actually, hold on.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.040]   Hold on.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   No.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.040]   I'll just skip that question for now.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.700]   Thank you so much.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.280]   (upbeat music)
