[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.320]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.920]   My guest today is Dr. Roger Schwelt.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.720]   Dr. Roger Schwelt is a board certified medical doctor
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.080]   in pulmonology,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.040]   which is the understanding and treatment of conditions
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.880]   that impact the respiratory system,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.480]   such as colds, flus, and other viruses,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.800]   mold infections, asthma, and more.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.040]   Dr. Schwelt is also board certified in sleep medicine.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.320]   He does his clinical work
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.120]   in the intensive care unit at Loma Linda University,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.480]   and he's actively involved
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.640]   in medical and public health education
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.560]   through his terrific online channel called MedCram.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.600]   Today, we discuss how to avoid getting colds,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.400]   flus, and other viruses,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.640]   and how to treat them to minimize discomfort,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.920]   accelerate healing, and avoid long-term consequences.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.560]   During today's episode, we discuss long COVID,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.360]   as well as the use of sun and red light
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.300]   to stimulate mitochondrial and therefore metabolic health
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.200]   across the entire brain and body.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.720]   That opens up a broader discussion about phototherapy,
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.920]   which is the use of light to control health,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800]   and temperature and other levers
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.280]   for improving brain and bodily function.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.800]   Dr. Schwelt emphasizes that sun and red light therapy
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.280]   have a long and well-established medical history,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.800]   and their mechanisms of action are known,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.720]   and therefore it's not just biohacking as many people think.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.120]   We also discuss the sometimes controversial topic
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.960]   of the flu shot, and if and when you should get one.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.840]   Dr. Schwelt, as you'll soon hear,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.240]   is world-class at making medical concepts
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480]   and the actionable items related to health
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   exceptionally clear.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.640]   As a consequence, I'm certain that you'll truly appreciate
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.680]   the knowledge that he shares in your efforts
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.160]   to be and stay healthy at any age.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.140]   In fact, by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.120]   you'll be armed with the real knowledge
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.120]   on how to best get over nasty infections
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.360]   of the sinuses, lungs, and throat faster,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.720]   should you happen to get one,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.760]   and even better, how to avoid them altogether.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.600]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.240]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.400]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   to bring zero-cost to consumer information
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.500]   to the general public.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.780]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.200]   this episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.380]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Roger Schwelt.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.600]   Dr. Roger Schwelt, welcome.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.220]   - Thank you so much, Andrew, for having me.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.240]   - I discovered you because you were putting out
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.360]   and continue to put out incredible information
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.240]   about how to stay healthy amidst infectious diseases,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.840]   airborne infectious diseases,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   skin contact-based infectious diseases, and on and on.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.080]   And nobody likes to be sick.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.880]   And you've provided me tremendously valuable information
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.140]   about how to avoid getting sick,
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.600]   and in many cases, how to accelerate the progression
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.800]   from sick to healthy again.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.640]   It's been tremendously helpful
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.800]   for getting me back into life, as it were.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.480]   Let's talk about some of the things that one can do
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.560]   to avoid getting sick
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.960]   when in the presence of airborne viruses,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.760]   in particular, colds and flus, and other viruses, as it were.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.360]   If you were to think about the major pillars
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.000]   of remaining healthy,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.560]   especially when one is exposed to colds and flus from kids,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.800]   in your case, also in the intensive care unit
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.120]   where people are coming in specifically
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.280]   because they're sick,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.360]   often with infections like colds and flus or worse,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.200]   you need to take specific precautions
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.500]   to avoid getting sick.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.120]   What do you think of as the fundamental layer
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.240]   of keeping a healthy immune system to avoid getting sick?
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.640]   And then we'll talk about how to get over
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   and move through being sick more quickly.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.840]   - Yes.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.800]   Well, the question is how do you avoid getting sick
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   in terms of infectious diseases?
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.680]   And as it turns out,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.720]   the answer to that is actually the same
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.480]   in terms of avoiding getting sick for anything.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.380]   And it sort of goes to the pillars, as you call it.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.640]   In my mind, there's actually a physician
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.000]   that I know very well,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.160]   just outside of Stanford, actually,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.880]   in a place called Weimar,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.720]   Weimar University, Dr. Neil Nedley.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   And he's actually coined this mnemonic called Neustart.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.120]   And each of those letters, to me in my mind,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.080]   is something that I go to when I want to improve health
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.280]   in people in general.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.320]   So the N starts for nutrition.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.740]   And we can talk about nutrition
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.540]   and what that does to the human body.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.100]   Obviously, as natural as possible,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.780]   staying away from processed foods.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.240]   That's something there.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.260]   Exercise is E.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.020]   And when I'm talking about exercise,
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.600]   I'm talking about the understanding
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   that we have regarding exercise,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.360]   not to build muscle, necessarily be stronger.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.280]   I'm talking about exercise in terms of health.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.260]   And that has more of a J-hook type of picture.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.800]   What I mean by J-hook is,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.600]   if you're not doing any exercise,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.400]   you're gonna have higher levels of inflammation.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.640]   As soon as you start to do some exercise,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.720]   even mild to moderate exercise,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.820]   the amount of inflammation in your body starts to come down.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.160]   But as you start to do more and more exercise,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.800]   you do have to be careful in terms of your general health.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.320]   This is exactly what happens with athletes.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.400]   They have to be very careful
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.240]   that when they're doing that type of elite athletic exercise
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   that they're not sick on the day of performance.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.320]   And so that's an issue.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.940]   So I'm referring to just mild to moderate exercise is good.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.020]   The next one would be W, water.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.720]   So this is something that's really interesting.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.520]   Obviously, it seems pretty obvious,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.600]   but not only the use of internal water, but external water.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.940]   So in that area, we can talk about sauna, cold plunge,
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.780]   things of that nature
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.520]   that can actually help with our immune system.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.280]   That's a whole interesting area of discussion.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.960]   It involves the innate immune system.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.640]   It involves interferon.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.960]   There's a lot of history and data
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.600]   that goes back over 100 years on how that's been used.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.480]   Start, S-T-A-R-T.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.640]   So S is sunlight.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.120]   I've been a real proponent
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.840]   of getting people outside into the sun,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.000]   and we can talk a lot about that.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.500]   There's a lot of interesting research,
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.140]   not only in terms of sunlight, in terms of influenza,
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.320]   but also COVID, and just about any natural disease.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.640]   A lot of interesting information there.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.520]   T, T stands for the old term called temperance,
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.720]   which you may recall is a term that we use
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.760]   to prevent us from taking in toxins into our body.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.440]   That's a whole 'nother discussion.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.920]   So staying away from things that would make you sick.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.920]   A is air, and when I talk about air,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.800]   it's not just what we focus on,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.520]   which is keeping bad things out of the air,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.920]   so having fresh air,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.120]   but there's a whole discussion to be had
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.760]   in terms of air that has good qualities in it.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.520]   So there's a whole area of research that looks at,
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.800]   for instance, phytoncides,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.320]   which are chemicals that come off of trees.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.880]   You may have heard of forest bathing.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.640]   They've done a lot of research in Japan on this,
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.020]   and getting out into nature,
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.480]   there are actual chemicals that are in the air
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   that you can breathe that actually have an impact
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.000]   on your innate immune system.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.440]   Finally, R, and we'll get into R and T at the end.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.600]   R is rest.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.080]   Now, this goes without saying,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.840]   but people who have good sleep habits
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.480]   are gonna have much better immune systems,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.120]   whether you're talking about
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.480]   the antibody response after a vaccine
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.180]   versus just the number of times per year you're sick.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.360]   There's very good data, very good research
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.480]   that shows that getting seven, eight hours of sleep a night
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.640]   is gonna be very beneficial for your immune system.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.820]   It has to do with cortisol and beta receptors
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.400]   and all sorts of things.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.840]   And the last T, which is trust,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.360]   and for some, it is trust in a higher power,
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.700]   trust in God.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.780]   These are the sorts of things
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.320]   that can help us relieve stress.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.440]   If someone else is helping you, if someone else is there,
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.760]   T would also include community, people that are around you.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.600]   These are some of the less tangible ways of measuring it.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.120]   But when someone asks me a question,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.920]   what can I do to avoid getting sick?
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.960]   And as you just asked me in terms of influenza,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.640]   there's a lot of specific things we can talk about,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.480]   but that's where I start out with the pillars of health.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.140]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor Juve.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.440]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.280]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.820]   that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.280]   it is the incredible impact
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.320]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.560]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.880]   red light and near infrared light sources
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.720]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.460]   on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health,
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.360]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.520]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.740]   improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.000]   even mitochondrial function and improving vision itself.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.320]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.880]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy device
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.920]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.180]   meaning specific wavelengths of red light
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.380]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.160]   to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.320]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.880]   about three to four times a week,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.740]   and I use the Juve handheld light
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.920]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.020]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.860]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.700]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.380]   to all Huberman Lab listeners

[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.500]   Again, that's juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.480]   to get up to $400 off.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.240]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.800]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.420]   with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.980]   Now, I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.180]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.920]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.220]   Now, one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.700]   is to ensure that the temperature
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.780]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.900]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.720]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.380]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.980]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.140]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.700]   about one to three degrees.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.980]   Eight Sleep makes it very easy
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.420]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.220]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.820]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.780]   middle and end of the night.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.580]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.860]   for nearly four years now and it has completely transformed
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.820]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.100]   Eight Sleep recently launched their newest generation
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.940]   of the pod cover called the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.980]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.000]   I find that very useful because I like to make the bed
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.620]   really cool at the beginning of the night,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.460]   even colder in the middle of the night and warm as I wake up.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.460]   That's what gives me the most slow wave sleep
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.660]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.340]   It also has snoring detection
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.500]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.060]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.220]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.620]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.160]   to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.740]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.260]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.360]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.540]   - Let's start off with one of my favorite topics
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.660]   would be the S in New Start.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.960]   Let's talk about sunlight.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.520]   Listeners of this podcast
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.580]   or anyone that's heard me on social media
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.100]   know that I'm as big a proponent
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.180]   of getting morning sunlight in one's eyes
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.820]   as one could possibly be
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.300]   without repeating himself 10 million times per year.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.020]   It's a daily activity that we just know
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.940]   has such an outsized positive effect
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.380]   on the whole setting of the circadian rhythm
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.880]   and thereby improved daytime mood focus
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.700]   and alertness in nighttime sleep.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.380]   But the way you describe sunlight,
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.220]   it goes beyond just getting morning sunlight in one's eyes.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.680]   So if we want to parse this S, sunlight, in New Start,
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.120]   how are you thinking about sunlight?
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.380]   Is it sunlight on the skin?
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.400]   Is it also midday light, not just morning sunlight?
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.060]   Is it a certain amount of sunlight?
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.380]   And then maybe we can also talk about
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.260]   some of the underlying mechanisms.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.820]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.540]   So when you talk about sunlight, and I'm a big believer,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.340]   I'm board certified in sleep medicine
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.500]   and I'm cheering you on when you talk about these things
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.340]   'cause it's so important that light into the retina
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.500]   does have an effect on the circadian rhythm,
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.820]   super chiasmatic nucleus.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.580]   It does have an effect on mood,
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.940]   goes to the perihabendular nucleus in the brain
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.020]   and has an effect there.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.180]   Those are well-known and very important.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.400]   What I'm talking about when I'm talking about sunlight
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   is an aspect of light that is not very well-known
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.200]   in terms of its visible effects.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.620]   So we know about the visible effects of light.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.480]   These are photons that are coming into the eyes,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.760]   that we can see.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.900]   What I'm discussing and what I'm talking about
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.260]   is the effect of sunlight on the human body,
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.500]   the skin penetrating into the human body.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.220]   Now this at first sounds kind of woo-woo, I guess,
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.220]   we could say, but the point that I wanna make here
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.580]   is understanding that when we look at the sun,
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.220]   we are seeing about 38% of that energy
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.020]   coming from the sun is in the visible spectrum.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.320]   There's a whole nother 52% of the photons
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.820]   coming from the sun in the infrared spectrum.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.980]   And on the other end, on the ultraviolet side,
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.560]   this is the part we have no problem understanding
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.220]   because we know that ultraviolet B light
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.460]   comes into our skin and it's high energy,
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.100]   so it's able to actually move the bonds
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.440]   on these cholesterol derivatives in order to make vitamin D.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.280]   So we know that.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.580]   So now what do we say?
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.820]   When I say, "Hey, I wanna go outside to get some vitamin D,"
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.140]   we know that we're going outside
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.180]   to get this light that we can't see
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.820]   that's very imperative to giving us
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.900]   something called vitamin D,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.700]   which is a hormone in our body,
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.280]   and it's very, very important.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.900]   On the other side of that, though,
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.020]   on the infrared side, is something that there's new science,
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.900]   new data that is coming out that is showing
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.580]   that it's actually very, very important.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.640]   And to that, I would point to an article
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.900]   that really changed my thinking on this
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.460]   and really opened my eyes, no pun intended.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.260]   There was an article that was published in 2019
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.180]   in Melatonin Research by Scott Zimmerman and Russell Ryder.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.140]   And the name of that article was
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.820]   Melatonin, Optics of the Human Body,
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.940]   the Optics of the Human Body.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.380]   And what Scott Zimmerman and Russell Ryder set out to show
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.300]   is that, in fact, infrared light,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.100]   because of its very long wavelength,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.780]   it can penetrate through into the skin actually very deep.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.060]   And we're not talking about
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.340]   how long a path length goes through.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.500]   You have to remember that this type of long wavelength
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.380]   can scatter, and it can scatter throughout up to,
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.120]   they say, up to eight centimeters,
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.960]   according to this data.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.060]   - A single photon.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.880]   - A single photon can bounce around.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.980]   It's a very low-energy photon.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.640]   But low-energy photons, because they're very long
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.820]   in wavelength, can penetrate very deeply.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.540]   A good way of thinking about this is, you know,
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.580]   you pull up to a stop sign, and a car pulls up next to you,
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.220]   and they're playing this really loud music, right?
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.580]   What do you hear in your car?
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.000]   It's very low-frequency sound.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.780]   And the reason why that's what you hear
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.540]   is because low-frequency sound
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.980]   is the only kind of sound coming out of that guy's radio
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.520]   that's able to penetrate not only his car,
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.880]   but go into your car and shake the steering wheel
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.900]   on your car.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.300]   It's the same thing, like, for instance,
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.640]   if you were to go to the Grand Canyon,
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.660]   and there's a storm coming, storm very far away,
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.500]   what's the first thing that you're gonna hear?
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.700]   It's low rumbling.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.660]   It's because that low-frequency energy
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.460]   is able to penetrate very deeply.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.820]   There's a astrophysicist in Europe,
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   in England, actually, Bob Fosbury.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.300]   He sent me a photograph of his hand
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.220]   in front of a infrared light source.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.740]   And it was almost like the first guy
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.860]   who took an X-ray of his hand, Rotigen,
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.460]   I guess is his name, and he said, he looked at his hand,
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.360]   he says, "I almost, like, saw my own death,"
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.240]   'cause he could see the bones in his hand through the X-ray.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.440]   Well, Bob Fosbury, who's at the European Space Agency
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.160]   and is well-tuned into this type of understanding,
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   he put his hand in front of a infrared light sensor,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.400]   or infrared light source,
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.500]   and took a infrared light photograph.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.800]   And the light comes through the hand.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.320]   It illuminates the entire hand.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.060]   And this is, of course, a lot more than a few millimeters.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.120]   And the mind-blowing thing about it was
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.960]   you could not see any bones.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.080]   It was either penetrating through the bone,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.200]   or it was going around the bone.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.400]   And very clearly, you could see that infrared light
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.240]   is able to go much more than just skin deep.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.040]   It penetrates through your clothes.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.120]   You can actually test this out on a summer day,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.520]   or even on a winter day, if the sun is out.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.440]   Wear a few layers of clothing, go outside, close your eyes,
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.320]   and move around and see if you can feel where the sun is.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.440]   You can.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.720]   And the reason is is because it's that infrared radiation
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.840]   that's able to penetrate through the clothes,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.160]   penetrate through your skin,
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   actually activate the heat sensors in your body,
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.880]   and actually go much deeper than that.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.040]   That's actually in a straight line.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.920]   After it does that, it hits something,
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.360]   and then it bounces around a couple of more times,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.000]   maybe a few hundred more times.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.640]   And so the point of that paper,
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.460]   "The Optics of the Human Body,"
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.800]   is that we have this understanding or this idea
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   that light simply hits our skin, and that's where it ends.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.840]   And that's not the case.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.320]   Why that's important is because of the effect
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.680]   of this type of infrared light has on mitochondria.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.000]   And that's really the mind-blowing aspect of this,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   is that mitochondria are like engines in your cells, right?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.240]   They're like engines in your car.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.760]   The engine in your car burns fuel, makes locomotion,
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.160]   and in the process of making that locomotion,
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.200]   it creates heat.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   And that heat, if not dealt with, can shut down your engine.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.520]   Well, in the mitochondria, you've got this process occurring
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.480]   making ATP, which is basically
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.800]   the currency of energy in the cell.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.720]   And in the process of doing this, it makes oxidative stress,
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.760]   oxidative reactive oxygen species.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.280]   If you don't deal with those reactive oxygen species,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   that could shut down the mitochondria.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   And quite truly, just about every single chronic disease
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.200]   that we have in this country, whether it's diabetes,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.400]   hypertension, heart disease, dementia, all of those,
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.000]   they all have at the root of them mitochondrial dysfunction.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.160]   And this goes to a much bigger picture
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.880]   of the mitochondrial theory of aging.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.480]   We know that after 40 years, the output of mitochondria,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.800]   which is ATP, drops by about 70%.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.600]   - Seven zero? - Seven zero.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.000]   Can you imagine being in your house
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.360]   and somehow the energy production to your house
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.200]   drops by 70%?
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.600]   Can you imagine what an impact that would have
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.760]   on just about every function that goes on in your house?
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.200]   This is exactly what's happening in the cell.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.680]   And so what does this have to do with sunlight?
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.480]   Well, here's what they've shown,
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.760]   that the mitochondria actually make on-site melatonin
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.960]   in orders of magnitude higher concentration
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.640]   than is made in the pineal gland.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.040]   - Really? - Yes.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.120]   So they've actually done the work where they have serotonin.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.640]   They are actually labeling the carbons in serotonin
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.760]   and showing that that melatonin
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.280]   in orders of magnitude higher concentration
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.960]   are being made on-site in the mitochondria.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.480]   - Okay, I have to ask about this.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.120]   - Yes. - Most people, including me,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.120]   are familiar with melatonin secretion
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.960]   from the pineal gland. - Correct.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.480]   - Being suppressed by light
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.720]   via some neural circuit pathways
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.800]   that go from eye to suprachiasmatic nucleus
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.360]   to there's a circuitous loop to the brainstem
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.260]   and then up to the pineal.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.320]   So light suppresses melatonin release from the pineal.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.840]   We know that. - Yes.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.840]   - In that context, melatonin is the hormone of darkness
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.400]   and causes sleepiness. - Correct.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.880]   - What is the role of melatonin
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.840]   in the context that you are describing?
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   Because if indeed infrared and other long wavelength light
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.080]   is causing the production of melatonin
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.400]   from the mitochondria in the rest of the body,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.920]   I'm assuming that's not to increase
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.960]   our levels of sleepiness. - That is correct.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.280]   - And I do know that melatonin is a powerful antioxidant.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.640]   - Yes. - So I'm guessing
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.440]   that next you're gonna tell me that it is combating
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.600]   the reactive oxygen species that are produced
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.440]   as a function of mitochondrial metabolism.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.560]   - Absolutely. - Okay.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.440]   - Absolutely.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.680]   So the mitochondria make melatonin on-site.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.840]   This is not being secreted into the blood.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.560]   It's being used on-site.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.640]   So this is not being used as a secondary messenger
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.020]   to tell the body anything about circadian rhythm.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.040]   This is a extremely powerful, as you know,
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.880]   extremely powerful antioxidant.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.160]   It's actually one of the most powerful antioxidants
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.000]   in the human body.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.320]   It actually up-regulates the glutathione system
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.240]   by regulation.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   So what this melatonin does is it's able to mop up
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.560]   these reactive oxygen species.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.240]   Let's back up a little bit there.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.000]   Reactive oxygen species, what are they?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.720]   So if you, let's get nerdy, let's get into the details.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.640]   In the mitochondria, the way it works
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.120]   is that you burn fuels.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   You burn carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.280]   And as a result of that, you make these very reduced agents,
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.900]   NADH, FADH2.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.480]   They go to the electron transport chain.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.040]   And just as the Colorado River,
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.240]   as it goes down through various different dams
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.200]   and then dumps out into the Gulf of California,
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.680]   the same thing happens with these very highly charged
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.280]   and electronegative electrons.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.920]   They, as they start to fall down
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.760]   and get transferred from one enzyme to another,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.600]   they cause the out-production or the out-transfer
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.200]   of protons into the inner membrane space.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.520]   The problem is, though, is when you finally get done
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.640]   with these electrons, they've been completely spent.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   There's nothing else to accept them.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.400]   And the only thing that can actually do that
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.200]   is something so electronegative
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.880]   that it would actually take these electrons,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.400]   and that's oxygen.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.080]   And that's the reason why we breathe oxygen.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.680]   It's because we need an electron acceptor
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.100]   for these spent electrons.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.800]   It's very near and dear to my heart as a pulmonologist,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.880]   a critical care specialist.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.960]   We need to have oxygen.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.180]   If you don't have oxygen, things shut down very quickly.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.240]   - For those that aren't familiar
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.280]   with these biochemical pathways,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.920]   maybe one way for them to think about it
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   is that free electrons are not a good thing in this system.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.600]   You don't want electrons floating around.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.380]   And in these biochemical steps that convert energy
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.160]   into the stuff that cells can use more readily to move
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.700]   and do everything that we do, electrons are kicked off.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.600]   Oxygen can work with those free electrons.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.680]   I'm trying to use language here
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   that divorces us from the classic biochemical pathways
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.360]   so that more people can grasp it,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.880]   'cause it's really a beautiful mechanism.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.280]   So if you have a positive charge
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.120]   to effectively work with the free negative charge,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.000]   then the system is stabilized
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.640]   or at least isn't pushed in the direction of inflammation.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.240]   Many people have heard of free radicals.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.080]   - Exactly.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:22:59.900]   - And that's what we're referring to.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.740]   - Exactly.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.520]   - You want to offset the free radicals.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.400]   - Correct.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.560]   - And to the biochemists out there and the biologists,
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.600]   I'm using the term offset loosely.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.460]   Okay, so melatonin in the context
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.460]   of how sunlight can activate melatonin within cells.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.600]   Maybe it's worth pointing out to people
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.320]   that when the pineal gland releases melatonin
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.680]   to make you sleepy,
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.840]   that's an endocrine or hormone type mechanism.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.520]   Hormones act on local tissues
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.240]   and more distant tissues in the body.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.080]   - Correct.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.120]   - Pheromones act between bodies.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.240]   - Right.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.460]   - In the context that you're describing,
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.560]   melatonin is acting within cell.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.400]   - Correct.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.220]   - Okay.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.540]   - So let's think of this dichotomy.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.560]   The mitochondria always needs to have antioxidants.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.840]   Otherwise it's going to become damaged.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.140]   Like if these free radicals are produced,
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.420]   the very next molecule that they bump into,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.560]   it's going to change it.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.000]   And if that's the mitochondria,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.980]   the mitochondria is going to be damaged.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.700]   So it needs a cooling system.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.720]   Just like your car has a cooling system for heat,
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.800]   the mitochondria needs a cooling system
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.420]   for oxidative stress.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.980]   What's the cooling system during the day?
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.220]   Sunlight comes in, activates these,
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.400]   it upregulates melatonin, which does that.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.300]   Well, when there is no sunlight,
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.360]   what is the cooling system then?
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.320]   It's the system that we've always known about.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.160]   And the reason why we've always known about it
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.900]   is because we can draw blood samples.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.560]   It's much easier to detect melatonin in the blood
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.240]   because we've developed techniques first
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.680]   to detect things in the blood.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.960]   But what we're talking about now
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   is how do we detect things not only intracellular,
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.480]   but intraorganelle.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.120]   That's a much more sophisticated.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.780]   Yet, now we do have the technology to show.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.540]   And the amount of melatonin we're talking about
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.300]   is 20 times higher than we're picking up in the blood.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.260]   So at night, the system is,
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.840]   melatonin is secreted from the pineal gland.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.500]   It goes into the blood, diffuses into the cell,
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.020]   diffuses into the mitochondria, and does the job.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.180]   Do you think that that role of melatonin
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.100]   from the pineal at night
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.580]   is part of the reason why sleep is so restorative?
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.420]   Absolutely.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.460]   It's probably no coincidence then
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.260]   that when we fall asleep,
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.220]   it's at least correlated with, and in many ways,
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.180]   caused by the reduction in core body temperature.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.660]   It's very unusual for melatonin levels to be high
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.940]   when body temperature is high.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.020]   These things normally are coordinated at night.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.600]   I'm not aware that it actually drops body temperature,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.440]   but it might.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.500]   I'm just not aware of the literature.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.100]   But what you're describing is amazing.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.740]   I mean, first of all,
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.780]   most people's minds, including mine,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.900]   are gonna be blown by the fact that
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.060]   long wavelength light can actually go through clothing
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.500]   and skin, and so you can imagine
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.180]   that if you have a minimum of clothing on,
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.220]   whatever's appropriate for that context,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.380]   and you get some sunlight on your skin,
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.060]   even on a cloudy day,
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.060]   some of this should be coming through.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:46.900]   We could talk about that.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.100]   It's more UV light, short wavelength light,
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.980]   that's gonna break through thick cloud cover.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.820]   Correct.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.880]   Cloud cover because it's water vapor,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.780]   and water vapor does absorb infrared.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.260]   It will be substantially less,
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.400]   but much more than being inside.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.200]   And on a clear day or partially cloudy day,
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.920]   we're getting a lot of red light,
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.040]   long wavelength light,
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.360]   and infrared and near-infrared light coming through.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.180]   Absolutely.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.020]   I think a lot of people don't realize that
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.760]   because in this age of red light devices
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.800]   and infrared light devices,
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   of which I own one and I love and I use,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.540]   but people forget that the primordial
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.280]   and arguably, I'll say,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.440]   the best source of red light
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.600]   and near-infrared light and infrared light
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.560]   of the sort that we're talking about right now
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.580]   is going to come from the sun, right?
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.000]   I mean, there's no device that can replace the sun.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.780]   100%, 100%, yeah.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.620]   Okay, great.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.620]   So how does this keep us safe from infection?
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.960]   As long as we're here,
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.600]   what else is it doing to offset the 70% reduction
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.720]   in mitochondrial function?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   'Cause what we're talking about now
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.360]   is the role of melatonin within cells
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.200]   to lower temperature
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   and reduce these reactive oxygen species.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.040]   Yes.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.600]   Does that somehow offset the reduction in mitochondria
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.880]   that normally occurs?
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.700]   It does.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:09.200]   So the increase in melatonin from infrared radiation
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.280]   going into the mitochondria is one aspect.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.220]   There's a whole host of other aspects that occur.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.240]   There is cytochrome 4 oxidase.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.280]   Again, one of those enzymes in the electron transport chain
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.780]   can absorb infrared light.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.560]   There's nitric oxide.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.000]   What the whole effect of this is,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.040]   and the bottom line is,
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.240]   is that when you have red light to near infrared light
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.160]   getting in that deep,
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   there is a increase in the efficiency of the mitochondria.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.280]   So this is the key point,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.920]   because if, in fact,
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.960]   with the theory of mitochondrial aging,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.160]   that we're having a decrease in the efficiency
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.960]   of the mitochondria as we get older,
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.040]   if there is something that we can do to reverse that
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.760]   or to at least prevent that from happening,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.980]   that can have a tremendous impact in our health overall.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.980]   So one point about infrared light and its characteristic,
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.460]   and then number two, let's actually get to some data,
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.360]   because we're saying a bunch of things,
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.360]   but what we really need is evidence-based stuff.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.920]   Okay, so the first thing,
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.500]   there's one other thing that I should mention
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.960]   about the effect of infrared light, especially in nature,
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.940]   and that is that not only can it penetrate through clothes.
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.460]   You may remember the Sony cam night vision thing
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.340]   back in the '90s,
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.080]   where Sony came up with a night vision camera
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.120]   that you could take pictures at night,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.000]   and some enterprising youth, probably a man,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.360]   figured out that you could use it during the day
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.760]   and you could see through clothes.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.880]   - And presumably, they took that off the market.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.360]   - They took it off the market pretty quick, yeah.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.240]   But there's one other thing
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.220]   that's really important to understand, too,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.040]   and that is that, believe it or not,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.760]   but the leaves on trees and grass,
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.460]   anything with chlorophyll,
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.320]   is highly reflective of infrared light.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.660]   What that means is that if you go outside on a sunny day,
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.900]   versus going outside on a sunny day
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.300]   surrounded by green, green spaces,
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.660]   you're gonna get probably two, three, four times
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.420]   more infrared light in that environment
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.780]   than you would without that environment.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.340]   If you, you could check this out.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.240]   You go to Google and just type in infrared photography
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.700]   and click images,
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.020]   and you will see any kind of infrared filtered light.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.540]   When it shows a tree or grass,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.060]   it looks like it's lit up, like it's got snow on it.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.660]   It's bright white.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.300]   It's very reflective.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.140]   On a hot summer day,
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.700]   if you go outside and touch some object that's in the sun,
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.180]   it's gonna be extremely hot.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.840]   Touch a leaf, it's not hot at all.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.500]   It's because it's reflecting that light.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.060]   In fact, the coolest place in a garden
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.300]   on a hot summer day is where?
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.820]   It's under a tree,
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.980]   because all of that infrared light is being reflected off.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.500]   And just to jump ahead here,
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.360]   but we know from years and decades of data
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.700]   that people who live in green spaces have reduced diabetes,
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.580]   reduced hypertension, reduced mortality,
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.300]   just living in green spaces.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.460]   - Is it possible to tease away the effect
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.900]   from the other things associated
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.000]   with living in green spaces? - Yes.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   - Because fortunately,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.100]   our audience is trained to think scientifically
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.660]   and they'll know, well, it's not necessarily causal, right?
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.620]   People who live in green spaces tend to walk more.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.940]   They tend to perhaps eat more fruits and vegetables
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.020]   and on and on.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.980]   - So getting onto that,
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.260]   there was a study that was just done in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.080]   Four square miles.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.480]   They measured everybody in that four square miles HSCRP.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.360]   What's HSCRP?
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.220]   It's basically it's a surrogate marker
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.320]   for inflammation in the body.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.400]   And then they did this.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.760]   They did something incredible.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   They brought in 8,000 plus trees, mature trees,
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.340]   and they planted those trees in that four square mile area.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.800]   Took them about a year.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   Two to three years later, they went out.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.000]   Nothing, the income of these people
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.200]   living in this four square mile area did not change.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.580]   Presumably, they did not do any exercise programs
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.420]   in this area.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.240]   Everything was the same.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.200]   The only thing they did was plant trees.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.560]   And they went out and they rechecked
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.960]   everybody's highly sensitive CRP levels.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.480]   They dropped by 13%.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.320]   - Wow.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.300]   - And that's about on the order,
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.340]   almost on the order of doing exercise three times a week.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.940]   - I should mention that CRPC reactive protein
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.840]   has been associated with a number of blinding eye diseases,
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.660]   associated with inflammation,
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.380]   and basically everything bad you can imagine
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.820]   in every organ of the body, heart attack, ischemia.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.060]   Yeah, this kind of thing.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.480]   Incredible.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.320]   - Yeah.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.940]   So let's actually look at some data.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.740]   So we've talked about, you know,
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.580]   any astute person listening to this is like,
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.340]   okay, so you talked about a lot of observational stuff.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.020]   Is there any interventional stuff?
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.720]   So I turned to Glenn Jeffrey,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.220]   who is, he's in the Department of Ophthalmology.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.380]   You know him well, actually, at University College London.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.980]   And he's done some really interesting experiments
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.500]   in the last two to three years looking at red light.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.420]   One of them was, the first one that he did
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:07.040]   was he took older subjects who had difficulty
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.000]   with color sensitivity in their vision.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.360]   And he exposed them to 670 nanometer, which is red,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.940]   it's visible light for just three minutes in the morning.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.420]   It only worked in the morning in this case,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.940]   which is interesting.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.620]   And he showed that there was a 17% increase
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.340]   in color sensitivity that lasted for days.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.420]   Now, why would that be?
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.580]   Again, you should know that the retina
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.460]   is the one tissue in the human body
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.700]   that has the highest concentration of mitochondria.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.980]   And if you understand what's going on in light,
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.340]   and I know you do, but our audience might not,
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.520]   is when you have visible light coming in to the retina,
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.900]   it is causing a photochemical reaction
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.500]   that requires a tremendous amount of energy.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.500]   Vesicles budding off, things diffusing,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.900]   electrical conductions being,
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.280]   and it has to happen very, very quickly.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.580]   Otherwise, what you see is gonna be there as a blur.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.860]   So this is constantly being updated.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.900]   So it's no surprise that mitochondria
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.660]   is so concentrated there.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.260]   So what's actually going on there?
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.500]   What we believe is going on is that this red light
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.500]   is actually stimulating these mitochondria
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.340]   to produce more ATP, and it's improving the sensitivity.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.420]   But the court de gras, or the piece de la resistance,
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.380]   was his next study, which he did,
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.820]   where he took 30 subjects,
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.540]   he gave them 75 grams of glucose,
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.020]   and in a blinded way,
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.460]   so they couldn't tell if the light was on or off,
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.460]   he exposed their backs to the same 670 nanometer light,
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.180]   and he monitored their glucose over time,
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.380]   over the next two hours, basically, multiple points.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.340]   And what did he find?
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.100]   He found that those that were exposed to red light
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.860]   and didn't know it had lower glucose concentrations.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.520]   So he surmised that the mitochondria
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.020]   were working more efficiently,
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.340]   they were using up more energy,
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.860]   and this is the reason why the glucose didn't peak as high.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.980]   But he couldn't be sure unless he also monitored
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.900]   for the output of metabolism.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.620]   So what happens when the mitochondria is working?
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.220]   It's making carbon dioxide.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.100]   So he also measured carbon dioxide.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.500]   And sure enough,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.900]   those subjects that had the intervention of the red light
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.940]   had statistically significantly higher
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.620]   carbon dioxide levels on exhalation.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.460]   - Awesome.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.420]   Too bad the guy's in England.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.820]   That's a joke for my British friends.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.460]   Yeah, it tends to be very overcast there,
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.460]   but the sun does come out in England as well.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.600]   - So here we have, basically,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.320]   this is a randomized controlled intervention trial,
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.940]   which showed that red light's doing this.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.060]   And there's a whole host of other trials
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:40.900]   that show the same thing.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.300]   So when I started to see this in my patients,
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.820]   and what caused me to even do this,
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.380]   you might ask what's a pulmonary critical care doc
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.080]   talking about mitochondria in the eye?
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.860]   What really spurred me on to look at this
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.380]   was when I was in the middle
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.620]   of something called the COVID pandemic,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.500]   and I was seeing patients in my ICU that were dying.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.140]   And what were they dying of?
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.400]   COVID, but what were they in there for?
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   They had things like diabetes, hypertension, dementia,
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.300]   all of these things which have at the root of them
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.500]   mitochondrial dysfunction.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.640]   So what we have is an epidemic, I believe,
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.420]   of mitochondrial dysfunction.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.880]   And how are we going to repair that?
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.500]   I think sunlight is one of the ways to do it.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.700]   So I started looking around at the evidence.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.160]   There was a study that was done,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.740]   Oxford and the University of Leiden in Netherlands,
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.480]   where they looked at about 10,000 subjects.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.980]   They just drew their blood, and they said,
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.140]   let's just check triglycerides and insulin sensitivity.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.500]   And then what they did was they looked
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.260]   over the previous 10 days at the weather report,
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.620]   and they were able to show that by the hour,
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.140]   the more sunlight that there was in the previous seven days,
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.700]   that actually predicted an improvement
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.500]   in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in triglycerides.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.660]   That fast, over a seven-day period of time.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.140]   There was another study that was done.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.020]   This was in Sweden.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.140]   So this was an epidemiological study,
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.620]   but maybe actually showed some causation.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.900]   They looked at Swedish women.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.460]   It was about 30,000 Swedish women
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.140]   living in Sweden at the time, of course.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.980]   And they divided them into three groups,
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.860]   those that avoided the sun,
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.820]   those that got moderate sun exposure,
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.380]   and those that got a lot of sun exposure.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.900]   And what they showed after following them for 20 years,
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.660]   so a long period of time,
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.660]   was that those women that were out in the sun
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.820]   not only had lower all-cause mortality,
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.220]   but they also had lower cardiovascular mortality.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.740]   And what's really interesting
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.780]   is they had lower cancer mortality,
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.820]   and it was in a dose-response curve,
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.740]   which suggests, Bradford Hill criteria,
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.780]   that there was maybe some causation here.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.740]   What was really interesting about that study
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.700]   is that they looked at smoking.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.980]   So what was the difference here?
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.860]   It wasn't a small difference.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.060]   It was actually such a large difference
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.260]   that the sunlight made that they were able to show
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.300]   that those women in Sweden who were in this study
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.860]   who went out into the sun avidly and smoked
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.140]   had the same mortality as those women
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.140]   who avoided the sun and didn't smoke.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.900]   The first thing that hit my mind was,
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.220]   is what do we do to people here in this country
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.060]   that want to smoke?
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.460]   We tell them to go outside.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.780]   I'm not encouraging people to smoke.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.740]   Clearly, the best outcomes are going to be
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.060]   from not smoking and from getting sunlight,
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.140]   but it is a remarkable study.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.860]   I mean, this is, certainly,
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.380]   smoking would be under the T for temperance.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.060]   That would be where I would put a new start.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.820]   We would not want to do that.
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.060]   But that same study was repeated basically again.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.460]   University of Edinburgh, they did a biobank study,
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.660]   10 times the amount of people, 400,000.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.180]   Repeated the study, showed exactly the same,
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.940]   both men and women.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.140]   Except this time, they actually measured UVA.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.500]   So they used ultraviolet A radiation
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.380]   as a surrogate for infrared and for sunlight in general.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.420]   They found exactly the same thing, reduction in mortality.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:24.220]   Such so is the evidence that even dermatologists
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.100]   are starting to rethink.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.660]   There was an article that was published
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.820]   in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.500]   by Richard Weller.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.060]   And the name of that article was published last year.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:38.100]   It was titled, "Sunlight, Time for a Rethink."
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.700]   And he said, look, there are societies that are seeing this,
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.420]   and they're already saying that there's a potential benefit
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.020]   for getting out into the sun.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:50.780]   Yeah, the dermatologist that I hosted on this podcast,
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:55.780]   Dr. Teo Soleimani, also happens to be a derma oncologist.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.760]   So his specialty is skin cancers.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.700]   And I was surprised to learn,
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:04.060]   but we've talked about several times now offline as well,
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.940]   Teo and I, I was surprised to learn
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.940]   that the sunlight-induced cancers of the skin,
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.140]   while they do exist, that's real, right?
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.340]   Get too much UV exposure,
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.100]   you're going to age your skin more rapidly.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.620]   You're going to increase the likelihood
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.820]   that you'll get a skin cancer.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.740]   However, this was really surprising to me.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.620]   According to him, there is no evidence
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.740]   that sunlight induces the deadly types
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.460]   of cancers like melanoma.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.140]   Those are more genetically determined.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.940]   - That's not to say that sunlight can't damage skin,
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.740]   but it is really interesting that more and more data
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.140]   and clinical trials included are pointing
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.300]   to exactly what you're saying,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:50.220]   which is that more sunlight exposure is beneficial.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.620]   And the risks of sunlight exposure can largely be offset
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.380]   by limiting your exposure to excessive UV.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.100]   And it's pretty easy nowadays with any app,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.580]   a lot of zero cost apps out there.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.360]   I can put links to one or two in the show note captions
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.860]   that I like that have no affiliation to whatsoever,
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.020]   by the way, will tell you when the UV index is highest.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.540]   It's in the middle of the day, typically.
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.300]   And so it's possible to get plenty of sunlight
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.660]   on your skin without exposing yourself to excessive UV.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.180]   - Yeah, and I'd even take it a step further
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.940]   because we know that a single layer of clothing
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.660]   can actually, is pretty good
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.980]   at blocking ultraviolet lights, right?
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.100]   But remember what we talked about infrared.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.500]   Infrared can penetrate through.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.620]   So if someone is fair skin
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.500]   and they're concerned about getting skin damage,
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.300]   wear a broad rimmed hat, put a long sleeve shirt on,
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.140]   but get outside because that's where the infrared,
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.180]   especially if you're around, you know,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:48.420]   green shrubs and leaves and things,
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.260]   'cause there's a lot of infrared light.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.780]   We know that green spaces are beneficial in terms of that.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.300]   And we've talked about, you know, Louisville, Kentucky,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.860]   that there's a benefit there just by putting the tree there.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.620]   - I love those data.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.140]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, AG1.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.500]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.920]   with adaptogens.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.820]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.300]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.020]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.740]   and the reason I still take AG1
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.240]   is because it is the highest quality
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.140]   and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.140]   What that means is that AG1 ensures
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.380]   that you're getting all the necessary vitamins,
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.240]   minerals, and other micronutrients
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.940]   to form a strong foundation for your daily health.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.580]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.500]   that support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.540]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.240]   that align your digestive tract
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.740]   and impact things such as your immune system status,
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.720]   your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily,
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.940]   my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust,
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.540]   and my mood and mental focus are at their best.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.740]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement,
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.940]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.340]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.580]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.620]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.140]   that has everything you need, but nothing you don't.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.340]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.020]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.460]   all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.780]   Proper hydration is critical
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.900]   for optimal brain and body function.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.540]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.200]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.460]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.180]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.260]   are vital for the functioning
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.700]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.940]   especially your neurons or your nerve cells.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.340]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.820]   makes it extremely easy to ensure
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.660]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.260]   and adequate electrolytes.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.860]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.540]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.020]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.060]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.060]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.580]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.300]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.020]   during any kind of physical exercise
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.960]   that I'm doing, especially on hot days
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.040]   when I'm sweating a lot,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.920]   and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.760]   They have a bunch of different
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.600]   great-tasting flavors of Element.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.680]   They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.000]   Frankly, I love them all.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.340]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.440]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.080]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.300]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.400]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.700]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.380]   In terms of your original question,
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:38.400]   which is getting back to influenza or flus or things,
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.160]   so there's a great study
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.820]   that I always love to talk about in terms of this,
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.520]   and it was actually done by Harvard.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.580]   It was a Harvard-Kennedy School,
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.080]   which is not the medical school.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.200]   This is the public policy/politics school,
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.720]   and what they did was they looked
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.880]   at this very question of influenza
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.520]   and why do we always get it in the wintertime
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.480]   and what's potentially beneficial for it,
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.840]   and the problem is is that
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.460]   we always have this influenza season,
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.660]   which is in the wintertime.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.060]   We can talk about why that might be.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.660]   I would suggest to you that it's because
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.340]   that's when we have the shortest day of the year,
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.580]   but we also have other things that happen at that time.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.420]   What else is happening?
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.860]   We're having parties at that time.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:17.900]   There's Thanksgiving.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.740]   There's New Year's.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.340]   It's cold.
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.220]   Does the temperature have anything to do with it?
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.460]   We're also inside because it's cold.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.020]   So what is it that's actually doing it?
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.820]   Well, 2009 was a banner year
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   because 2009 was the year that we had the H1N1 pandemic,
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.880]   and that was a boon for us.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.560]   The reason is is because,
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.940]   not because of the deaths that we had,
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.000]   but from a scientific standpoint,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.020]   this epidemic actually peaked in the summertime,
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:49.280]   and it was in areas where the humidity was sometimes high
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.560]   and sometimes it was low,
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.920]   and sometimes the temperature was high.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.000]   Sometimes the temperature was low.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.400]   Sometimes the sun was out.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.640]   Sometimes it was cloudy.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:00.660]   In other words, we uncoupled the influenza virus in 2009
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.300]   from it being in the wintertime
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.660]   and all of those things that were associated.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.100]   So now we have all of these data points,
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.980]   and so Harvard went to work
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.020]   at looking at all these data points.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:16.340]   They looked at solar radiation data at that time,
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.780]   and they were actually able to look specifically
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.700]   where that person came from
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.220]   and what was the solar radiation in that particular area,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.600]   and what they came up with was, absolutely.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.100]   They said, quote, "Sunlight strongly protects
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.580]   "against getting influenza."
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.300]   It was an amazing study.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.040]   I'm reminded of a study that was published in COVID.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.120]   This was published in 2021,
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.680]   and it was looking at this very question.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.820]   Is it temperature?
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.040]   Is it humidity?
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.000]   Or is it sunlight?
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.600]   So what they did was they looked at the autumn surge
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.200]   of COVID in the wintertime in Europe, in autumn, actually,
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.160]   and they asked this question.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.840]   When there was the surge date in this country,
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.160]   whatever country it was in Europe, when did it happen,
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.200]   and what were the things that caused it to happen?
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.220]   So they put all the data out there for temperature,
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.400]   and it was a flat line.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.040]   Temperature did not predict which country,
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.480]   how the country got COVID-19
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.600]   when the surge started to happen.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.880]   They did the same thing for humidity, flat line.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.760]   When they got to latitude, it was a perfect correlation.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.340]   In other words, as the sun in the wintertime
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.120]   started to peel back off of the northern hemisphere,
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.280]   it started to sink below the equator,
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.160]   and when there was a critical period of time
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.280]   that the day shortened to the point
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.600]   where at first Finland got the shortest day,
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.160]   or short enough day, and then Germany, and then further on,
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.320]   what it showed was latitude actually perfectly predicted
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.680]   when the surge dates would happen,
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.080]   starting off with Finland
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.520]   and ending up with Greece at the bottom.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.360]   - Wow.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.480]   Do you see influenza at the equator?
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.880]   - You do see, certainly, influenza at the equator,
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.160]   but what's really interesting about that
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.840]   is that if you look at, for instance,
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.080]   the influenza mortality in the United States,
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.800]   obviously in the northern hemisphere,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.440]   what you will see is you will see it peak
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.400]   generally one to three weeks
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.560]   after the shortest day of the year,
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.600]   which is around now, in December and January.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.320]   Now, if you look at Australia,
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.960]   what do you think you'd see?
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.000]   - The inverse.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.120]   - Exactly.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.280]   It's actually, in Australia,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.640]   the influenza season peaks late June, early July.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.600]   So if you now go look at something like Singapore,
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.360]   Singapore is, I think, within 100 miles of the equator,
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.920]   you will see that in Singapore,
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.120]   there is influenza peaks and troughs,
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.840]   but it's not seasonal.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.520]   It's just almost random.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.760]   - Is it not the case that in hospitals
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   and other recovery wards, as it were,
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.520]   that there used to be, classically,
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.480]   there was a habit of putting people out into the sun,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.200]   like sun decks on the roof of hospitals
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.160]   and things of that sort?
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.960]   - I'm smiling because you're absolutely correct.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   You're absolutely correct.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.440]   And as I started to go through this and look at this,
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.280]   I started saying to myself,
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.440]   "We need to get people out in the sun."
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.080]   And then I realized,
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.760]   not only am I not the only one saying this,
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.360]   but certainly this was being done 100 years ago,
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.920]   150 years ago.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.360]   - Just as a speculation,
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.000]   why do you think we've migrated away
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.680]   from this, frankly, basic biochemical, cellular understanding
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.640]   of how the sun can benefit us?
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.960]   I mean, I feel like so much attention has been paid
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.640]   to how the sun can damage our skin
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.000]   and "give us skin cancer"
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.440]   that perhaps we overshot the mark.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.880]   - I think it has to do with scientific reductionism.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.920]   And what I mean to say by that is we've had a lot of data
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.040]   that shows that ultraviolet light can cause cancer.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.240]   And so we've assumed that anything
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.760]   that has ultraviolet light can cause cancer.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.840]   There's this complete dismissal of the fact
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.480]   that this ultraviolet light is packaged
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.560]   for the entire existence of human nature
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.800]   along with infrared light.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.120]   And it's a beautiful thing when you start to look at this,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.800]   because you start to realize that the infrared,
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.640]   we never get blue light or ultraviolet light ever
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.920]   without the presence of infrared light.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.640]   - Unless it comes from an artificial source.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.080]   - Exactly.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.320]   So this is really the first time in human history
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.880]   that we've had this preponderance of short wavelength,
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.920]   aka blue and green light in the absence of red light.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   In fact, maybe we should just spend a couple of moments
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.720]   talking about what kind of sunlight exposures
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.360]   you recommend for people, depending on time of year.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.000]   And then after that, I'd like to talk to you briefly
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.240]   about this shift away from incandescent bulbs
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.280]   to indoor lighting with LEDs.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.160]   But just to make sure that I don't move us along
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.960]   before providing some of the key takeaways.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.880]   - Yes.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.360]   - How much sunlight should we get each day
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.680]   in the shorter days of winter and in the fall?
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.280]   And when should this be done?
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.160]   In the Jeffrey study,
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.160]   it was clear that there was circadian regulation,
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.920]   as you mentioned, getting that sunlight,
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.120]   excuse me, getting that red light,
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.080]   infrared light into one's eyes early in the day
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.320]   was important.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:36.000]   If I'm living a standard life of work and job
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.480]   and people are managing kids and all sorts of things,
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.200]   sometimes it's hard to get into the sunlight
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.120]   because you're just following a schedule.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.560]   How much time each day do you recommend
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.360]   independent of anything related to getting sunlight
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.160]   in one's eyes for circadian rhythm setting?
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.000]   - Right.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.760]   - So how much time, what time of day
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.960]   and what frequency across the week?
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.000]   - Excellent question.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.940]   And you've hit on exactly the issue.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:01.720]   Based on Glenn Jeffrey's studies,
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.160]   based on another study that was actually done in Brazil,
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.040]   it was actually an interventional study in COVID
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   that showed that just 15 minutes a day for seven days
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.760]   was enough to actually get people with COVID
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.000]   out of the hospital faster.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.640]   This was a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded,
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.560]   amazing study, 940 nanometers.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.120]   So when I talked to Glenn Jeffrey about this,
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.520]   he says he sees it in humans, he sees it in bees,
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.480]   he sees it in insects, it's all the same.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.400]   The mitochondria behave exactly the same.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   - When you say 940 nanometers,
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.440]   you're talking about long wavelength,
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.920]   like coming from an artificial source?
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.760]   - Correct.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.580]   - Okay.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.420]   - Yeah, that was 940.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.240]   And it was actually very low.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.960]   It was about 2.9 milliwatts per square centimeter.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.000]   - So lower energy.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Most people are not going to own a far-red
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.660]   or an infrared light.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.680]   So I just want to emphasize again for people,
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.400]   you can get that wavelength
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.640]   and all the other relevant wavelengths from the sun.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.480]   - Exactly.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.880]   - That's your red light therapy, folks.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.720]   - Exactly.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.560]   And this is what I'm trying to say.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.560]   This is not like some powerful laser that they were using.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.360]   This is 2.9 milliwatts.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.640]   I mean, sunlight,
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.640]   all sunlight is about 100 milliwatts per centimeter squared.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.360]   - By time it reaches?
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.200]   - Through the atmosphere.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.020]   - Through the atmosphere.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.120]   - Yeah, so 130 when it hits the atmosphere.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.160]   By the time it hits you, it's about 100.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.180]   If you're looking at just infrared light,
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.920]   we're talking about 20 milliwatts per square centimeter.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.180]   And so this was 2.9 at a very specific wavelength.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.360]   So something that's completely doable, okay?
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.200]   And so what they did,
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.960]   it was 15 minutes a day for seven days.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.760]   And what Glenn Jeffrey was telling me is that,
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:48.200]   he says, "Roger, it doesn't matter if it's in insects,
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.160]   "if it's in bees, if it's in humans.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.020]   "Once you hit a certain point, 15, 20 minutes,
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.520]   "diminishing marginal utility.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.960]   "The improvement after that point is so minimal
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.440]   "that you only need about 15 to 20 minutes."
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.920]   That's why he was able to do his experiment in the eye.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.040]   About three minutes was all that was necessary.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.560]   - So is this 15 minutes outside
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:13.440]   in the first three hours of your conventional day,
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.260]   as I call it?
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:15.100]   'Cause people will say,
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.680]   "Well, the sun comes up later this hour."
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.920]   Conventional day, meaning after the sun
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.720]   has crossed the horizon, it has risen.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.880]   - I don't think it matters.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.080]   I don't really think it matters.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.000]   I think what would matter
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.400]   is if there's a lot of ultraviolet light,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.880]   which would be when the sun is high.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.560]   And for people who are skin sensitive,
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.400]   that could be an issue.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.320]   But if you're covering up, it doesn't matter.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.640]   And here's the issue.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.480]   The issue is that when you need it the most
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.980]   in the wintertime is when it's the hardest to get.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.580]   So you really have to make a concerted effort.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.680]   And for a lot of people,
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.400]   and this is what happens probably right after November,
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.320]   and probably going through to mid-January,
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.480]   is this is what happens.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.240]   People get up in the morning, they go to their car,
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.120]   they get into their car, they drive to work,
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.680]   the sun's not up yet.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.480]   They get to their work, the sun comes up,
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.800]   but they're inside.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.560]   Then what happens is they get done with work,
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.800]   the sun is already down, they come home from work.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:09.640]   And so there literally is weeks on end that occur
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.440]   where they're not even getting 15 minutes of sunlight.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.960]   And I think this is the reason why
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.120]   we have the influenza surge at this time.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.300]   If you look to see, the EPA did a study,
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.520]   and they looked at Americans.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.100]   93% of our time is spent inside.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:29.120]   86% inside a building, 6% to 7% inside of a vehicle.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.000]   - And this is a relatively new thing.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.560]   - I mean, certainly when I was growing up,
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.760]   if I came home and had a snack after school,
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.520]   I was getting kicked out of the house to go outside.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.980]   It was routine for parents to tell kids
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.700]   they had to go outside.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:49.160]   And I think there's also, it's also the case,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.240]   as you mentioned, that we're working later,
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.360]   or at least on devices later into the evening,
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.320]   which means there's more exposure to short wavelength light
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.080]   from devices and artificial sources.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.640]   So my recommendation,
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.520]   which is what the original question was,
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.960]   is take your lunch break outside.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.360]   It's something as simple as getting outside,
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.600]   even if it's at lunchtime.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.780]   Yes, the ultraviolet is probably the highest at that point,
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.160]   but if that's the only time
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.440]   that you're gonna get sunlight, take it.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.080]   Now for some, you know, we can say this,
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.880]   I can say this, I live in Southern California.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:26.100]   I'm blessed by 300 and some odd days of sunlight every year.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.440]   What do you do when you're in Boston?
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.720]   What do you do if you're in New York?
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.520]   What do you do if you're in England and Sweden
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.560]   and these places where there isn't a lot of light?
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.640]   Well, there's a study that was done
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.160]   looking at infrared lamps, right?
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.720]   So you've gotta be careful there
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.720]   because if the infrared lamps are too high in amplitude,
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.680]   this result from infrared light in the body
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.000]   is something known as a biphasic response.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.120]   And that's really important to understand.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.440]   Don't come into this
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.960]   if you're gonna get a red light therapy
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   and think that more is better
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.060]   because more may not be better.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:01.800]   You actually could do detriment
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.760]   if you have the red light at too high of a level.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.880]   So I would match it to what we're getting from the sun.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.960]   As you said, the sunlight is your best infrared or red lamp.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.080]   So there was a study that was done looking at wellbeing
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:20.920]   and they did a red lamp, red light lamp, infrared light.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.300]   So it was coupled with 850, I think was the nanometer.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.000]   So that is definitely in the infrared spectrum.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.040]   - Yeah, you can't see that.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:27.880]   - You cannot see it.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.320]   And they had it set up at a desk
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.640]   that some guy was sitting in front of
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.200]   for four hours a day for eight weeks.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.520]   And they did the study and they did it in the summertime
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.840]   and they did it in the wintertime.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.560]   And this is really telling.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.960]   There was no effect on the subjects
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.780]   when they looked at those that had it in the summertime.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.620]   I would say probably
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:50.320]   because they were getting plenty of infrared light elsewhere.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.880]   They only showed a statistically significant effect
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.320]   in the wintertime.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:58.920]   And so if you look at influenza,
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.400]   I would even go beyond that.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.160]   Look at a chart of the United States
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.200]   throughout the entire year
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.880]   and look at all of the natural causes of death,
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.480]   not just influenza and pneumonia.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.840]   Look at cardiac disease.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.200]   Look at kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.960]   All of those deaths go up all at the same time
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.640]   and they all go up about one to three weeks
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.000]   after the shortest day of the year.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.080]   And they all come down and they all are at the nadir
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.340]   about one to three weeks after the longest day of the year.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.440]   When you see that,
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.600]   and you just start to just digest what you're seeing there,
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.200]   and then you start to understand
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.720]   that infrared light from the sun,
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.920]   which we have filtered out with LEDs and all this,
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.360]   we can get to that.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.200]   All of that's gone,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.220]   that we're spending 93% of our time indoors.
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.240]   Put that all together
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.560]   and the fact that infrared light helps the mitochondria
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.880]   and the fact that the mitochondria
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.600]   is at the sort of the core of all of these chronic diseases
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   that we're battling,
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.400]   it really wakes you up.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.240]   And you start to realize that maybe the lowest hanging fruit
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.900]   that we can do right now today for literally no money
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.820]   is simply to just work on getting more sun exposure
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.720]   in the wintertime.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.880]   - Two questions.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.960]   One, it's hard to attach a single number to this,
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   but what fraction of the obesity epidemic
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.280]   that we observe in the United States
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   do you think is caused by altered interactions
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.720]   with sunlight or artificial light and its consequences,
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.640]   or put differently?
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.940]   Let me phrase the question differently.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.000]   If we were designing an experiment
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.500]   and I wanted to wager the hypothesis
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:46.360]   that exposure to 15 minutes a day of sunlight
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:51.360]   could help reduce adipose tissue, et cetera,
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.560]   independent of caloric intake,
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.560]   I know this is kind of a heretical idea,
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.960]   independent of additional exercise and all that,
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.520]   and I designed the experiment with you
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.200]   and we said, okay, people are gonna go outside
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.400]   for 15 minutes a day,
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.900]   they're gonna wear short sleeves if they can,
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.700]   or just a simple long sleeve clothing,
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.840]   they're gonna get this long wavelength light from the sun
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.600]   15 minutes a day.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.840]   Based on what you told us about the light shown on the back
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.760]   and the lower glucose response,
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.440]   independent of all other variables,
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:25.440]   what percentage improvement in sort of the overall metrics
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.400]   of obesity and metabolic disease do you think you would
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.920]   predict if we were just gonna,
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.520]   we'd bet a sushi dinner, for instance.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.200]   I guess another way of asking the question is,
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.600]   at what level would I be really surprised?
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.480]   If it was 50%, I would be surprised.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.320]   - Same.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.240]   - Yeah, if it was 20 to 30%,
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.880]   I think that would probably be where it is,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.360]   but that's significant.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.400]   - That's still significant.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.420]   Okay, so that's very helpful.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:53.120]   I think a lot of people hearing about the role of sunlight
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.120]   and long wavelength light in particular,
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.840]   its potential influence on improving
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.880]   overall immune system function, metabolic health, et cetera,
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.640]   might think that this sounds a little bit kind of biohacky
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.800]   because the moment we get into red lights,
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.640]   that's sort of like cold plunges,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.440]   it's kind of immediately associated
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.600]   with kind of biohacking.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.040]   People say it's bro science, this kind of thing.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.280]   I just wanted to remind people that in the early 1900s,
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.760]   a Nobel prize was given for the use of phototherapy,
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.000]   which is what we're describing for the treatment of lupus.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.240]   So the idea that specific wavelengths of light
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.520]   can be used in order to treat cellular health
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.320]   or offset cellular disease is not a new idea at all.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.240]   And you mentioned this earlier,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.880]   but I just wanted to underscore that for people.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.220]   The other way of looking at all this
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.820]   is that it's primitive.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.360]   So some people will say, oh, this is biohacking, right?
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.880]   Other people will say, well, this is just primitive,
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.440]   like get sunlight, of course.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   But you made a very key point,
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.880]   which is that the way we interact with light
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.080]   and particularly with sunlight nowadays
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.120]   is so disrupted compared to how it was just 10, 15,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.160]   especially 20 years ago.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.240]   I would just encourage people to pay attention for one week
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.340]   to how much time you're actually getting outside.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.120]   Now, a few people will already be getting
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.880]   a lot of time outside, but just pay attention.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.220]   How much time each day do you actually get outside
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:20.220]   without sunglasses on and just measure your total exposure
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.980]   to outdoor time, let alone sunlight?
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.660]   I think that's just an important experiment
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.500]   for people to do.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.420]   And because when one does that, you start to realize,
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.540]   my goodness, I'm hardly getting outside at all.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.760]   - Yeah, there was a study that was done
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.940]   looking at just this, except they actually used watches
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.780]   that was able to detect how much light.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.060]   And it wasn't infrared light, but just total light.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.100]   And the name of the study was basically
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.580]   dark days and bright nights.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.980]   And that is associated with higher mortality.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.860]   We know, of course, about bright nights not being good.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.160]   So not having a dark room to sleep in.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.080]   These are things that can impair melatonin.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.940]   That's associated with all sorts of bad things.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.860]   But the dark days was something
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:02.520]   that we really had not seen.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.520]   And it was very interesting.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.020]   They actually could show by the hour
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.640]   that if you were having light coming in,
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.860]   exactly what that did to your mortality.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.340]   And mortality went up dramatically
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.460]   as you were still in daylight about midnight,
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.300]   but right around seven o'clock in the morning,
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.580]   eight o'clock in the morning,
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.420]   if you were out there and you're getting light now,
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.340]   instead of light being a liability,
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.620]   it was now a benefit and it dropped dramatically.
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:32.540]   - I also wanna point out that when it's raining out
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.860]   or when it's very cold out,
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.780]   even when it's dark and cloudy, quote unquote dark and cloudy
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.360]   there's far more photons coming through the cloud cover
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.580]   during the day than at night.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.600]   People, I can't tell you if I had a dollar
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.760]   for every time somebody said to me online and in-person,
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.240]   there's no sunlight where I live.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.880]   Listen, go outside on the shortest day of the year.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.720]   Go outside folks and look at how bright it is
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.240]   at 10 a.m. or even 2 p.m.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.920]   Compare that to the middle of the night.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.040]   There is sunlight.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.880]   Unless you live in a cave, there's sunlight all year round.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.160]   It's just striking.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.400]   So this morning, for Southern California,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.000]   it's pretty overcast today.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.400]   It's a misty rain, a little bit more.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.980]   And I didn't wanna go outside
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.400]   and get my sunlight this morning,
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.600]   but I know I was gonna be in the studio all day.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.160]   And so I went downstairs and I put on a beanie cap
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.480]   and a hoodie and I just got outside with no sunglasses
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.400]   and got some sunlight in my eyes.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.440]   It's really bright outside even when it's raining.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.120]   It's really bright outside even when it's storming.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.240]   And I think people somehow,
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.440]   they think that if it's not a clear sunny day,
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.840]   there's no sunlight to be had.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.680]   - Correct.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.040]   - And there are many gems that you're providing us today,
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.860]   but one key takeaway is I want people to understand
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.760]   there is sunlight all year round.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:54.040]   Yes, unless you live truly a subterranean life,
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.960]   that you are underground,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.200]   there is sunlight during the daytime.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.840]   - Yeah, and if there is, we have to work on that.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.060]   To your point about it being primitive,
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.780]   I was looking at the history of this
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.360]   and it was actually very interesting to me.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.560]   We used to have tuberculosis sanitariums
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.400]   at very high altitude and part of that treatment
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.320]   was getting out into the sun.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.220]   At very high altitude, you have less atmosphere,
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.700]   more ultraviolet light coming in,
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.680]   more light in general coming in.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.880]   And when I started to look at this,
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.600]   I found it was very interesting what people started to say
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.760]   and what these people were actually saying
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.280]   at the time about sunlight.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.600]   In terms of these people, these physicians
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.080]   and these healthcare providers back in the 1800s,
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.320]   they didn't have all of the scientific accoutrements
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.420]   that we have today.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.280]   They didn't have X-rays and things of that nature.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.600]   But one thing that they were very, very good at,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.840]   probably better than we are good at,
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.960]   is their power of observation.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.400]   They were able to get a stethoscope, put it on the chest,
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.120]   listen to the space between the second heart sound
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.280]   and the opening snap and be able to say,
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.920]   this person's got severe mitral stenosis,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.640]   this is the one you need to operate on.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.480]   And they would do that.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.560]   And sure enough, when they opened it up, sure enough,
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.120]   this is the one that had...
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.400]   So the power of observation was probably better
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.320]   back in the 1800s.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.160]   So what do you have?
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.360]   You have people like Florence Nightingale,
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.400]   who is the founder of modern nursing.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:19.320]   And she was there during the Crimean War,
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.920]   taking care of British soldiers.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.160]   And she wrote down,
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.880]   I'm paraphrasing basically what she said.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.600]   She said, look, when it comes to treating the whole patient,
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.840]   the one thing that more than anything else
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.280]   is beneficial for these soldiers to recover is fresh air.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   But she said, a very close second is direct sunlight,
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.000]   getting them out into sunshine,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.280]   getting them out into direct sunlight.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.680]   When I was looking at the Smithsonian Institute
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.040]   a couple of years ago, a few years ago,
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.680]   they put out their top 100 most influential Americans
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.600]   of all time.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.680]   Well, one of them was this lady.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.480]   She's the most translated female author in the world.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.080]   Her name is Ellen G. White.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.520]   And she had a third grade education,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:09.280]   but she was also very interested in health, health reform.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.880]   And she wrote at that time in the 1800s
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.680]   that we ought to be getting out into the sunlight,
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.320]   that that makes a big difference.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.120]   Interestingly, something else that she said
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.360]   that I found really amazing,
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.560]   and this is, they're writing this before we understand
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.920]   circadian rhythm, before we understand melatonin.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.080]   She wrote down, she's like, hey,
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.480]   this idea of keeping the lights on after nine o'clock,
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.560]   it's a wretched health-destroying habit.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560]   Every light should be extinguished,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.840]   she said, after nine o'clock.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.680]   So I know about her sayings a little bit
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.440]   because she was the founder of Loma Linda University,
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.680]   which is where I went to school.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.160]   So, but just, we had this knowledge.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.560]   As you said, we had hospitals that were designed
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.520]   specifically to get people out of the hospital
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.480]   and into the sunlight.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.480]   You could see the architecture was designed for this.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.080]   Why don't we do this today?
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.800]   I think we ought to, but I kind of have a sense.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.680]   You asked the question, why don't we do this today?
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.120]   I have patients that I take care of,
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.800]   now that I understand this.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.040]   I have patients that I have in the intensive care unit
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.720]   that I wanna get outside in the sunlight,
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.400]   actually try to get them out.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.800]   It's difficult to do.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.300]   These people are critical.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.560]   The people that we admit to the hospitals today
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.120]   are far sicker than the people that we admitted
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.440]   to sanitariums and hospitals in the 1800s.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.440]   You have to make sure that they don't desaturate.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.860]   You gotta take the oxygen tank out there with them.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.040]   You've got to make sure that they don't have a code.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.200]   I mean, you're outside, right?
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.820]   So you're outside of the bowels of the hospital
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.040]   where your support system is.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.600]   It's a little bit of a risk
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.720]   to get those patients out there.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.660]   Nevertheless, I've convinced some of my hospital staff
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.440]   to do that, and I've had a number of success stories
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.480]   where we've had patients that were ready to be intubated,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.640]   and we got them outside in the sunlight,
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.600]   and they steadily improved dramatically
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.960]   after days of getting worse, and they got better.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.320]   There was a lady that actually contacted me.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.200]   Her name is Amy Hahnmeier, H-O-N-M-Y-H-R,
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.040]   if you wanna look her up.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:06.860]   She's on social media.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.860]   Her son, this is a really amazing story.
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:14.960]   Her son basically at the age of 15 got leukemia,
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.620]   got put on chemotherapy, and this was in Minnesota.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.420]   Fortunately, it was in the summertime,
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.900]   and he got admitted to the hospital
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:23.700]   with what they call neutropenic fever,
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.780]   very high fevers, very low white counts
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.580]   as a result of the chemotherapy,
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.680]   and his immune system was completely shot,
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.260]   and unfortunately, he developed a very severe
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.780]   fungal infection in his lung called mucor,
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.520]   and it just basically eats up the lung,
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.780]   goes right to the blood vessels.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:44.500]   He got so bad that there was only one solution
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.340]   that they had at the time,
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.140]   and that was to take out the left lung,
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.180]   so they took out the left lung,
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.420]   and he continued to get worse.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.300]   The right lung became infected.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.720]   He started to get worse, had higher fevers.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.820]   They had a meeting with the family.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.980]   15 years old, completely with it,
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.140]   realizing that he's dying,
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.140]   and they have to tell him that he's dying,
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.020]   so they made him what they call no-code, or DNR,
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.980]   and the staff came to him, and you can imagine,
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.220]   and I've been in this position before
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.180]   where you're trying to do everything you possibly can,
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:16.020]   and you just, you can't do anything else,
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.420]   so they came to him, the 15-year-old,
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.180]   and they said, "You know, this is it.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.860]   "Do you have any basically last wishes?"
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.320]   And, you know, Amy, his mom told me
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.100]   that he'd like to play outside,
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.380]   so he told them, you know, without any knowledge
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.700]   about what we'd just been talking about,
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.960]   he just, this is his dying wish, "Take me outside.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.100]   "I just wanna go outside,"
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:41.100]   and you know that nursing staff will move heaven and earth
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.060]   to do something that the patient requests to do,
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.500]   even though it's not gonna, you know, benefit them.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.020]   They still want, this is dying wish, they're gonna do it,
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.500]   so they hooked up oxygen tanks.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:56.500]   They got this 15-year-old boy in a hospital bed
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:02.480]   outside on BiPAP with oxygen tanks for five hours a day.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.420]   His mom was telling me they were also using
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.060]   something called a Firefly device,
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.300]   where they were just basically shining a light onto him
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.460]   to see if it would work.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:15.540]   You know how this story ends.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.820]   He did not die in two days like they told him.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.860]   He got better.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:20.220]   His fever went away.
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.380]   His oxygen requirements came down,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.640]   and I'm not telling you this as a proof
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.560]   that this is what happens,
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.300]   but you have to realize that he was in the hospital
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:33.300]   for six weeks underneath, you know, LED lighting,
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:37.900]   and as soon as he got outside, fever went away,
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.060]   and make a long story short, after five days,
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:40.940]   he came back inside.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.980]   They repeated the CT scan, and she sent me the CT scans.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.820]   I've seen 'em.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.460]   We actually did a little thing on our MedCram channel on it,
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:52.260]   and the disease was almost gone.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.140]   There's no explanation.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.660]   To this day, they don't have an explanation.
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.220]   - He's still alive today. - He's still alive.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.300]   He's getting chemotherapy.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.940]   He went from basically, of course, he's missing a lung,
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.260]   but he still has that lung.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.940]   He's on, he's getting the antifungal medication.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.740]   There's no sign of the fungus anywhere,
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.180]   so this is an anecdotal story.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:14.660]   It doesn't prove anything, and I don't present it as proof.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.780]   The things that I present as proof
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.180]   is randomized control trials, epidemiological trials
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.220]   with dose-response curves.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.420]   These are things that we can actually show the science with.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.980]   The reason why I bring it up is because
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.340]   it shows what is it that we would need to do
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.620]   to get this type of treatment.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:32.060]   It's not easy to do, but if there is a will,
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.220]   there's a way to do it.
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.460]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.260]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Function.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.860]   Last year, I became a Function member
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:42.140]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.620]   to lab testing.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.580]   Function provides over 100 advanced lab tests
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:50.020]   that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily health.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.660]   This snapshot offers you with insights
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.460]   on your heart health, hormone health,
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.660]   immune functioning, nutrient levels, and much more.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.740]   They've also recently added tests for toxins,
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:01.340]   such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics,
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.300]   and tests for PFASs, or forever chemicals.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.180]   Function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.100]   key to your physical and mental health,
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.980]   but it also analyzes these results
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.140]   and provides insights from top doctors
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.220]   who are expert in the relevant areas.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.880]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.020]   I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:22.980]   Function not only helped me detect that,
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.460]   but offered insights into how best
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.000]   to reduce my mercury levels,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.380]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.780]   I'd been eating a lot of tuna,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.000]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.360]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.400]   both of which can support glutathione production
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.860]   and detoxification.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.380]   And I should say, by taking a second Function test,
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.380]   that approach worked.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.860]   Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.740]   There's so many things related to your mental
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.900]   and physical health
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.400]   that can only be detected in a blood test.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.820]   The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:52.820]   and complicated.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.580]   In contrast, I've been super impressed
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.820]   by Function's simplicity and at the level of cost.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.100]   It is very affordable.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:12:59.940]   As a consequence,
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.260]   I decided to join their scientific advisory board,
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.900]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.260]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:09.220]   you can go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.340]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.460]   but they're offering early access
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.140]   to Huberman podcast listeners.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.380]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:22.040]   to get early access to Function.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:26.320]   - It's a spectacular story by any account.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.420]   I wanted to just touch on the fact
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.160]   that there's no replacement for sunlight.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.460]   Getting patients outside is hard.
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.960]   And at the same time,
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.660]   most people listening to this aren't,
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.340]   fortunately, are not patients.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:44.180]   Thank goodness.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.820]   Many people, however, have relatives
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.760]   or themselves are elderly.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.080]   As people get older,
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.000]   they tend to slow down, get outside less.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.520]   There are many fortunate exceptions to this,
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.040]   but one of the setups that I created for myself
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.240]   that I think is certainly feasible for a lot of people
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.440]   is the following.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.320]   Well, first of all,
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.840]   I always make it a point to get outside
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.280]   and get sunlight in my eyes,
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.460]   rain or shine.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.720]   And regardless of where I'm traveling and et cetera,
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.200]   I do that every single day.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.020]   If I miss a day,
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.920]   it's only because of something like a flight
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.040]   where I happen to be on a plane
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.520]   at the time of sunrise or something like that,
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.880]   in any case.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.280]   But I have a setup that I constructed for myself
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.320]   that is basically a 10,000 lux light.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.220]   These are available.
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.320]   I don't have any relationship to 10,000 lux light sources.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.560]   Those 10,000 lux light sources
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.600]   tend to be short wavelength shifted.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.960]   They tend to be very blue.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.820]   They're white light,
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.120]   but I don't think they have power
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.280]   across the visible spectrum.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.240]   I think they're very a red light and infrared diminished.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.480]   They tend to be very blue and green light enriched
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.840]   and it shows up as very bright white light.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.200]   So that's what I put in front of me when I first wake up
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.280]   if the sun isn't out yet.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.240]   But now I've started putting a red light
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.080]   near infrared light next to it.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.800]   And I'll spend the first couple minutes of my day
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.640]   usually as I journal or do something like that,
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.240]   or sometimes just with my eyes closed,
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.160]   just pleasantly facing in the direction
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.480]   of the 10,000 lux white light
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.680]   and the red light near infrared light.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.840]   And I must say, again, this is anecdotal,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.720]   but that the combination of the two,
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.800]   not only does it certainly wake you up,
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.720]   the white light will do that alone.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.900]   We know the biological basis for that.
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:37.440]   But I have noticed a tremendous improvement
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.920]   in energy, mood, focus, et cetera,
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.920]   that comes from the addition
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.480]   of this red light near infrared light.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.120]   - This is not an advertisement for red light
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.000]   near infrared light, I promise.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.680]   Although this podcast does have a relationship
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.220]   to a medical grade red light devices.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.480]   But I mentioned this because what I'm trying
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.440]   to simulate there is sunlight,
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440]   but I still get outside and get sunlight.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.400]   So I just mentioned this setup because it seems to me
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.760]   that hospitals should be able to create this setup
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.560]   for a minimum of cost.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.680]   Certainly less costs than it takes
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.680]   to maintain a patient for one day.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.520]   - Exactly.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   I mean, the cost of maintaining a patient
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.800]   for inpatient care is so high.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.600]   Medical staff, the disposables,
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.440]   the actual disposing of the disposables,
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.640]   the janitorial staff, the cafeteria.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.420]   I mean, hospital costs are outrageously high.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.640]   Now, of course, people will hear this and think,
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.400]   well, that's exactly what hospitals want, right?
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.480]   Like the longer you stay, it's like a hotel,
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.560]   the longer that you stay,
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.340]   the longer they can charge you or your insurance.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.460]   And I'm not a conspiracy theory type,
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:43.360]   but it is interesting that for many people,
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.780]   they associate going to a hospital
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.560]   with staying a long time and getting sicker.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.600]   Sometimes they get better and go home, thank goodness.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.880]   You're certainly a well-meaning doctor.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.720]   The nursing staff are well-meaning people.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.080]   - Yes.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.480]   - Put simply, why don't hospitals include light therapy
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.480]   given the abundance of data on circadian rhythms
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.320]   and light therapy?
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.200]   And I'll just attach one more thing.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.960]   My audience always gets upset at the duration
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.080]   of these questions/editorials,
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.660]   but this is my wheelhouse, this whole light thing.
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.820]   So I can't help myself.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.940]   There's also something known as ICU psychosis.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:16.780]   - Absolutely.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.960]   - Which is when people who are perfectly mentally healthy
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.540]   go into a hospital because of the relationship to light
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.180]   and the disruption in circadian rhythm
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.220]   from the overhead lights,
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.940]   the checking of the patient in the middle of the night,
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:28.620]   the disruption in sleep, et cetera.
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.100]   People literally develop psychosis that resolves itself
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.900]   the moment they get home and get onto a normal schedule.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.620]   And it's well-known that the patients
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.560]   that are in a hospital bed next to a window
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.460]   don't experience this to the same degree, if at all.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.920]   So it's sort of like, I feel like we're sitting
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.700]   under an avalanche, not a waterfall,
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:51.380]   but an avalanche of data telling us what we need to do.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.220]   And like, forgive me, but like, what the hell is going on?
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.060]   - Exactly.
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.580]   So I can tell you that not only do you have less likely
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.620]   to get this type of ICU psychosis,
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:05.380]   but the data actually shows that people who are
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.980]   in a two-bed room that are next to the window
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.220]   actually discharge from the hospital faster.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.860]   And you say, ah, well, maybe that's the reason.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.020]   Well, it's interesting because the financial incentives
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.900]   with hospitals is not monolithic.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.620]   Some hospitals and their relationship
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.380]   to the insurance companies are at a situation
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.940]   where when a patient comes into the hospital
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.000]   and the physician diagnoses them,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.440]   the insurance will pay the hospital a certain amount
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.220]   of money for that diagnosis, and that's that.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.740]   And also there's something called
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:41.100]   sub-capitative arrangements where the hospital
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:43.260]   has a contract with an insurance company
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:47.060]   to take care of 30,000 people per member per month.
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.460]   And if that patient gets admitted to the hospital,
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.620]   that hospital has to take care of that patient,
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.280]   whatever the costs are.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.780]   So it basically takes the risk now
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.460]   and puts it from the insurance company
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.220]   onto the healthcare provider.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:02.340]   So in those situations, you'll see a hospital
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:05.060]   having an army of case managers.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.140]   They come down every day.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.620]   What are we doing for this patient?
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:08.860]   What do we need to do to get this patient
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:09.680]   out of the hospital?
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.380]   So they're motivated to get people out.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.260]   And so when I say that, I'm even more bewildered
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.460]   than when you said at the beginning,
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:21.020]   well, if we have good data that shows that light therapy
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.020]   and light, getting people out into the sun
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.460]   actually can improve the discharge.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.780]   We had that, as I said, that study from Brazil
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:32.180]   where there was a randomized controlled trial
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.820]   and they used 15 minutes of,
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:35.420]   they actually made this jacket
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.500]   that they put on the patients
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.540]   and they flipped it on with some patients
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.940]   and they didn't flip it on with others.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.580]   - The jacket was a light jacket?
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.980]   - It was an LED jacket that was giving light out
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.140]   at 940 nanometers, infrared light.
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.620]   So you can't even tell if it's on.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.460]   And as I said, the milliwatts per square centimeter
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.620]   was like 2.9.
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.740]   So you wouldn't even feel it.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.040]   But yet these patients, when they were done,
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.120]   seven days, 15 minutes a day,
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.360]   they had better oxygen saturation.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.360]   They could take deeper breaths, longer breaths.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.480]   Their heart rates, their respiratory rates improved.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.520]   Even their lymphocytes improved,
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.240]   the ones that are very important for fighting off COVID-19.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.240]   And so at the very end of all of this,
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.640]   the average length of stay in the control group
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.760]   was 12 days, about 12 days.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.300]   In the intervention group, it was eight days.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.800]   How much does it cost to spend four days in a hospital?
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.640]   - It can be outrageous.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.760]   - It's outrageous, and it's potentially possible.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.960]   And this is why I think, really, people need to understand
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:42.920]   it's not just people who are wanting for their own care,
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.240]   but people who are in charge of hospitals,
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.960]   people who are in charge of healthcare in this country,
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.360]   is understanding that I believe,
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.160]   why I'm happy to talk about this,
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.400]   is I think that the lowest hanging fruit, potentially,
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.640]   after you look at that graph of deaths throughout the year,
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   is encouraging sunlight in people,
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.280]   especially in those that are hospitalized and sick.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.240]   Absolutely.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.200]   I don't know why.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.000]   But I think if somebody were to pick up the baton
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.320]   and decide to do a very simple study
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.660]   where you'd have to hire some nurses that would actually,
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.480]   I've actually thought about doing this study myself,
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:22.040]   is having a unit outside in the sun
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.120]   where people go for literally 20 to 30 minutes
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:24.960]   and they come back.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.600]   You have a whole bunch of nurses there with monitoring
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600]   so that you can make sure the patients are stable.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.680]   And then you send them right back up.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.760]   We send people down at the CAT scanner all the time.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.880]   It takes 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.600]   This is not something that we don't do.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.560]   The difference is you're just sending them outside,
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.680]   hopefully it's warm, it's not too cold,
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.880]   there's nothing bad that happens,
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   and you send them right back up.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.560]   That would be a very easy study to do.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.680]   You could randomize them
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.920]   and then see what happens to their length of stay.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.880]   In my experience, and it's only anecdotal,
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.720]   I have not done the study, it's a world of difference.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.740]   That's for sick people.
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.400]   If we're thinking about health maintenance
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.200]   and health improvement in healthy people
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.560]   who are not in the hospital,
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.320]   which fortunately is most people, it's very clear.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.420]   15 minutes a day of sunlight exposure.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:09.920]   And if you absolutely can't get sunlight exposure,
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.640]   think about some artificial light arrangement
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.560]   that might be beneficial.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.080]   I wanna make sure that we talk about
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.600]   not just sunlight exposure
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:23.160]   and long wavelength light exposure from artificial sources,
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.360]   but the flip side of all this,
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.420]   which is the importance of darkness at night.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.640]   I'm aware of a study published
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.760]   in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.440]   where they basically had kids sleep
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.920]   in either a completely black room
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.320]   or a room that had a hundred lux,
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.000]   this is very dim light, folks,
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.280]   hundred lux light source down in the corner,
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.440]   kind of like a night light,
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.240]   and then looked at morning blood glucose levels.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.120]   And there was a significant difference
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.440]   in the direction of you don't want any light
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.400]   in the room that you're sleeping.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.720]   Now that's hard to do,
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.880]   especially if you're traveling, hotels,
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.840]   but eye masks in particular,
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.760]   silk or even faux silk eye mask,
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.760]   which are very comfortable, can essentially provide that.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.920]   It's very clear that it's the light exposure to the eyes.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.480]   What, if anything, do you recommend for people
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.840]   who are basically living in an environment
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.320]   that's too bright at night
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.440]   do you yourself use like blackout curtains?
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.000]   I mean, how rigid?
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.960]   I find that this is the one
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.320]   that's a little bit harder for people.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.160]   You have kids.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:36.280]   I mean, how should we work with these data?
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.880]   And what are your thoughts about the importance
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.040]   of getting things really dark at night?
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.440]   - Yeah, that is the same question
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.360]   and the same problem that I have
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.240]   with people that do night shift
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.840]   because they go home and they're supposed to sleep
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.400]   and it's this daylight outside.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.320]   So what do you do?
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.960]   That's where you get the aluminum foil around the windows.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.800]   That's where you basically have to block out
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.640]   all of that light.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.600]   And then the eye patch, of course,
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.120]   is a nice thing to do as well.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.840]   Realizing though that even when you close your eyes,
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.080]   if there's a light source in the room,
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.840]   people think, "Well, I'll just close my eyes."
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:12.040]   Those photons can go through the eyes,
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.120]   just like we talked about with infrared light,
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.360]   can go through the skin.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.200]   And I don't know if this is true or not,
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.680]   but I've heard even one or two photons of light
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.240]   hitting the back of the retina
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.360]   can cause enough signal to go to the suprachiasmatic nucleus
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.760]   that shut down melatonin production,
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.560]   or at least impair it in some way.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.480]   - Yeah, in experimental conditions,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.920]   that's definitely true.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.280]   I mean, the sensitivity of the human visual system
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.640]   is extraordinary.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.660]   I mean, your rods, the higher sensitivity photoreceptors
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:45.040]   in the back of your eye can detect a single photon,
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.480]   one photon.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.040]   Most people aren't familiar with thinking
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.760]   in photon quantities,
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.640]   so that might not mean anything to them.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.920]   Put differently, and these are wild data
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.880]   from Chuck Zeisler's lab at Harvard Medical School,
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.400]   light suppresses melatonin.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.880]   The question is, how much light do you need?
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:05.200]   Because of the increase in sensitivity of the eye at night,
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.200]   this rod system and these specialized cells
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.800]   that send signals to the circadian clock,
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.680]   15 seconds, 15 seconds of artificial light exposure
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.640]   will significantly quash your melatonin.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.800]   - That's a whiz at night.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.920]   - 15, yeah, right, so if you go to the bathroom,
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.320]   so then people say, "Well, what am I supposed to do?
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.480]   "How do I navigate at night?
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.040]   "And how do I make sure I'm peeing in the toilet?"
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.340]   Especially for men, right?
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:32.480]   And how do I not trip and fall, this kind of thing,
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.480]   and root to the bathroom or getting a glass of water?
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.040]   It's actually, you know, it's funny.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.360]   The answer turns out to be so logical,
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.280]   but you almost have to hear it before you kind of go,
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.380]   "Oh, that makes sense."
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:46.920]   So perfectly fine to use your phone as a flashlight.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.360]   And then people say, "Well, a flashlight's really bright."
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.600]   But yeah, but you're not shining the light into your eyes.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.320]   So looking at your screen dimmed way down
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.960]   in the middle of the night
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.480]   is gonna be very detrimental to the melatonin system,
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.440]   right at the time where you want melatonin high,
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.200]   and other things too.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.680]   But looking at a flashlight shown into the hallway
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.520]   so that you can navigate, very different scenario
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.600]   than it shining directly into your eyes.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.840]   - Makes sense. - So you can,
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.920]   and then there are a number of different red light sources
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:15.960]   that are pretty good,
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.600]   like little red light lamps that are effective.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.520]   Or you can just turn your phone to a red light mode.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.200]   There's a way to do that.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.760]   - Well, I remember a podcast that you had
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:25.880]   probably a couple of years ago,
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.280]   where you had someone, I forgot his name,
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:31.520]   but he said his house was very dark at night,
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.320]   and people would be afraid to go over
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.440]   because he'd be tripping all over.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.400]   - That's my good friend, Dr. Samahir Tart.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.040]   Now, keep in mind that Samahir is
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.360]   the head of the chronobiology unit
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.800]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.760]   So he like literally lives and breathes this stuff.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.600]   The other thing about Samahir, which is interesting,
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.400]   is when I first met Samahir, he was very, very overweight.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.680]   What Samahir may have relayed on that podcast,
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.600]   perhaps not, is that by changing his relationship to light,
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.120]   sunlight, and getting sunlight during the day,
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.360]   and darkness at night, and by the way,
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.220]   he lives in Baltimore at that time,
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.740]   so it's not trivial to do that,
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.500]   and changing his sleep schedule
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.800]   to one of getting into bed around nine or 10 p.m.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.760]   and waking up earlier, as opposed to staying up late
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.180]   and sleeping the equivalent amount
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.560]   into later in the morning.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.120]   He lost over 80 pounds effortlessly.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.520]   His appetite just adjusted because he finally got in tune
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.500]   with his natural circadian cycles.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:29.980]   - And Glenn Jeffrey's work has made me think in my mind,
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.180]   because of the presence of light in that study,
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.620]   and the fact that the glucose was less,
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.120]   it makes me wonder whether or not
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.520]   we really shouldn't be eating only when the sun is up.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.400]   - I agree that we probably should only be eating
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.560]   when the sun is up.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.800]   I myself, I like dinner somewhere around 6, 6.30.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.560]   It's tough for me, but I totally agree.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.520]   If people were willing to meet me for dinner earlier,
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.420]   I'm good.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.880]   Now, it is true that sleep is vastly improved
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.960]   when you haven't eaten in the previous couple of hours.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.160]   It's also true that trying to fall asleep and stay asleep
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.920]   when you have gnawing hunger in your belly is not easy.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.260]   - No, no. - Okay.
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.100]   - Yeah.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.740]   And I would say the other thing is too,
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.820]   is making sure that these rules
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.220]   that we're coming up with here based on physiology
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:15.220]   aren't laws, so that we get so anxious about following them
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:18.580]   that they actually become a detriment.
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:20.820]   There's a point where we just have to do well enough
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.580]   and then move on to the next day,
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.580]   try to do it the next day.
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.260]   - We're human. - Yeah.
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.440]   - I wanna talk about the other aspects of New Start,
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.120]   nutrition, exercise, trust, rest, et cetera.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.920]   But before we do that, I wanna touch on something
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.120]   that I've been curious about for a long time.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.400]   It's somewhat controversial.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.680]   I've stated my stance on this previously,
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.780]   took some heat for it, but maybe I'll revise my stance.
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:52.320]   You see a lot of patients in the ICU with flu.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.960]   Obviously, the flu can be deadly in some circumstances,
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.460]   but for most people that are healthy, generally healthy,
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:04.800]   first of all, how concerning is flu?
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.760]   Should I really be concerned about flu this winter season,
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:10.160]   even though I feel robust?
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.760]   And then the second question is,
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.560]   do you personally get the "flu shot"?
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.080]   I said on a previous podcast that I don't get it,
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.120]   and I took a lot of heat for that.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.860]   I understand that the flu shot does protect
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.380]   against certain forms of flu, not all of them.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:30.520]   That statement was kind of pushed out there
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.740]   by folks saying that I was going against CDC guidelines.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.180]   I'm not going against CDC guidelines.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.220]   People should do as they choose.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.620]   They should just know what they're doing.
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.860]   I've never gotten a flu shot.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:41.660]   I don't know if I've ever gotten the flu,
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.060]   but that's my personal choice.
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.440]   And it's not based on any specific fear of the flu shot.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.380]   It's because it's never been an issue for me.
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.360]   And I'm okay with getting a cold or a flu
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.520]   every couple of years,
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.980]   feeling miserable for a week or two and bouncing back.
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:29:59.940]   I feel like that's good to develop my own antibodies,
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.780]   but maybe I'm thinking about this completely irrationally.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.540]   So do you get the flu shot?
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.820]   Do you recommend the flu shot for healthy people?
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:08.940]   Do you recommend the flu shot
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.020]   for people that are metabolically challenged?
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.340]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.420]   I think it's, and the approach that I take
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:16.900]   is the approach that I take
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.660]   with any intervention in medicine.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.720]   Every intervention in medicine has a benefit
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.140]   and every intervention has a risk, no matter what it is.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:27.260]   So for me, because I work in an intensive care unit
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:28.940]   around sick patients all the time,
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:31.100]   I'm exposed to a lot of flu.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.540]   I mean, you literally walk in and the next day they say,
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.660]   oh, by the way, that guy, yeah, he had the flu.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.700]   So you find out after the fact.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.980]   So for me, I've always, since I've been a physician,
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.060]   I've always gotten the flu shot every single year.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:44.020]   - Do you get it multiple times per season?
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:44.840]   - No, just once.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.100]   - Okay, so at the beginning of the flu season
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:47.860]   when they say flu shot available now.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:52.120]   So it's a mix of antibodies against known strains
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:52.960]   of the flu.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.180]   - Yeah, interesting.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:57.480]   The way that they try to figure out or guess the way it is,
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.880]   because that's what it is, it's a guess,
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.280]   is they look six months earlier
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.400]   to see what happened in the Southern hemisphere
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.880]   and they see what was circulating there
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.040]   and then they believe that's what's gonna be circulating
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:06.880]   in the Northern hemisphere.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.440]   And they do the same in the South.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.760]   They look and see what's circulating up here
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.620]   and they try to figure out what it's gonna be there.
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.520]   So there's usually about three or four different ones
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.360]   that they try to put in there.
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.680]   Ever since 2009, they've tried to put one in there
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.760]   about 2009 because that was a really bad year.
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.880]   We mentioned that in terms of that study on sunlight,
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.480]   but in terms of the side effects as a result of that,
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.560]   it's been pretty bad.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.000]   I mean, to give you an example,
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.680]   I had a patient recently in the intensive care unit.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.920]   This patient came in, very poorly controlled diabetes,
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:40.540]   hemoglobin A1C of like 16, 17, it was very bad.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.760]   And she developed, she got the flu
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.080]   and her immune system was not well.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.200]   She actually also got a very bad fungal infection
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.880]   that was near fatal.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:54.120]   And so that's the typical patient that we're gonna see
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.320]   who's gonna have that type of a bad reaction to the flu.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.440]   People who are immunocompromised,
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.040]   people who are not metabolically healthy,
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.400]   these are the ones that are wide open.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.400]   And so a flu virus is going to do a lot of damage there.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.400]   So what does the flu vaccine do?
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.960]   It gives the immune system an advanced notice
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.520]   of what this antigen is.
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.160]   And that has two effects.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.520]   What a lot of people believe
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.840]   is that it's gonna protect you from ever getting infected.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.940]   That's not the case.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.460]   You can still get infected,
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:29.240]   but what happens is that the symptomatology
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.760]   or the side effects of that infection
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.560]   will be greatly diminished.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.680]   So instead of you being hospitalized, perhaps,
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.220]   maybe you're only coming down with the flu
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:39.320]   and you stay at home.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.080]   A lot of people would say, I got the flu shot
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.000]   and it didn't help, I got the flu anyway.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.920]   What we don't know is how severe that infection
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.560]   would have been in the first place.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.160]   So that's why for people who are immunocompromised,
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.560]   I generally recommend it to get the flu shot.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.320]   - Or people that are exposed to a lot of flu
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.760]   because like you, you work in the ICU.
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:01.760]   But, and if I may, do your kids get the flu shot?
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:05.600]   - Yeah, we give them the flu shot as well.
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.640]   It's more because they're the kids of doctors
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.360]   who might bring home the flu and more than anything else.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.480]   But there was a point where we were not doing it.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.680]   When they're in their teenage years,
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.720]   that's when we start actually giving them the flu shot.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:18.800]   That was just a personal opinion,
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.560]   even though I know it's approved
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.780]   up down to six months of age, I believe.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.800]   - So you started your kids
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.080]   once they were in their teen years.
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.360]   I remember one year, our son, Ryan, he got some virus.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:34.880]   I don't know what it was, but he had very bad diarrhea
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.000]   and we had to take him to the emergency room
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.600]   to actually get an IV and get fluids into him.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.680]   He was very dehydrated.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.560]   I don't know what that was.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.880]   I don't know if it was rotavirus,
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.520]   but something was going around that year.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.400]   So, and he's perfectly healthy.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.040]   So this is something that can happen
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.240]   and you just have to look at the risks and benefits.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.520]   - So if, well, I am telling you
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.360]   that I've never gotten a flu shot.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.740]   Am I being irresponsible as a citizen?
[01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:01.880]   I don't tend, I mean, I go places, I go to restaurants,
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:06.680]   I go to the gym, I've remained healthy for the most part.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.120]   I'm in an occasional sniffle here and there.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.600]   Every couple of years I'll get,
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.120]   it's been a long time actually, now that I think about it.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.080]   - I think irresponsible is probably too strong of a word.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.960]   The way I look at things is through
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.280]   what I call the Swiss cheese model.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.000]   I don't know if you've ever heard of the Swiss cheese model.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:20.840]   - I love Swiss cheese.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.080]   - Okay, so the Swiss cheese model says this.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.960]   Every, if I cut up a bunch of pieces of Swiss cheese,
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.160]   you'll know that every piece has a hole in it, right?
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.640]   Or maybe a couple of holes.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.280]   And if you line up those pieces of Swiss cheese,
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.600]   those holes might be in different places.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.160]   So if you are, let's say you're on one end of those
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.920]   multiple slices of Swiss cheese
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.700]   and little particles are coming through.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.200]   If you have enough pieces of those Swiss cheese,
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.120]   no particles are gonna get through.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.200]   And that's really what we look at in medicine.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.380]   We don't just depend on one slice of Swiss cheese.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:54.200]   Like in the operating room, for instance,
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.560]   we don't wanna have infections.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.380]   So what do we do?
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.240]   We sterilize the instruments.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.540]   But we don't just leave it there, right?
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.200]   We sterilize the skin that we're going to incise.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.080]   We make sure that the room is the right temperature,
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.900]   the right humidity, because that has an effect.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.940]   We make sure it's under positive pressure.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.480]   The surgeon is wearing a mask.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.720]   He's also wearing sterile gloves.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.000]   So we go through, we try to do everything
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.280]   that we can possibly do so that if there is a breakdown
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.840]   in one place, we still have a bunch
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.200]   of other Swiss cheese slices in place.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:22.680]   It's the same thing with the flu and new start.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.280]   So nutrition, exercise, water, all of those things.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.640]   And then at the end, when you've done that for yourself,
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.160]   if you wanna have extra protection,
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.000]   you wanna add on another piece of Swiss cheese,
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.760]   then you, well, you can talk to your doctor,
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.520]   see what the risks and the benefits are,
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.680]   and then make that decision
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.760]   if that's something that's right for you.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:41.860]   - Are there any known risks of the so-called flu shot?
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:44.520]   And if so, what's the percentage risk?
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.620]   - Yeah, well, definitely there are risks
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.080]   in terms of allergies.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.280]   So they should be asking you when you get it,
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.320]   have you ever been allergic to the flu shot before?
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.760]   I mean, you can have anaphylactic shock.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.000]   That's one possibility.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.480]   Of course, you can have that with anything, right?
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.840]   But specifically to the flu,
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.160]   there was actually, interestingly, one year,
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.560]   and I can't remember which year it was,
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.840]   but there was a, I think it was in Europe,
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.120]   and we actually never got it in the United States,
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.860]   but there was a rash of narcolepsy that was occurring.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:17.520]   So something about the flu vaccine was causing a reaction
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.340]   that was causing an autoimmune response,
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.720]   and the antibodies, they believe,
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:25.720]   were acting against where hypocretin is made
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.600]   in the brain, hypothalamus.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.880]   And so they noticed that there was an association.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.540]   I don't know if they actually determined that it was causal,
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.060]   but they stopped that brand.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:40.680]   - I would not want narcolepsy.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.800]   I used to work in a laboratory for a summer
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.400]   that studied narcolepsy.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:47.040]   It was the Laboratory Emmanuel Mignon's lab
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.820]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:51.600]   He and his colleague, Seiji Nishino,
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.400]   identified the hypocretin orexin mutation
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.900]   as the source of narcolepsy.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.800]   And people with narcolepsy,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.960]   people think it's just excessive daytime sleepiness,
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.080]   but anytime they have it, in the extreme examples,
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.640]   when people with narcolepsy
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.800]   have any kind of emotional activation, they fall asleep.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.320]   And they have cataplexy too, so they can't drive.
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:16.220]   They become essentially paralyzed, like a sleep atonia.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:18.120]   Pretty devastating disease.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.600]   So it sounds like that particular strain of the flu shot
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.500]   in Europe was neurotoxic in some way.
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.880]   - Yeah, there was one particular strain.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.400]   We'd never seen it before, never seen it since.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:32.800]   And so, yeah, there are these one-offs, right?
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.600]   But everything has risks.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.960]   And so the example that I give is,
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.560]   look, I'm in the ICU all day,
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.600]   and I'm seeing people occasionally with head bleeds,
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.680]   and they're on a blood thinner.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.600]   But I don't go back to my clinic in the pulmonary office
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.680]   and then take everybody off of blood thinners
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.120]   because we know that blood thinners, epidemiologically,
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.300]   in the long run, actually save lives
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.440]   because they prevent strokes, heart attacks,
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.280]   things of that nature.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.760]   So what we try to do is figure out
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.560]   what's the right individual for this medication,
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:05.600]   or what's the right medicine for this type of situation.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:09.920]   And that requires training, and that requires,
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:10.920]   sometimes you have calculators
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.140]   that can figure out these risks.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:16.720]   - In the winter months when flu levels are high,
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.640]   are you wearing a mask from the moment you walk
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.240]   into the clinic in the morning until when you leave?
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:23.420]   When you walk up to a new patient,
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.420]   if you know they have a flu,
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:29.480]   or if you know they don't have the flu, are you masked up?
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.740]   I mean, this became a big issue around the COVID discussion,
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:38.980]   but to what extent does wearing a conventional mask,
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:42.300]   or even an N95, actually protect you from flu?
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.860]   - Yeah, so the regular surgical masks
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.520]   are very good at preventing things
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.980]   from coming out of your mouth and going to other people,
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:52.040]   or coming onto your mouth if you happen to have one on.
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:54.000]   So in our clinic where we work,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.620]   we actually look at the flu incidence,
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:59.600]   and then we see if it's rising,
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.200]   everybody that comes into that place,
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:05.720]   physicians, patients, everybody puts a mask on to reduce that.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.800]   N95s are a little different in that
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.500]   they don't prevent viruses from coming out of somebody.
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.720]   You may notice when you put an N95 mask on,
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.680]   they may even have a valve that pops open,
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.680]   and gas can come out, respiratory air can come out,
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.040]   or comes out the sides.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.560]   It's when you take a breath in and it seals,
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.920]   now it's filtering that air.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.720]   So N95s are very good for people
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:30.400]   who don't want to get infection
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.160]   and don't have respiratory issues,
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:35.920]   because you're now having to breathe air in through a filter
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.240]   that takes a little bit more work.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.120]   If someone has COPD, which is an obstructive lung disease,
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.240]   or other lung diseases,
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:45.720]   that might not be the best thing to have in those situations.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.400]   So yeah, I do wear a mask.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.520]   I was very careful.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.440]   I know I was coming on your show this winter time,
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.880]   and I was like, there's no way I want to get the flu,
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.160]   and miss getting on to see you.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.000]   So yeah, I wore a mask.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.160]   - Well, thank you for avoiding bringing the flu here.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.520]   It's wild, because ever since I started this podcast,
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.440]   we put out now two episodes a week,
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.920]   full-length episodes on Mondays
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.200]   and the shorter essential episodes on Thursdays.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.120]   So I can't afford to get sick,
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.720]   and I haven't been sick in years.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.800]   I take care to not get sick,
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.520]   but I'm going to think real carefully
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.880]   about this flu shot thing.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.480]   What about hand-washing?
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.240]   Is that, so up front,
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.920]   let me give a little bit of backstory.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.840]   The guy I worked for as a postdoc was an MD, PhD,
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.000]   and he used to joke about the fact
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.360]   that hand-washing did nothing,
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.920]   because he was, in his prior life, he was a surgeon.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.520]   He did a, I think he did a rotation, a surgery rotation.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.320]   He eventually became a neurologist, then a researcher.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:44.760]   And I used to say, "What do you mean?
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.840]   The hand-washing does nothing."
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.160]   And he's like, "Well, have you ever seen
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.600]   what a physician does before surgery?
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.080]   You know, they wash up to their,
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.080]   up to their, basically their shoulders.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.560]   They've got betadine, they glove in properly,
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.320]   and, you know, that's how you prevent infection.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.400]   Washing your hands does nothing, it's a formality."
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:01.760]   And I thought, "There's no way that could be true."
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.160]   Then I started digging around in the literature about this,
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.920]   and it's kind of mixed.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.840]   Like, so to what extent does washing our hands
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.960]   actually help us avoid getting infection?
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.280]   - I, you know, it's a good question.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.960]   And I think it probably comes down to some of the studies
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.400]   are probably not good data,
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.440]   or heterogeneous enough to do a meta-analysis.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.280]   But what's really interesting is how many times a day,
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.440]   if you were to watch yourself,
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.160]   that you touch your nose, you touch your face,
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.640]   and these are the portals for viruses
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:28.920]   to come into your body. - Eyes.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.320]   - Yeah, eyes, nose, mouth, that's where they come.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.600]   And we touch them all the time.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.760]   You touch handles.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.600]   I mean, if you think about it, it's almost,
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.680]   I don't know, creepy.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.880]   - And flu, it is creepy.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:45.840]   And flu and cold can survive out on surfaces for how long?
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.920]   - I'd have to look up the numbers,
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.080]   but it's longer than you might think.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.000]   I know that when we looked at COVID,
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.240]   I know we went crazy at the beginning of the COVID pandemic
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.400]   about wiping things down.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:00.800]   And really, that's not the way it seems to spread
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.720]   for COVID and more airborne things.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:07.720]   But for influenza droplets, that is rotavirus, C. diff,
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:12.240]   that's a clostridium difficile infection of the bowel.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.560]   That's the primary way that it actually spreads.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.920]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.480]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Our Place.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.960]   Our Place makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.640]   Surprisingly, toxic compounds,
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.080]   such as PFASs, or forever chemicals,
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.040]   are still found in 80% of nonstick pans,
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.640]   as well as utensils, appliances,
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.640]   and countless other kitchen products.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.120]   Now, I've talked before on this podcast
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.480]   about these PFASs, or forever chemicals,
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:41.320]   like Teflon, which have been linked to major health issues,
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.440]   such as hormone disruption, gut microbiome disruption,
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.960]   fertility issues, and many other health problems.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.980]   So it's really important to avoid them.
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:51.120]   This is why I'm a huge fan of Our Place.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.220]   Our Place products are made
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:53.720]   with the highest quality materials
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.280]   and are all PFAS and toxin-free.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.220]   I particularly love their Titanium Always Pan Pro.
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.660]   It's the first nonstick pan made
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:03.000]   with zero chemicals and zero coating.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]   Instead, it uses pure titanium.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.320]   This means it has no harmful forever chemicals,
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.760]   and it also doesn't degrade
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.040]   or lose its nonstick effect over time.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.120]   It's extremely durable, and it's also beautiful to look at.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.360]   I cook eggs in my Titanium Always Pan Pro
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.780]   almost every morning.
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.160]   The design allows for the eggs to cook perfectly
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.760]   without sticking to the pan.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.480]   I also cook burgers and steaks in it,
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.400]   and it puts a really nice sear on the meat.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.880]   But again, nothing sticks to the pan,
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.200]   so it's really easy to clean,
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.000]   and it's even dishwasher safe.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.840]   I love it, and I use it every day.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.700]   For a limited time, Our Place is offering

[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:00.360]   Let's talk about water and air.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:04.140]   I think I, like many people, am curious
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:07.060]   as to how much water I drink.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.660]   Is that influencing my susceptibility
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:12.160]   to infections, et cetera?
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:16.580]   Water on the body, water we get into, this kind of thing.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:21.580]   And then air, humidity, temperature, ozone,
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.260]   anything interesting in those?
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:25.640]   Let's talk about water.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:28.660]   So the most obvious one is the internal use of water.
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:30.620]   And what's interesting about that
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:33.780]   is that we actually can do a blood test on people,
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:35.860]   and it's called the sodium concentration.
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:38.380]   One of the first things you learn as a medical student
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:40.860]   is that the sodium concentration in somebody
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.940]   has very little to do with how much sodium
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:43.980]   they take into their body.
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:46.300]   It has much more to do with how much water
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:47.260]   they take into their body.
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:48.540]   So the more water they take in,
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:50.720]   the lower the sodium concentration goes.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:53.200]   But it's very well-regulated.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.340]   There's a study that was done a number of years ago
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:58.380]   that looked at the chances of death,
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:01.380]   so mortality, and sodium concentration.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:04.460]   And as sodium concentration went up,
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.660]   so did the chances of dying.
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:08.500]   So it's important to drink water.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.940]   How much water?
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:13.180]   You know, there's this old eight-glasses-of-water thing.
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:16.420]   It's probably not that much,
[01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:19.220]   but it certainly is important.
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:20.940]   So internal use of water is well-known.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:24.220]   I mean, it's a substrate that allows your kidneys
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:28.660]   to dump toxins, and you need to flush those things out.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:30.500]   And you sweat, especially if you're exercising,
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:31.740]   you're gonna need to take more water in
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.420]   because you're sweating, you're breathing faster,
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:36.700]   you have something called insensible losses of water.
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:40.100]   But I think the other part of water
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.220]   that I'd like to talk about
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.700]   is not the internal use of water,
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.540]   which is pretty obvious, and the data's there,
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.640]   but the external use of water.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.220]   And the reason why I bring that up
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.380]   is in the context of what we're talking about,
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:54.220]   which is illnesses, and flus, and viruses.
[01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:55.660]   One of the properties of water
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:46:00.060]   that is very, very important is its high enthalpy.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:00.900]   What does that mean?
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:03.260]   It means it takes a lot of energy
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:09.260]   to raise water, the substance, one degree Celsius.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.660]   And the opposite is also true.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:13.580]   So if you put warm water on someone,
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.600]   it can transfer a lot of energy into that person
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.780]   without losing temperature.
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:20.220]   Why is that important?
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:21.660]   If you want to use,
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.140]   if you want to increase someone's body temperature,
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.000]   water is a very good way of doing it.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.560]   If you've ever gone into a sauna, and it's a dry sauna,
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:33.260]   you haven't yet put the little ladle onto the heating,
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:38.260]   you can tolerate 170, 180 degree sauna pretty well.
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:40.420]   As soon as you put that water on,
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:42.300]   the heat just starts to come down on you.
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:45.460]   And that's because water is such a very good way
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:48.100]   of transmitting that heat.
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:49.900]   So why is that important?
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.180]   Let's put that away for a little bit,
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.600]   and I'll explain why that's important.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.100]   Let's switch gears and talk about viruses
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.560]   in the immune system.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.680]   So your immune system is divided into two components,
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.980]   an innate immune system and an adaptive immune system.
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:06.400]   The adaptive immune system is what we've all learned about
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.900]   in terms of vaccines and antibodies
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:10.060]   and all the things that the discussion
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.360]   that we've had the last four or five years.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.380]   You see something very specific, your immune system does,
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:17.420]   and it makes an antibody directly against that.
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.020]   If it's slightly different,
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:22.020]   the antibody response is not gonna be as effective.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.560]   So it's very highly tuned, very specific.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:27.400]   That's the adaptive immune system.
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:29.200]   The innate immune system, on the other hand,
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.580]   is the one that goes out first, gobbles things up,
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:35.800]   and presents it to the adaptive immune system.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.660]   But there's also something else in the innate immune system
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.340]   that's very important, and that is the system
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.840]   that has to do with recognizing damaged molecules
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.220]   and recognizing pathological molecules.
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:52.320]   There are certain pathological patterns, PAMPs,
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.600]   pathological associated molecular patterns,
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.760]   that the innate immune system recognizes
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.760]   without ever having seen it.
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.720]   And it can take those things out.
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:03.220]   And the greatest tool that the innate immune system
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:06.760]   has to take those things out is something called interferon.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.520]   Interferon's an extremely important molecule.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.520]   It has a very wide-ranging ability to take out viruses.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.280]   Something that's important to understand
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:20.320]   is that with all of the variants
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.360]   that we've been talking about with COVID,
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.920]   with all of the different strains that we have of influenza,
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.720]   none of that matters with interferon.
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.120]   Interferon has very wide,
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.040]   and that's why it's such an important molecule.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.120]   It's been said that the immune system is so well-designed
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:42.240]   that there are no viruses that can infect it
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:44.800]   unless they have countermeasures.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.840]   And that is absolutely true.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.240]   This was first seen when SARS-CoV-2 came out.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:51.040]   They looked at SARS-CoV-1,
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.800]   the original one that came out in 2002.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.920]   And sure enough, that virus, SARS-CoV-1,
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.100]   if you want to call it that, or just SARS,
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:05.100]   had a mechanism contained within it to neutralize
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.340]   and to suppress the secretion of interferon.
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:11.440]   They did some searching, and they looked at SARS-CoV-2,
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:16.440]   and sure enough, MAC1, which is a gene in SARS-CoV-2,
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.660]   is a gene that is specifically, I don't want to say designed,
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.680]   but it's there to get around interferon.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:27.760]   That should tell you how important interferon is.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.880]   So with that in mind,
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.560]   let's go back to our talk about water and temperature.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:34.200]   There was a number of studies that had been done
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.200]   looking at temperature, interferon, and what they showed.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.880]   This was an in vitro study where they took lymphocytes,
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:47.720]   they put it into a medium, and they bathed it in LPS.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:52.480]   LPS is basically a molecule that is seen in bacteria
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.520]   that usually sets off the immune system.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.880]   So you have lymphocytes, you have LPS,
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:57.720]   and then what they did was
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.520]   they slowly increased the temperature,
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.320]   and they measured interferon.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.000]   Once it hit 39 degrees Celsius,
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.800]   there was a tenfold increase in interferon secretion
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.500]   from the lymphocytes.
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.480]   39 degrees for those who are on the Fahrenheit system,
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.040]   that's about 102.2, okay, so.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:15.880]   - Slight fever.
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.240]   - Slight fever, yeah, or a good fever, yeah, good fever.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:23.340]   So what does this mean?
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:25.900]   This means that, and this gets into the whole discussion
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:27.960]   philosophically about fevers in general.
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:28.800]   - Should you block them, should you not?
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.480]   - Exactly, and I'll tell you, in the hospital,
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:32.640]   I'll get so many calls,
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.600]   "Hey, doctor, this patient has a fever."
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:39.600]   And the idea is is that the fever is part of the problem,
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:42.620]   and we need to fix the fever 'cause it's part of the problem.
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:45.160]   By the way, that was the same thought process
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.600]   in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that we had.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.940]   Aspirin had just been discovered, Bayer aspirin, 1899,
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:56.600]   and it was great, it seemed,
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.880]   because aspirin took away fever,
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.000]   it took away the body aches, it took away the pain,
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.880]   and all of that was subscribed to the virus
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.720]   that was going on.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:06.840]   They didn't even know it was a virus,
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:08.880]   just the influenza disease.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:12.000]   And so it was being used almost excessively,
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.940]   in fact, in many cases, probably toxically.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.000]   In these army hospitals in 1918,
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.960]   people were coming in with the flu,
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.500]   young people were coming in with the flu,
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.160]   and they were getting high doses of aspirin,
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.800]   they thought this was the way to treat it,
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.960]   and the mortality rate, the case fatality rate
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:29.760]   was like 6%, it might've been even higher than that.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.680]   So getting back to water, external use of water,
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:40.680]   here is a way to deliver large amounts of energy
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:44.640]   that can be stored in water as a substance
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.080]   to the patient to elevate,
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.900]   to actually help elevate body temperature,
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:54.560]   to see whether or not we can improve the innate immune system
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:57.440]   to actually help out in that type of a situation.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.040]   - So we're talking about hot baths?
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.040]   - Hot baths, sauna.
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:01.880]   - Hot shower?
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.040]   - Hot showers.
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:07.360]   Probably the most effective way of doing it
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:09.760]   is in the old term, and again,
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.320]   something that was used 100 years ago
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.980]   is hydrotherapy or hot fomentations,
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:15.240]   is the term that you'll find.
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:16.640]   If you look at the old literature,
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.040]   this is where they would get hot towels,
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.360]   linen towels, they would soak it in water,
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.040]   they would heat it up, usually in a stove,
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.760]   but you could do the same thing in a microwave.
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:27.160]   The big thing is that you have to make sure
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.280]   you don't burn yourself.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.160]   - Or the house down.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:32.400]   - Exactly, and so you would put a protective layer
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:35.640]   of a batting or cloth on the patient,
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:37.360]   and this would go on top of them,
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.160]   and you would basically cover them up
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.960]   until you started to see them sweat,
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.920]   and you'd do that for about 20 minutes.
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.040]   Once you start to see them sweat,
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:45.920]   you know that you're elevating the body temperature
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:49.160]   above the set point, and what that's supposed to do
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:54.080]   is to activate the immune system to secrete interferon.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.920]   Look, we have studies, there was a study
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:57.920]   that was published a couple of years ago,
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.760]   looking at COVID, giving exogenous interferon
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:06.020]   to people with COVID-19 reduced hospitalizations by 50%.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:06.860]   So you're getting around--
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.520]   - You can take exogenous interferon?
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:09.360]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.680]   - You take it as a pill?
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:13.360]   - It's an infusion, you would digest it in the stomach.
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.280]   So this was an infusion that they gave to patients.
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:18.600]   - I'm surprised that I haven't heard
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.100]   of like peptide clinics selling interferon.
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:25.320]   Can you inject interferon subcutaneously?
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.400]   - You can, and this was actually published
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.280]   in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:31.440]   It was Interferon Lambda, I believe,
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:35.040]   and it was a phase three trial
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.160]   looking at getting FDA approval.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.800]   I think probably because of the fact
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.200]   that we weren't having as many hospitalized patients,
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:42.120]   it probably hasn't gone through,
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:45.880]   but in that study, it reduced hospitalizations by 50%.
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.160]   - Wow.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:50.940]   For those that don't have access to interferon infusions
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:54.140]   or a sauna or even a bath,
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:56.720]   so what is it, you know, a five to 10 minute hot shower,
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.960]   then get under the blankets, this kind of thing.
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:03.960]   I mean, this is kind of good old mom's advice kind of stuff.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.200]   - Isn't it interesting?
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.600]   So I'll tell you what the protocol was.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.440]   There was, and actually this is quite interesting.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.480]   Historically, there were a number of sanitariums
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.840]   in the Northeast of the United States
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.140]   back at that time of the century.
[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:18.960]   And they were run by the Adventist Church
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:22.320]   and their way of dealing with the pandemic was different.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.960]   They were not using drug medications.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.700]   They were using hydrotherapy and sunlight,
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:28.080]   some of the things that we've been talking about here.
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.440]   And there was a guy by the name of Wells Rubel
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:34.760]   who was the medical director of the New England Sanitarium.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.840]   And he said, "Let's just take a look
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:36.760]   "and see what's going on here.
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.800]   "Let's pool the 10 sanitariums in this area,
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:41.460]   "see what's gone on in terms of the way
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.940]   "we treat the patients and then look at the published data
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:46.660]   "from the army hospitals."
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:47.700]   And there was a stark difference.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.660]   He divided it into two sections.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:53.180]   The first phase of influenza is the early phase.
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:56.540]   And the major endpoint of that early phase
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:57.980]   was did they get pneumonia?
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:00.940]   Okay, and then from pneumonia,
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:03.020]   the second endpoint after that was the second phase.
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.700]   And that was, the question was, did they die?
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:10.140]   So where the sanitarium seemed to do a much better job
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:13.780]   than in the army hospitals was in that first phase.
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:18.780]   They had 1/6 of the people actually go to the pneumonia phase.
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.820]   So what were they doing?
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:22.020]   Immediately, they were doing hydrotherapy.
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:23.700]   Immediately, they were doing,
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.580]   which was basically increasing body temperature,
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:27.220]   doing fever types of treatments,
[01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:28.580]   getting them out into the sunlight.
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:31.500]   You can remember, maybe in your mind's eye,
[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.740]   these photographs of these army hospitals
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:36.940]   or these army camps and the tents were outside
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:38.240]   'cause they didn't have any place to put them
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.460]   in some of these cases.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:40.500]   So the sunlight was good,
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.220]   but the thing that they weren't doing was the hydrotherapy.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:46.580]   Once they got to the pneumonia stage,
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:48.060]   there was no difference
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:49.620]   between what the sanitariums were doing
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.460]   and the army hospitals.
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.300]   The mortality was 50%.
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:54.900]   Remember, this is prior to penicillin.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:56.020]   This is 1918.
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:59.380]   This is before 1928 when we discovered penicillin.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:02.740]   So once you hit pneumonia, it was really difficult to treat.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.260]   So he actually wrote this up,
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:07.180]   and I actually found it in a, someone directed it to me.
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:08.640]   They actually showed it to me.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:11.340]   It was in a, it wasn't even in a scientific journal
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.180]   that he published it in.
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:14.900]   It was some sort of periodical called "Life and Health."
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:16.980]   May 1st, 1919, I still remember it in my head.
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.900]   And he says, "Hey, this is what we did.
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:19.960]   "This is what they did."
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:24.960]   They had 1/6 of the mortality in their institution.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:27.420]   And this was repeated multiple times.
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:30.700]   This is not done in isolation.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.660]   Let's lead you up to the big thing here.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:35.140]   There was a Nobel Prize that was given for this.
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:39.300]   In 1927, Jules Wagner-Jurek
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:42.740]   was a Austrian psychiatrist
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:47.740]   who noticed that in his patients that had neurosyphilis,
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.300]   that when they had a fever, their symptoms improved.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:55.100]   So this is, again, prior to penicillin.
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:58.700]   He actually took patients with malaria,
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:00.860]   and he took the blood from these patients
[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:04.140]   and carefully infected his neurosyphilis patients
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:05.520]   with malaria.
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:07.120]   And of course, you know that malaria
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:09.420]   causes very, very high fevers.
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:14.420]   He cured neurosyphilis by causing fevers from malaria.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:16.840]   - Wild.
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:20.380]   And all he really had to do was heat them up.
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:21.980]   - There was many ways of doing it at the time.
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:24.980]   Heat closets, sometimes they would inject foreign proteins
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:26.060]   to create a fever.
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:28.220]   This was another way of doing it with malaria.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:29.060]   Of course, at the time,
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.060]   they had the treatment for malaria, right?
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:31.900]   Quinine.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:34.300]   - Well, and LPS will do this, right?
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.200]   LPS, as you mentioned, is lipid polysaccharide.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:41.000]   I think they get it from yeast cell wall or something.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.880]   - Yes, it's a foreign antigen.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:46.720]   - Yeah, it's a contaminant in a lot of gray market peptides
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.160]   and things that I suggest people don't take.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.400]   You know, there are a lot of people now
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.840]   who are interested in peptides
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:53.360]   and they buy them on the gray market,
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:56.920]   and it says not for human or animal use
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.520]   research purposes only.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:01.720]   And people often say, well, why not use those?
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:03.880]   You know, why do people have to go through a physician
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:05.140]   and a compounding pharmacy
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:08.140]   if they're going to explore that territory at all?
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:10.460]   And the reason is it's very clear
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:15.140]   that most of the gray market peptides have LPS in them.
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:17.520]   So small amounts, but injected repeatedly over time,
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.300]   people start getting the systemic inflammation
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:20.300]   and fever response.
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:21.780]   - There you go.
[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:23.060]   - You know, that's a little bit of a tangent,
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:25.140]   but it gets to the same mechanism.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:30.140]   So when you say the use of water in this context,
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:32.060]   it's really about trying to heat up
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.740]   the core temperature of the body.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:34.580]   - Exactly.
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:37.100]   - Okay, and so when we think about Russian banyas,
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:38.580]   which I'm a huge fan of, you know,
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.780]   there's a bunch of them in different cities.
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:43.220]   Whenever I'm in New York,
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:46.780]   I go to this place down on Wall Street, Spy 88.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:47.860]   I have no relation to them.
[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:51.480]   And they have a medium hot sauna for Russians.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:52.820]   Medium hot is very hot.
[01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:55.340]   It's like a spice in certain restaurants.
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:59:00.260]   You know, you have to calibrate to the local ethnicity.
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.340]   And then they have very hot sauna.
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:04.380]   And what they do there, even when they're not sick,
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:06.100]   is they'll go from, you know,
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:09.460]   a moderately hot to hot to steam,
[01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:11.020]   and then back to a hot, hot sauna,
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:12.540]   then into cold water.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.740]   So they're doing heat, cold contrast therapy.
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:17.900]   And, you know, the Eastern Europeans and Russians
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:20.660]   and Scandinavians have been doing this for centuries.
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.500]   - Absolutely.
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.220]   - Here, we think of it as like biohacking
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:25.020]   and this new domain of health,
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:26.820]   but this has been going on for a very long time.
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:30.020]   - So in my mind, anthropologically,
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:32.980]   I'm wondering those cultures
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:36.700]   that don't have access to the sunlight that we have here,
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:39.300]   maybe they use this as a way of supplementing that.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:40.260]   'Cause we don't see- - In winter.
[01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:41.100]   - In winter, right.
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:42.060]   So we don't see that.
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:43.660]   We don't see a lot of sauna use
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.140]   near the equator in any kind of culture.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:46.060]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:47.160]   I'm sure they exist down there,
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:49.460]   but I feel like Brazil in the summertime
[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.260]   probably feels like a sauna.
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:52.920]   So you don't need a sauna, right?
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:56.740]   Whereas Siberia in winter probably feels a lot
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:58.860]   like the way I imagine Siberia in winter.
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:01.900]   If you look at probably the biggest purveyor
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:03.900]   of this type of therapy that we're talking about,
[02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:06.580]   hydrotherapy, was at the Battle Creek Sanitarium
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:08.580]   in Battle Creek, Michigan.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:10.800]   And they had whole protocols for this.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.780]   And when I looked it up,
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:16.260]   the general protocol for this was 20 minutes of hot
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:19.100]   followed by a very, very short,
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:22.240]   probably a minute of cold
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.620]   that involves some sort of physical rubbing
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:30.220]   or sort of abrasion on the chest.
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:31.820]   Okay, and when I saw that,
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:34.620]   it's like I immediately thought of what they do in Finland
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:36.220]   and where they hit themselves with-
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.740]   - Yeah, the Russians use these eucalyptus branches.
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:41.580]   - Eucalyptus.
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:44.000]   - And it's the, it is, it's eucalyptus branches.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.460]   I call it, I think it's called platsa
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:46.620]   or something like that.
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:47.680]   - Yeah.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:49.900]   - And yeah, it costs a little bit more,
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:51.780]   but if you go to one of these Russian banya's,
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:54.020]   you can pay someone who's skilled in this.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.260]   They basically make you lie down
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:57.020]   and you cover your face and groin,
[02:00:57.020 --> 02:01:00.380]   and then they hit you with these eucalyptus branches.
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.180]   Not to smack you with them,
[02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:05.020]   but the idea is that in the sauna,
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:09.540]   you're gonna bring some of the additional vasodilation
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:11.860]   to the surface of the skin.
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:13.540]   So you're getting more blood flow to the periphery
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:14.500]   is the idea.
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.620]   I don't know if there's any truth to it, but-
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:19.700]   - My understanding from what I've heard and read
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:21.660]   is that obviously the heat part
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:23.140]   is to heat up the core body temperature.
[02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:26.060]   And that has a whole host of responses,
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:28.300]   which I'll touch on after this,
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:30.940]   that I read a recent article that was just amazing.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:34.820]   But the cold part of it is gonna cause vasoconstriction,
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.980]   and we know this in medicine.
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:39.060]   We're actually taught this in medical school,
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:40.980]   that a cold shower, vasoconstriction,
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:43.980]   causes demargination of the white blood cells
[02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.220]   that are actually attached
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:46.900]   to the inside of your blood vessels,
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:49.260]   and it knocks them into circulation.
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.820]   So if you think about this, what is it that you're doing?
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:54.460]   When you're doing the heat aspect and the fever goes up
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:56.700]   and the temperature is basically,
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.660]   it's a non-hormonal signal to the entire body
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:03.180]   to start up regulation and transcription.
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:05.020]   And then the very last thing is the cold.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:05.860]   Now, what does that do?
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:08.860]   Number one, it knocks those cells into circulation
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:10.180]   to go wherever they need to go.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.020]   That's number one.
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:14.140]   And number two, vasoconstriction peripherally,
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:15.660]   which is what you will see,
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:17.860]   prevents that heat that you've just built up
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:21.020]   from going out to the periphery and being lost.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:23.580]   So it kind of locks the heat in, in a sense,
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:25.420]   allowing that heat to last longer.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:27.140]   - Amazing.
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:28.900]   Could you just repeat one more time,
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.060]   even though you said it incredibly clearly,
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:37.580]   this phenomenon of how the white blood cells are liberated
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:39.020]   by cold and constriction?
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:40.500]   - Yeah, so when you have,
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:43.660]   imagine a tube that's lined with white blood cells.
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:46.700]   They all have little podocytes, little things that attach.
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:48.420]   And what happens when you have vasoconstriction
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:49.940]   is it causes vasoconstriction.
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:52.940]   It shrinks down because of the smooth muscle in the wall.
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:55.420]   And you have release of these white blood cells
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:56.660]   into the circulation.
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:59.460]   And that's called demargination.
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:00.900]   So after a cold shower,
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:02.500]   you will actually be able to see,
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.340]   and this is kind of a trick question,
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.380]   does one's white blood cell count go up
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:09.020]   after a cold shower?
[02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:10.300]   The answer is, technically,
[02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:12.020]   you have the same number of white cells,
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:14.460]   but now they're just more of them in the circulation.
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:17.140]   So yes, the number that you get back on the lab test
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:18.420]   shows that it's gone up.
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:19.500]   - And the white blood cells,
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:21.020]   for those that aren't familiar,
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:22.580]   they essentially go out and-
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:25.460]   - Yeah, these are the macrophages, the neutrophils.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:28.300]   These are all different branches, if you will,
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:30.260]   of the arm forces of your body
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:33.220]   that go out to try to find things and neutralize them.
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:35.980]   - And this is part of the innate immune response.
[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:37.860]   This is not, so- - Yes, both actually.
[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:39.180]   - White blood cells, right.
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:40.100]   White blood cells are involved
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:42.420]   in the adaptive immune response as well.
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:46.020]   Amazing, I've never heard of deliberate cold exposure
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:48.700]   being used to liberate white blood cells in that way,
[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:49.820]   but it makes perfect sense.
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:51.580]   It sounds like it's largely mechanical.
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:54.820]   - It is, and it also may seem to be mechanical
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.580]   in terms of locking that heat in.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:00.460]   So one of the things that I always was puzzled about
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:03.140]   is I don't know how many people are able
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:06.980]   to really get their core body temperature up to 102.2.
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:08.260]   I mean, it's possible.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:09.740]   You'd have to really try to do it.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:13.460]   And then I came across a paper that was incredible.
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:16.340]   And this was a paper where they actually looked at mice,
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:17.500]   which, by the way, I looked this up.
[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:19.340]   They actually have the same target temperatures
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:20.620]   that humans have.
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:24.340]   And also hamsters, and again, same target temperature.
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:26.180]   And what they showed in this,
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:28.060]   they looked at the innate immune system
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.700]   and the signaling that's required
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:31.620]   for the secretion of interferon.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.940]   And they looked at STAT and JAK.
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:37.060]   These were the two areas or signaling.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:41.460]   And what they showed was essentially that,
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:42.820]   whereas before I had told you
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:45.980]   that you had to go up to 39 degrees Celsius
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:49.420]   to get a tenfold increase in interferon secretion,
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:55.300]   what they did was they looked at 36, 37, 38, and 39,
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:05:00.300]   and they saw a jump going from 37 to 38.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:01.980]   So in other words, at 38 degrees,
[02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:04.700]   which is only 100.4 Fahrenheit,
[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:07.820]   there was a dramatic increase in the signaling
[02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:10.420]   in probably six or seven different areas
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:13.860]   of the STAT and the JAK system signaling.
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:15.340]   When they did further analysis,
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:17.020]   they said, what's going on here?
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:19.780]   Is it the lack of breakdown of mRNA?
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.140]   What's actually happening?
[02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:22.580]   This is the conclusion that they came to
[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:25.340]   after they did all the molecular studies.
[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:29.180]   It was simply just the increase in temperature
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:32.140]   that was causing an increase in transcription
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:33.060]   in the nucleus.
[02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:34.620]   - Transcription of-
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:35.500]   - Of the proteins.
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:36.700]   - Leading to more interferon.
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:37.540]   - Correct.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:39.580]   So we're talking about not the transcription
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.260]   of the protein interferon,
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:42.760]   but the transcription of the factors
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:46.220]   that regulates the increase in interferon, yeah.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:49.920]   So it was basically transcription in the nucleus
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:53.020]   is actually upregulated itself by nothing else
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:55.580]   other than temperature.
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:57.160]   - I love it.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:59.540]   One thing that people might wanna play with a little bit,
[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:01.420]   although they should be careful, right?
[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:04.180]   If you're pregnant, forget the sauna for a while.
[02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:05.020]   - Yeah, I-
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:05.840]   - You know, if you're-
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:06.680]   - Absolutely.
[02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:08.160]   - You know, everyone has different thresholds
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.780]   for heat tolerance and cold tolerance,
[02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:12.740]   but spend a little time in a Russian banya
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:13.980]   and you'll soon realize
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:16.380]   that they all wear these like wool hats.
[02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:17.220]   - Yes.
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:18.040]   - And you might think,
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:18.880]   "Oh, well, that's just gonna heat you up more."
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:20.780]   No, it insulates you against the heat.
[02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:22.140]   And so you can stay in much longer
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:24.060]   because the signal to get out,
[02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:27.860]   like that it's going too hot is a brain signal first.
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:28.700]   - Oh, wow.
[02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:29.540]   - Which makes sense, right?
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.820]   And your brain basically evokes something
[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:33.340]   analogous to the gasp reflex
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:35.380]   when you're not getting enough oxygen, right?
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:36.200]   - Okay.
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.620]   - So if you go in there with a towel on your head
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.460]   or you cover your head,
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:41.980]   what you find is that you can sit comfortably
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:43.900]   at much hotter temperatures in the sauna.
[02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:44.740]   - Got it.
[02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:46.220]   - That could be a problem, right?
[02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:47.460]   'Cause you don't wanna burn your skin.
[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:50.960]   But the sauna actually provides a lot more degrees
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:54.100]   of freedom and exploration safely than does hot bath.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:56.260]   Because if you get into a bath that's truly too hot,
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:57.220]   you'll burn your skin.
[02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:58.060]   - Correct.
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:06:59.300]   - Right, whereas in the sauna, you know,
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:01.260]   you might go into a very hot sauna.
[02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:02.180]   I'm very heat tolerant.
[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:03.940]   I don't like the cold so much, but I do it anyway.
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:05.340]   But I'm very heat tolerant.
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:08.820]   But when I first hit a, you know, a 210 degree sauna,
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:10.520]   which is very, very warm sauna,
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:14.660]   if your head isn't covered, your heart starts racing.
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:16.360]   You feel like you want out of there.
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:19.220]   If you go in there wearing a, like a wool beanie cap.
[02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:20.060]   - Yeah.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:20.900]   - You're like, you're fine.
[02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:21.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:22.560]   - You're fine because the brain signal
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:23.900]   doesn't get kicked off for a while.
[02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:26.060]   - So that's interesting because I've seen
[02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:28.500]   some old photographs of when they used to do this,
[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:31.740]   like in mass in the big hospitals back East 100 years ago.
[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.340]   And there was these treatment rooms
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:36.300]   and each of the treatment rooms had a little hole in,
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:38.100]   not a little hole, but a hole enough to put your head.
[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:39.540]   And so it was kind of funny
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:41.500]   'cause you see this long hallway
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:44.680]   and all of these humans heads kind of sticking out of a hole
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.700]   while the treatment was going on inside the room,
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.220]   their heads were outside the room.
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:51.660]   - You know, it's so amazing how humans find
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:54.040]   the same solutions through different portals.
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:54.880]   - It is true.
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:55.700]   - I'm fascinated by this.
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:56.540]   You know, every once in a while,
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:58.580]   I sit back from the information that we touch on
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:00.740]   in this podcast since we launched in 2021.
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:03.980]   And I think, you know, there are so many different tools
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:08.540]   and protocols and you're providing additional ones today.
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:13.540]   They almost all fall into about six to 10 batches.
[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:15.780]   And whether one comes through
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:17.860]   the portal of traditional Western medicine
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:20.100]   or Eastern medicine or what the, you know,
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:22.260]   Finns or the Russians do or what they do,
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:23.580]   it's so interesting that, you know,
[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:26.100]   we're talking light, temperature,
[02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:27.980]   and these things obviously relate,
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:30.180]   hydration, which I'm sure we'll talk about,
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:33.500]   mitochondria, cellular metabolism.
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:36.300]   I mean, you know, there isn't an infinite number
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:38.420]   of conceptual themes and they tend to sort of
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:39.260]   batch into them.
[02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:40.300]   And I think understanding those themes
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:42.420]   helps people make decisions.
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:44.260]   Like if you're on the road and you're feeling run down
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:45.780]   after getting off the plane
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:46.940]   and you're thinking you might be coming down
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:49.300]   with something, you get that little throat tickle.
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.360]   You know, you only have access to a hot shower.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:52.580]   That's your best bet, do that.
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:54.140]   Like you don't need a sauna.
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.260]   Ideally, you're getting sunlight.
[02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.100]   You don't have sunlight.
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:57.980]   You can, you know, take some of the other measures
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:00.400]   that we were talking about before.
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:02.580]   Yeah, I find it fascinating that humans
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:04.380]   eventually converge on the same answers.
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:05.980]   It just sort of varies in terms
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:07.220]   of what you call these things.
[02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:08.060]   Exactly.
[02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:08.900]   You call it hydrotherapy.
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:09.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:10.560]   I call it deliberate heat exposure,
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:11.620]   deliberate cold exposure.
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:13.260]   If you're, you know, in some cases.
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:14.500]   And people from all over the world
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.500]   and different cultures have talked to me
[02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.460]   in Asia, in the Middle East.
[02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:19.300]   And they say, you know what?
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.700]   My grandmother, my mother,
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:22.260]   they used to do this to us all the time.
[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:23.340]   They put us in the hot sand.
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:25.660]   I remember someone telling me from Iraq,
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:27.820]   they said, if we were sick,
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:30.140]   they would put us into the hot sand to heat us up.
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:31.740]   And then you talk to somebody, you know,
[02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:33.700]   from the 1950s, grandma would say,
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:35.500]   oh, they put us to bed and make sure
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:37.060]   we're all warm with the covers and.
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:38.020]   Hot water bottle.
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:39.340]   Hot water bottle, exactly.
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:41.660]   I mean, in Asia, they would do something different.
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:43.400]   I've heard them tell it.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.660]   It's interesting to me how all of these cultures
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:48.700]   that really haven't connected necessarily
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:50.620]   have come up with the same answers
[02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:52.080]   for a lot of these things.
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:57.940]   That said, there are things that purportedly
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.820]   we can take to accelerate our progression
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:03.940]   through an illness should we get one
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:05.460]   and to help avoid illness.
[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:07.540]   One of the things I'm most interested in
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:11.340]   is your thoughts on MAC, N-acetylcysteine.
[02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:13.980]   My understanding is that a few years ago in this country,
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:17.020]   there was an FDA ban on N-acetylcysteine,
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:18.900]   but that the people who had already been taking
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:20.980]   N-acetylcysteine were so bullish about it
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:24.060]   that they fought back and it has remained freely available
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:25.460]   without a prescription.
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:27.960]   My understanding is that N-acetylcysteine
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:30.380]   requires a prescription in some countries.
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:32.940]   Could you tell us what the various uses
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:37.860]   of N-acetylcysteine are and what its potential role is
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.260]   for avoiding or even accelerating the progression
[02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:43.860]   through a viral or other type of infection?
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:47.820]   - Yeah, so I sometimes say N-acetylcysteine.
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:50.180]   It may be just my Canadian accent coming through.
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:52.640]   - I'm guessing, oh, I didn't realize you were Canadian.
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:54.740]   I'm guessing you are correct and I'm incorrect.
[02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:55.740]   - No, I think you are correct
[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:56.820]   'cause people have corrected me.
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:59.860]   So I think if I say it, if slip up, that's what happens.
[02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:02.780]   - Mom, mom, you know, ninth grade and grade nine,
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:03.780]   these are all Canadian.
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:04.620]   - That is true.
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:05.700]   - Yeah, so.
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:08.300]   - So probably the most obvious one to start with
[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:10.420]   is the one that's actually we use all the time
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:13.340]   in the hospital and it's for Tylenol overdose.
[02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:16.820]   And that's because Tylenol, the metabolism of Tylenol
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:19.820]   depletes the liver of these reducing agents,
[02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:21.300]   glutathione, things of that nature.
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:25.300]   So N-acetylcysteine is going to replace that.
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:27.780]   And that's one of the things that's well-known.
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:29.180]   We actually have dosing protocols.
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:31.820]   We have nomograms to tell us when we should use it,
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:32.700]   when we shouldn't use it.
[02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:34.460]   And it's very well-documented.
[02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:36.420]   - So it supports the liver metabolism.
[02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:37.660]   - It supports liver metabolism
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:40.220]   and prevents the liver from going into failure.
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:42.260]   So people could literally die
[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:44.140]   if we didn't give them this medication.
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:46.740]   - Does it also effectively treat liver failure
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:48.260]   due to other things like alcohol?
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:50.380]   - That's an excellent question.
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.020]   I would say if you asked me that question
[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:54.060]   20 to 25 years ago, I would have said no,
[02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:54.900]   there's no evidence.
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:57.500]   But now if you talk to some GI specialists,
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.100]   they'll say, yeah, there's some data
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:01.280]   that it actually may be beneficial.
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:02.660]   It's certainly not gonna hurt.
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:05.220]   And so in patients who have liver failure
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:06.220]   from one thing or another,
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:09.140]   they may actually recommend using that medication as well,
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:09.980]   N-acetylcysteine.
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.140]   - So NAC is a glutathione precursor.
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:12.980]   Is that right?
[02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:14.180]   - It is one that it's recharging.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:17.500]   So if you wanna think about it in terms of redox,
[02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:19.180]   this is a good way to think about it,
[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:22.660]   is think about a sulfur element
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:26.860]   with a hydrogen attached to it.
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:29.640]   That is the reduced form
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:32.580]   because it can donate that proton often
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:34.580]   and it'll be in a reduced situation.
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:37.640]   So it can reduce something that was oxidized.
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:40.060]   However, when it reduces something that was oxidized
[02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:42.060]   and it does that in a good way,
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:43.620]   it itself becomes oxidized.
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:48.340]   And instead of having an S-H, it's now S-S.
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:50.420]   So now it's oxidized.
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:53.960]   That's really important in a lot of places
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:55.700]   because of that S-S bond.
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:00.700]   So you'll know that the S-S bonds occurs in amino acids.
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:03.540]   It's the reason why you can perm your hair.
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:04.380]   You may not know that,
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:08.300]   but the way your hair is is because of S-S bonds.
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:11.120]   And then what you do is you reduce all of those S-S bonds.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.340]   In other words, basically disconnecting them.
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:16.740]   And then you can curl it however you want.
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:18.460]   And then when you take it away,
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:21.740]   those S-S bonds clamp down and you have a perm.
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:22.660]   - All right, next episode,
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:24.820]   I'll show up looking like a Chia pet.
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:26.740]   - That's the reason why when you go to get a perm,
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:28.820]   that stuff smells like rotten eggs.
[02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:31.060]   It's because that's the sulfur group, yeah.
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:35.620]   So that's also, by the way, the same reason why,
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:37.820]   and this gets into a little bit other discussion
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:40.980]   about why I think NAC may be, I'll just call it NAC,
[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:42.700]   is used in other areas,
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:45.340]   is this is also the main reason
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:48.900]   why we get thrombosis of platelets.
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:51.340]   So pulmonary artery,
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:54.540]   if you have the endothelial lining,
[02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:56.380]   which makes sure that the red blood cells
[02:13:56.380 --> 02:13:58.260]   as they're going through the pulmonary artery
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:00.860]   are not causing clots.
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:04.420]   If that endothelial lining would become damaged,
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:05.980]   it would release underneath it
[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:09.020]   and expose a huge collection
[02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:11.940]   of something called von Willebrand's factor.
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:13.700]   Von Willebrand's factor is a monomer,
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:15.660]   but it quickly becomes a polymer.
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:19.940]   And the way it does that is in forming SS bonds.
[02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:21.500]   So that's a quick polymerization.
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.940]   Then of course, the next step that happens
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:26.340]   is that these polymers will then trap platelets
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:28.020]   and cause them to clump,
[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:30.500]   and you will get something called a white clot.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:31.940]   - So for those that aren't familiar
[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:34.420]   with monomers and polymers and this kind of thing,
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:36.300]   basically you're taking a bead
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.820]   and you're creating the polymer,
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:39.340]   which is more like beads on a string.
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:40.500]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:41.740]   - And that can capture more things,
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:42.940]   like a big clumpy molecule.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:47.060]   Big clumpy, sticky molecules aren't "bad" or "good,"
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:48.660]   but in this context, they're definitely bad.
[02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:49.500]   - They would be, yeah.
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:51.540]   So imagine now, if you will,
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:54.420]   the pulmonary artery in somebody who becomes infected
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.460]   with either influenza or COVID-19,
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:15:02.100]   and that causes an oxidative stress situation
[02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:06.180]   where you have the cell having more oxidative stress
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:09.100]   than it should, causes dysfunction of the cell,
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:12.500]   the cell becomes damaged, heals back,
[02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:14.460]   releases some of the von Willebrand's factor,
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:17.340]   and now you have clots in the pulmonary artery.
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:19.660]   This is something actually that we did see with COVID.
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:20.980]   When they did the autopsies,
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:25.980]   they found many times more of these specific white clots
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:28.460]   in these patients.
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:31.580]   And so I don't know if that's the mechanism
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:32.980]   that's occurring in influenza,
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:35.980]   but there was a lot of papers that were published in COVID.
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:38.700]   And the interesting thing about that was,
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:40.740]   is that, do you remember when they published,
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:42.220]   they had a paper that was published
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:44.820]   looking at blood types and COVID,
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:46.020]   and they said, "You know what?
[02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:48.660]   "What we're finding is is that those with type O blood
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:52.180]   "are just slightly less susceptible to getting COVID.
[02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:54.540]   "They have a slightly less mortality."
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:56.780]   - Yeah, that was a relief to me because I'm O blood.
[02:15:56.780 --> 02:15:57.860]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:00.120]   - Well, the interesting thing about that is well-known,
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:01.500]   is that people with type O blood
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:04.580]   have slightly less von Willebrand's factor.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:09.200]   - So does that mean in general that we clot less?
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:10.740]   - If that clotting is related
[02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:12.980]   to von Willebrand's factor in platelets, then yes.
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:17.140]   There's other ways of causing clotting cascade, but yes.
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:18.280]   So I found it really interesting.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.180]   There was kind of two independent points
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:22.340]   that sort of connected each other.
[02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.060]   The other thing that was actually really interesting
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:25.620]   about this, and this will lead to the conversation
[02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:28.620]   about NAC and why I was using it in actually patients
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:30.340]   with COVID-19 and influenza,
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:33.020]   and we'll talk about that study too,
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:35.820]   is ACE2.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:38.140]   So ACE2 is the receptor for the spike protein
[02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:40.540]   for SARS-CoV-2, true.
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:42.800]   But let's take it one step further.
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:45.060]   That ACE2, what is it actually there for?
[02:16:45.060 --> 02:16:45.900]   Why is it even there?
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:49.000]   It's not there to be a receptor for spike protein.
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000]   The actual job that ACE2 does is it converts angiotensin-2,
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.100]   which is a pro-oxidant, into angiotensin-1,7,
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:58.340]   which is an antioxidant.
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:01.660]   So let's go back to the beginning of our discussion again.
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:03.020]   Here's the mitochondria.
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:05.620]   Here is the mitochondria is doing what it needs to do,
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.780]   and it's producing oxidative stress.
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:09.340]   And it's got all these different enzymes
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:13.620]   that are there to lessen the heat from that engine,
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:17.460]   catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase,
[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:19.800]   melatonin, as we discussed at the beginning,
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:22.280]   and angiotensin-1,7.
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.040]   So now what happens?
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:27.420]   You've got these patients that have obesity.
[02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:29.920]   You have these patients that have cancer.
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:32.980]   Heart disease, dementia.
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:35.700]   These are people whose engines are running hot.
[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:37.340]   They're barely making it
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:39.340]   because of all of the oxidative stress damage
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.180]   that has occurred.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.000]   Now what happens?
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.600]   This virus comes in, spike protein, hits the ACE2 receptor,
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:47.760]   and now that thing that was in balance
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:48.740]   is now out of balance
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:51.180]   because you're no longer taking a pro-oxidant
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:52.920]   and making an antioxidant.
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:56.420]   So now the analogy is that you're in a car,
[02:17:56.420 --> 02:17:59.780]   and the heat in the engine's barely,
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:01.140]   I mean, it's coming up, right?
[02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:02.060]   And you're barely making it,
[02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:05.100]   and now you approach a hill called COVID-19,
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:06.080]   and you're going up that hill.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:07.340]   You're gonna burn out.
[02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:08.900]   Your engine's gonna overheat.
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:10.740]   And that's what was happening with these patients.
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.980]   Remember they were coming in happy hypoxics,
[02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:14.180]   they were calling them?
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:15.420]   They were there, they looked, they were fine,
[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:19.100]   but they were severely hypoxic.
[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:20.420]   What I believe what was happening,
[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:22.940]   and there's some data to show this is the case,
[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:26.380]   is that as the virus went into the lungs,
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:28.780]   and I believe this also happens with influenza,
[02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:33.220]   the virus was getting into the pulmonary circulation.
[02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:34.380]   And as it was going down,
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:37.500]   it was binding to the very rich ACE2 receptors
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:39.940]   and all of these pulmonary endothelial cells.
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:43.220]   And it was causing these enzymes to stop working,
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:45.960]   and now the oxidative balance was being knocked out.
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:48.580]   These cells were becoming damaged, they were peeling off.
[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:51.220]   Von Willebrand's factor was coming into circulation,
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:53.540]   and this polymerization was occurring,
[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:54.820]   and these white clots were occurring,
[02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:56.980]   and that was leading to hypoxemia.
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:18:58.980]   How do we stop that from happening?
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:00.780]   Well, certainly one way of doing it
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:02.980]   is to make sure that the redox balance
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:05.740]   in these cells are maintained.
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:08.420]   And one way of doing that is light and melatonin
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.220]   and all the things that we just talked about.
[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:12.860]   But another way of doing it, in addition,
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:15.060]   would potentially be in preventing those sulfide bonds
[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:18.580]   from forming and causing polymerization.
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:20.100]   And that's where you have NAC,
[02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:23.920]   which is basically, it would go through to those SS bonds
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:27.500]   that are causing the polymerization and break them off.
[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:28.420]   - I see.
[02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:32.100]   So I started taking NAC at, I think it's 600 milligrams
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:35.260]   or even 900 milligrams three to four times per day,
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:36.720]   which is a very high dose,
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:39.140]   but restricted to times when I felt like
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:41.540]   I might be coming down with an infection
[02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:45.900]   or I was traveling in the winter months, I still do this,
[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:50.660]   or if I had any kind of low-level congestion.
[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:53.860]   And my understanding is that it's a mucolytic.
[02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:55.960]   - Yes, because mucus, again,
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:57.780]   the reason why mucus is so thick
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:19:59.900]   is because of those SS bonds.
[02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:01.900]   So when you put NAC in there,
[02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:04.700]   it breaks it off and now it's liquidy.
[02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:06.900]   - It's used to treat cystic fibrosis
[02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:10.700]   and to counteract the buildup of fluid in the lungs,
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:11.660]   as I understand.
[02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:12.700]   - Yeah.
[02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:15.700]   - So it will make your nose run a bit
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:17.160]   if you have a little low-level congestion.
[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:19.940]   But what I love about it, and I don't have any really,
[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:20.780]   to be clear, folks,
[02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:23.580]   I don't have any relationship to any company that sells NAC.
[02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:27.700]   I'm not paid by the big NAC or anything similar,
[02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:29.340]   - Or Big Mac.
[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:32.240]   - Certainly not by Big Mac, but by Big Mac either.
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:36.940]   But I don't like conventional decongestants.
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:39.700]   I like steam, but I don't like taking over
[02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:40.780]   the counter decongestants
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:44.260]   of the sort of conventional commercial type
[02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:46.260]   because they tend to be very drying.
[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:47.320]   They sometimes have a little bit
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:48.700]   of a stimulant quality to them.
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:50.020]   I just don't like them.
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:53.820]   And I find that NAC, in addition to increasing glutathione,
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:55.380]   which can only be a good thing,
[02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:58.620]   is a great decongestant.
[02:20:58.620 --> 02:21:00.420]   You do have to keep blowing your nose quite a lot.
[02:21:00.420 --> 02:21:01.620]   If you take it right before you go to sleep
[02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:02.940]   and you sleep on your back,
[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:04.900]   you can wake up like feeling more congested.
[02:21:04.900 --> 02:21:07.140]   So you have to kind of understand what it's doing.
[02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:08.940]   That's why we're talking about it in this way.
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:13.220]   But I find that it's helped me move through periods
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:17.860]   of sort of exposure to colds, maybe flus,
[02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:19.820]   but certainly colds, much faster.
[02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:21.220]   And actually there are data to support
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:23.700]   that it can prevent contracting the flu virus.
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:26.180]   - Well, not necessarily contracting it,
[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.700]   but certainly having the symptoms of it.
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:30.100]   So this was a, this is like the best study
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:31.220]   you could ever imagine, right?
[02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:34.260]   So this is a multi-centered, double-blinded,
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:36.060]   placebo-controlled trial, right?
[02:21:36.060 --> 02:21:38.320]   So you're eliminating a lot of the confounders.
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:40.780]   And what they did was in a winter season,
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:43.340]   so I think it was over three to six months,
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:47.460]   people were taking 600 milligrams of NAC twice a day.
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:49.140]   And what they did was they looked to see
[02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:52.020]   how many people got infected and what their symptoms were.
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:55.540]   And while it did not reduce the number of infections
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:59.300]   from influenza, there was a significant reduction
[02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:02.300]   in the symptoms of influenza.
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:04.160]   So infections, no, it doesn't reduce,
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.180]   but symptoms dramatically.
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:07.160]   And which symptoms specifically?
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:08.620]   It's the most annoying symptoms.
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:11.580]   So the one that dropped the most was the runny nose
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:12.980]   and the sore throat.
[02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:15.740]   That was what it was best at reducing.
[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:17.780]   There's been some question about NAC
[02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:20.540]   because it's so good for cells, right?
[02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:22.840]   'Cause it replenishes.
[02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:26.000]   There are some studies in vitro in cells
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:31.000]   that are designed to be models for cancer
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.760]   that NAC can actually cause the propensity
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:39.760]   for some of these cells to grow and expand.
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:41.600]   I think that probably needs to be taken
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:42.960]   with a little bit of grain of salt
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:46.240]   because these were in models that are designed
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:47.440]   for cancer cells to grow.
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:50.840]   So the same thing would happen if you were to give nutrition
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:52.800]   to cancer cells on a Petri dish, right?
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:53.680]   That doesn't necessarily mean
[02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:55.760]   that nutrition causes cancer.
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.960]   - Yeah, you raise a really important point around this.
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:23:01.280]   I mean, the joke that was told to me years ago
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:05.000]   is a drug or a compound is a substance
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.440]   that when injected into an animal
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:09.800]   creates a scientific paper.
[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:13.040]   Meaning it's very easy to see things change
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.280]   when you add, when you do a dose response curve
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:17.360]   of just about anything.
[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:19.480]   And some people might say, well, thank goodness,
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:22.040]   are any compounds doing anything that's real
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:23.000]   or is it all placebo?
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.600]   I think there are real effects of compounds.
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:27.760]   The context is really important.
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:31.520]   Do you take NAC continuously given your job
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:33.920]   or do you increase your dosage
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:37.600]   when you know you're coming into contact with flu patients?
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:40.520]   - I do exactly as this paper was doing.
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:42.240]   In a winter season when I know
[02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:44.600]   that things are gonna be elevated and high
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:47.680]   and I'm gonna be seeing a lot of influenza patients,
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:50.080]   I do take 600 milligrams twice a day.
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:51.880]   But I try not to do it for more than three months.
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:53.240]   I don't know the long-term effects,
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:55.200]   but I think three months is probably good enough.
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:56.680]   - Yeah, I know people take it continuously.
[02:23:56.680 --> 02:23:58.160]   I've never taken it continuously.
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:02.440]   I sort of enjoy the fact that there are certain compounds
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:07.120]   out there like NAC that I personally can observe a benefit
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:08.760]   from if I take it for short periods
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:12.480]   and slightly higher doses, and then I stop.
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:15.680]   And I have the, you know, an unfounded theory
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.120]   that it helps punctuate the effectiveness
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:22.640]   because there is down regulation
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:25.440]   of pretty much every mechanism you could possibly imagine.
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:27.120]   - Yeah, I mean, there's so many redundancies
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:28.640]   that are built into the system.
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:32.520]   But in this situation, I don't know what the mechanism is,
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:34.200]   but I believe that with influenza,
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:39.160]   there is a tilting of the scale toward oxidative stress.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:41.840]   And NAC in that sense can be very helpful.
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:44.660]   - And as I recall in the study that you described
[02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:48.220]   where people took this 600 milligrams of NAC twice a day,
[02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:52.700]   the reduction in severe symptoms,
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:54.180]   or was it the number of people
[02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:56.740]   that experienced severe symptoms went from somewhere
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:00.740]   in the high 70%, maybe 78% or something like that.
[02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:04.540]   I'm not quite exact on the numbers here, folks,
[02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:06.820]   to about 28%, is that right?
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:11.820]   - Yeah, so that's about a 50% absolute risk reduction,
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.100]   which if you do the math,
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:15.260]   it's a number needed to treat of two,
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:18.460]   which is extremely low and very amazing.
[02:25:18.460 --> 02:25:22.960]   - And you're getting an increase in glutathione to boot.
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:25.300]   - Yeah, yeah. - So, yeah, wonderful.
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:29.420]   Other things that have been shown to improve symptomology
[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:32.860]   or perhaps even immune system function,
[02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:34.580]   maybe we could talk about zinc.
[02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:35.420]   - Yeah.
[02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:37.420]   - I take what most people would consider
[02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:38.660]   very high levels of zinc,
[02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:40.100]   and I've been doing it for a long time,
[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.020]   and I'm gonna continue to do it,
[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:44.300]   'cause I do my blood work and it works for me.
[02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:46.620]   I think there is actually good data for zinc.
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:48.620]   Some people might disagree,
[02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:51.500]   but I think the studies that I've seen
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:55.620]   seem to show that zinc supplementation can be beneficial.
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:57.100]   The theoretical, of course,
[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:58.380]   and I'm sure you're familiar with it,
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:25:59.700]   is the copper deficiency,
[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:02.220]   and if you're checking that, then that's fine.
[02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:04.260]   The recommendations that I have seen
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:06.660]   is 40 milligrams of elemental zinc.
[02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:08.740]   So you have to be careful when you look up zinc
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:10.940]   on your bottles to tell you how many milligrams,
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:13.000]   but it's the entire molecule that they're measuring,
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.380]   so you've gotta, it'll also say how many milligrams
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:19.260]   of elemental zinc that is equivalent to,
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:21.620]   and the recommendation that I've heard from people
[02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:24.540]   is 40 milligrams, but I don't,
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:26.020]   if you're checking your copper levels,
[02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:26.940]   then you should be fine, yeah.
[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:29.420]   - Well, it's never charted out by body weight either,
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:31.540]   so I weigh, you know, 215 pounds,
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:34.240]   so what's the risk of copper depletion?
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:39.100]   - Blood deficiencies and things of that nature, yeah.
[02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:41.460]   - Okay, I'll get my copper levels checked.
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:44.520]   - I believe it's in my blood panel.
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.240]   It is in my blood panel, and I don't have a flag there,
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:48.400]   but I'll keep an eye on it.
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:49.460]   - Yeah, liver, I believe,
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:52.120]   also is involved with copper as well.
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:56.080]   - So what is zinc doing to improve immune system function?
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:59.200]   - There's a couple of enzymes that use zinc as a cofactor,
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.480]   and I believe that that's what it's related to.
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:05.320]   I can't remember exactly which ones they are,
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:07.440]   but zinc is used as a cofactor
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:11.320]   in some of the enzymatic reactions of the immune system, yeah.
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.300]   - Why doesn't somebody market an interferon inhaler
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:16.420]   or a nasal spray?
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:19.420]   - You know, actually, they are looking at that.
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:24.420]   When I was researching this for the intravenous interferon,
[02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:28.060]   I remember seeing something about interferon
[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:29.340]   in terms of a nasal spray.
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.060]   I haven't seen that yet, though.
[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:35.380]   - Someone out there who's industrious can create one.
[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:37.460]   - It doesn't make you feel very nice.
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:40.500]   I mean, when these patients, for instance,
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:43.380]   well, this might be material to understand, too.
[02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:46.700]   For many years, we had hepatitis C that was incurable,
[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:49.580]   and interferon actually is the cure.
[02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:52.580]   There was a point where we used to give infusions
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:55.040]   of interferon to cure people with hepatitis C,
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.860]   but when we gave them the treatment, they felt horrible,
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:00.180]   felt like they had the flu, and it's for good reasons,
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:03.540]   because when you have high levels of interferon,
[02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:05.300]   you do have the flu, it feels like that.
[02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:06.500]   - It's worth touching on this,
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:11.780]   so much of the symptomology when we have a flu or a cold
[02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:15.140]   or what have you is the immune system doing its thing,
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:20.140]   the fever, the congestion, and we think of that
[02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:23.100]   as the illness, but it's often the byproduct
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:25.660]   of the body trying to extrude or kill.
[02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:28.380]   - Exactly, nobody likes congestion,
[02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:30.580]   so I don't mind treating that,
[02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:32.500]   but I think out of all of those symptoms
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:35.540]   that you mentioned there, the one that I think
[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:38.500]   is probably the most beneficial to keep is the fever.
[02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:44.180]   - What about these cocktails that I see,
[02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:47.220]   eucalyptus oil, oregano oil, all this stuff,
[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:49.100]   is it completely worthless?
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.540]   - No, it's not completely worthless.
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:53.380]   So let's talk about the science,
[02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:56.060]   let's talk about the actual data.
[02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:58.140]   We don't have, I don't have a randomized control trial
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:28:59.660]   to give you like I did with light,
[02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:02.060]   but there was a study that was done,
[02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:03.620]   and the reason why they were looking at this,
[02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:05.700]   this was a bunch of oncologists that were looking
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:08.100]   to see if there was something that could improve
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:11.140]   the immune system when people were getting chemotherapy,
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:13.800]   and they did an in vitro study, so this is in vitro,
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:16.660]   but they were able to show that just a very small amount
[02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:19.740]   of eucalyptus oil had a tremendous impact
[02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:23.700]   on phagocytosis on the innate immune system.
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:25.180]   They actually-- - Phagocytosis, folks,
[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:27.460]   sorry for interrupting, but is it a gobbling up
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:30.220]   of bad stuff by good cells?
[02:29:30.220 --> 02:29:31.220]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:35.100]   So they had these beads, and the paper showed
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.100]   that these beads, and they were fluorescent,
[02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:39.140]   and you could see in the cells
[02:29:39.140 --> 02:29:42.220]   that had not yet gotten the eucalyptus oil
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:43.820]   that there was a number of beads outside,
[02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:46.140]   and these cells were just kind of moseying around,
[02:29:46.140 --> 02:29:49.660]   and they had both light microscopy and electron microscopy,
[02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:53.620]   and a few of these beads had gotten eaten up inside,
[02:29:53.620 --> 02:29:56.140]   and then they showed the next slide.
[02:29:56.140 --> 02:29:58.180]   It was like a transformation with the eucalyptus oil,
[02:29:58.180 --> 02:30:01.060]   so instead of these nice rounded cells,
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:03.780]   they were like all of these things just coming out,
[02:30:03.780 --> 02:30:06.340]   like little podocytes, like reaching for things,
[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:09.740]   and then a few hours later, it showed all of the beads
[02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:12.100]   that were outside were now inside.
[02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:15.020]   So there was something in the eucalyptus oil itself
[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:18.520]   that was stimulating the innate immune system
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:20.540]   to gobble this stuff up.
[02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:24.500]   And again, we go back to the folksy type of old stuff.
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:29.300]   The main ingredient in Vicks VapoRub is eucalyptus oil.
[02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:34.300]   - Could I have a theory that it's not going to be
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:37.860]   very kind to eucalyptus trees or koalas
[02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:39.620]   or anything related to eucalyptus,
[02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:44.620]   which is that maybe the eucalyptus oil is a mild irritant
[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:47.020]   at the cellular level.
[02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:52.020]   You inhale it, you get this menthol-like odorant.
[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:55.900]   It's kind of caustic, and the immune system reacts to it
[02:30:55.900 --> 02:30:59.100]   by activating phagocytes to go gobble up more stuff.
[02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:00.260]   - It could very well be.
[02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:04.980]   In that line of discussion, it's very imperative
[02:31:04.980 --> 02:31:08.160]   to understand that eucalyptus oil is never recommended
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:10.540]   to be taken internally.
[02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:12.420]   There's actually been reported deaths
[02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:14.180]   from taking too much eucalyptus oil.
[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:16.400]   So I just put that out there, that if people think
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:18.860]   that it's gonna work and more is better.
[02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:21.920]   Usually the way it's used and the way it has been used,
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:25.560]   historically, is, and for instance, in hydrotherapy,
[02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:28.580]   they would put maybe a few drops of that
[02:31:28.580 --> 02:31:30.940]   or rub it onto the skin and allow it to sink.
[02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:32.340]   And it's extremely potent.
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:36.780]   If you go online to buy eucalyptus essential oil,
[02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:38.540]   that should not really be taken internally.
[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:40.300]   It's not designed for that.
[02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:44.140]   It's extremely potent, and putting it maybe on your,
[02:31:44.140 --> 02:31:46.140]   sometimes I'll do that, put it on the upper lip,
[02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:47.660]   so I'm inhaling it.
[02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:50.580]   It actually can be actually very soothing.
[02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:53.060]   In fact, one of the things that I found very soothing,
[02:31:53.060 --> 02:31:55.620]   and there are actually some data in the literature on this,
[02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:58.100]   is if you get a cold and you're congested,
[02:31:58.100 --> 02:32:01.380]   it's just heating up some hot water on the stove,
[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:04.180]   putting a towel over your head and just inhaling that steam.
[02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:08.460]   It tends to open things up and decrease the congestion.
[02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:10.180]   And I've been known to put a couple of drops
[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:11.700]   of eucalyptus oil into that,
[02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.560]   and that's actually been beneficial as well.
[02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:17.100]   - Great, don't ingest eucalyptus oil, folks.
[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:19.460]   I'll take it as a personal insult,
[02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:22.640]   but I'm not gonna take responsibility if you do it anyway.
[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:24.720]   That's a great segue to error.
[02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:29.660]   I've heard conflicting things vis-a-vis,
[02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:33.500]   should we sleep with an air humidifier?
[02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:37.540]   Should we sleep with a cold room under warm blankets?
[02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:40.420]   Lowering core body temperature
[02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:41.920]   definitely helps us fall asleep,
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:43.280]   but that's under conditions
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:45.580]   where we're not combating an illness.
[02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:48.120]   I have had the experience several times now,
[02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:50.220]   to the extent that I really believe it's a real effect,
[02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:52.820]   where if a room is extremely cold,
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:54.600]   even if I'm under warm blankets,
[02:32:54.600 --> 02:32:56.260]   breathing that cold air at night,
[02:32:56.260 --> 02:32:59.580]   I'll often get some respiratory stuff going on,
[02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:02.340]   probably 'cause of a drying out of the respiratory pathways.
[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.280]   - Yeah, that's very possible.
[02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:09.460]   So let's talk about air, 30,000 foot level.
[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:11.600]   First of all, don't inhale anything
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:14.500]   that's not either a medicine designed for your lungs
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:15.680]   or air itself.
[02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:18.480]   So it goes without saying, but smoking,
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:21.980]   cigar smoking, vaping. - Vaping, sorry folks.
[02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:23.620]   Vaping might be better for you than smoking,
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:25.760]   but it's still terrible for your lungs.
[02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:27.740]   That vaping community hates me
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:29.980]   because they want me to say it's not carcinogenic,
[02:33:29.980 --> 02:33:33.860]   but the data show that it can cause popcorn lung.
[02:33:33.860 --> 02:33:35.500]   I mean, it's just not good.
[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:37.940]   - No, right before COVID hit,
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:40.420]   I can't tell you how many young kids
[02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:42.940]   were being admitted to my ICU on ventilators.
[02:33:42.940 --> 02:33:45.020]   It was a little different at that time
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:46.300]   because it was so expansive
[02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:48.520]   that people were making vitamin E oil
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:49.980]   to cut the nicotine in,
[02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:52.860]   and they were making basically garage,
[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:55.500]   out of their garage brand vapes and selling it.
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:58.820]   And these kids were ending up in the ICU.
[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:00.580]   - This is totally unrelated to COVID.
[02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:02.620]   - This is totally unrelated to COVID.
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:06.840]   And to be fair, totally unrelated to the brand of vaping,
[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:07.820]   the brand names.
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.180]   So this was off-label stuff,
[02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:10.820]   people making their own thing and selling it.
[02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:11.980]   It was crazy.
[02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:15.340]   But let's talk about briefly the brand.
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:17.260]   So yeah, we're starting to understand now
[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:21.020]   that vaping doesn't have as many toxins that smoking does,
[02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:24.540]   but it's not a healthy choice.
[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:26.980]   And it contradicts us to the thought process
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:31.460]   is that it really doesn't get people off of nicotine.
[02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:34.220]   In fact, there's higher concentrations of nicotine
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:37.740]   in the vape than in regular cigarettes,
[02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:39.380]   very high concentrations.
[02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:42.100]   - Incidentally, what are your thoughts on non-smoked,
[02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:45.340]   non-vaped, non-dipped, non-snuffed nicotine?
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:48.300]   - So nicotine gum, nicotine pouches,
[02:34:48.300 --> 02:34:51.220]   I mean, will raise blood pressure, vasoconstrictor,
[02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:53.180]   but definitely increases alertness
[02:34:53.180 --> 02:34:55.960]   while causing relaxation, outcome clean.
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:58.500]   I occasionally will take a milligram or two,
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:01.860]   which is very low, of nicotine gum.
[02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:05.540]   Yeah, but never smoke or vape or dip or snuff it.
[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:07.460]   - I use it all the time in my patients
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:08.920]   who I'm trying to get off of smoking.
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:11.340]   So, and that's a safer alternative,
[02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:12.860]   especially for the lungs, right?
[02:35:12.860 --> 02:35:15.100]   'Cause this is not, they're not irritants
[02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:16.020]   that are going into the lungs.
[02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:17.540]   So no problem with that,
[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:20.500]   especially if it's used to get them off of smoking.
[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:22.300]   It's something that we use all the time.
[02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:23.500]   - Do you use nicotine?
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:24.320]   - No.
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:25.160]   - No. - Yeah.
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:27.780]   - There's a massive expansion in the number of people
[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:29.860]   taking nicotine pouches now.
[02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:32.080]   - Yeah, and it's something that affects the brain,
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:36.460]   as you know, it affects the pregnant women,
[02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:39.660]   affects a number of aspects of the nervous system.
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:42.820]   We have receptors called nicotinic receptors for a reason,
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:44.580]   because that's the neurotransmitter.
[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:46.860]   So yeah, it has an effect.
[02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:50.960]   - It is highly habit-forming/addictive.
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:56.180]   It does seem that at least in people 60 and older,
[02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:59.020]   there may be some mild cognitive sparing
[02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:00.860]   or enhancement due to nicotine use.
[02:36:00.860 --> 02:36:03.460]   I think that's an area that needs further exploration.
[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:05.540]   - Yeah, I'm not familiar with that data,
[02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.380]   but certainly something to look into.
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:09.180]   - Yeah, I'm not gonna try and convince you
[02:36:09.180 --> 02:36:10.340]   to get on nicotine.
[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:12.460]   I'll also say that it doesn't just hit
[02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:13.540]   the nicotinic receptors,
[02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:16.700]   it'll also hit the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
[02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:19.820]   And that's one reason why if you do take nicotine gum
[02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:21.260]   or use nicotine gums or pouches,
[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:22.820]   what you'll notice is when you don't use it,
[02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:26.260]   you'll feel as if your throat is mildly irritated
[02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:29.180]   and then you take it and it relaxes it.
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:30.020]   - Interesting.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:32.620]   - And this is one of the more subtle,
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:36.100]   but powerful ways in which it is habit-forming,
[02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:38.380]   is that people feel like they're more verbally fluid,
[02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:40.740]   they can breathe easier when they're taking nicotine,
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:41.980]   but it's a vasoconstrictor.
[02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:45.020]   So for those interested in performance-enhancing effects,
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:48.220]   it's pushing you in the opposite direction.
[02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:49.060]   Anyway.
[02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:49.880]   - So in terms of air,
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:52.420]   we've talked about what should not be in the air,
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:55.060]   but there's actually some data that's really surprising
[02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:58.460]   that I found during the pandemic that was interesting to me
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:00.740]   that should be in there that maybe isn't in there.
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:03.880]   And that's the fresh air associated with going outside.
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:05.780]   So what is out there in the air?
[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:07.100]   What should be out there?
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:08.580]   Obviously clean air.
[02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:11.380]   People who live next to freeways and pollution,
[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:12.200]   those are bad things.
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:13.720]   We've talked about that.
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.420]   But the Japanese seem to have a corner on this research.
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:19.340]   It's really interesting stuff.
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:21.220]   You've heard of forest bathing.
[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:22.740]   So there was a number of studies
[02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:25.800]   where they've taken these CEOs in Tokyo
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.380]   and they took them up to the Hinoki Cypress forests.
[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:30.220]   - Sounds beautiful.
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:31.040]   - It is.
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:32.860]   And what they found was,
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:34.820]   they did actually very controlled research
[02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:36.460]   where they checked blood levels
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:38.460]   and they did blood tests
[02:37:38.460 --> 02:37:40.780]   and they had them walk around for three days
[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:43.420]   in the forest, forest bathing.
[02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:45.100]   And they actually took air samples
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:47.340]   and they found that there's these substances
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:51.460]   called phytoncides, which are given off by the trees,
[02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:53.760]   not just Hinoki Cypress trees,
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:54.940]   but just about any kind of tree.
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:59.660]   So fir trees, oak trees, all sorts of pine trees.
[02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:03.660]   And that these substances interact with our bodies
[02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:07.140]   and specifically again, the innate immune system.
[02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:09.380]   They were actually able to look at chromogranin A,
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:11.860]   which is a substance that's in some of these
[02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:14.680]   white blood cells that are, you know,
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:17.300]   fighting white blood cells that fight infections.
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:18.420]   And they were able to show
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:21.740]   that when they were in that environment,
[02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:24.420]   there were definite changes in the immune system
[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:25.660]   toward the positive.
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:28.960]   And that these changes lasted for seven days.
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:30.820]   So they did another aspect of the study.
[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:32.300]   So there was a multiple publications
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.940]   that this group in Japan did.
[02:38:33.940 --> 02:38:36.280]   They took these same guys and they took them down
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:40.820]   to a hotel in Tokyo, out of the Hinoki Cypress forests.
[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:43.660]   And they infused the same phytoncides
[02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:45.540]   from these Hinoki Cypress trees.
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:47.740]   They basically took the oil from these trees
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:50.140]   and infused it in the hotel room.
[02:38:50.140 --> 02:38:52.360]   And they found very similar results
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:53.720]   to what they were getting out there
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:55.140]   when they're walking in the forest.
[02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:57.580]   So that would seem to indicate that there was something
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:00.740]   that this was what was being made responsible.
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:02.940]   The one difference, which was interesting,
[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:05.140]   between when they were up there walking around
[02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:07.460]   in the forest and when they were down in Tokyo
[02:39:07.460 --> 02:39:09.140]   in the hotel room with the infuser,
[02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:13.160]   is the urinary cortisol levels were lower
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:14.980]   when they were walking in the forest
[02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:16.320]   than when they were in the hotel.
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:19.860]   And that's, as you know, a symbol of basically stress.
[02:39:19.860 --> 02:39:23.340]   So there is something that, there was a je ne sais quoi,
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:24.440]   I guess the French would say.
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:28.560]   There's something gestalt about walking in the forest
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:32.600]   that's different than just infusing the Hinoki Cypress.
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:34.180]   But I thought that was an interesting thing.
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:36.620]   And it kind of goes along again
[02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:38.420]   with what we were talking about at the beginning.
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:41.660]   When you're out there in nature, in the forestry,
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:44.700]   in the green, walking green spaces, we have this evidence.
[02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:47.640]   These leaves reflect a lot of infrared light,
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:48.800]   which we've already talked about.
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:51.880]   But there's also something else in the equation as well.
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:53.480]   And it kind of leads just a bigger picture
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:55.580]   and a bigger philosophy of life.
[02:39:55.580 --> 02:39:57.280]   And that's the reductionism of science.
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:59.720]   We always try to reduce something to an active ingredient
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:01.780]   to try to figure out what it is.
[02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:03.120]   But there is actually something to be said
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:06.120]   for getting these things in the environment
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:08.240]   that we would normally be getting them in.
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:09.700]   I think that's interesting.
[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:11.720]   - Someone made the comment recently
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:15.840]   that so much of modern health,
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.600]   or our attempts at being healthier in modern times,
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:21.100]   perhaps the better way to put it,
[02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:24.120]   is about trying to bring the out of doors indoors.
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:24.960]   - That's correct.
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:27.760]   We exercise in gyms, whereas we used to,
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:30.520]   carry buckets of fruit and soil.
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:35.080]   And we are talking about some artificial light.
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:36.980]   There's no replacement,
[02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:41.200]   but ways to supplement artificial light, excuse me,
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:43.920]   ways to supplement sunlight with artificial light.
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:45.960]   We're just indoors a lot more.
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:48.160]   And no one's suggesting that we all run around
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:50.880]   in loincloths outside all the time.
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:55.460]   But there really does seem to be many factors
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:57.500]   within outdoor environments.
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:00.380]   So many, both known and unknown,
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:02.960]   seems that the reductionist approach to science,
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.140]   while I've made it my profession for many decades,
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:12.680]   it makes sense why no one thing seems to solve
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:16.000]   all the issues that we're after,
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.800]   that we need to experience these things in combination.
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:21.120]   Maybe nature is just the best way to do that.
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:23.640]   - Yeah, and I can't help but think of some studies
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:25.040]   that have been done in the past
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:27.300]   where this has really highlighted it.
[02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:28.760]   There was some evidence,
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:31.180]   they believed that people with lung cancer
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:33.000]   would do better if they had,
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.320]   'cause they noticed that people with lung cancer did better
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:37.960]   when they had diets that were rich in vitamin E
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:39.880]   and vitamin A derivatives.
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:41.200]   So they said, "Oh, reductionist science.
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:42.860]   "Let's go ahead and get vitamin E, vitamin A.
[02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:43.700]   "Let's package it.
[02:41:43.700 --> 02:41:44.620]   "Let's give them some high doses.
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:48.040]   "Maybe this will solve lung cancer or help lung cancer."
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:49.320]   They had to stop the study early
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:52.240]   because they did worse than the control subjects.
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:54.640]   - Important to point that out,
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:56.800]   that the high-dose supplementation is not the same
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:00.520]   as ingesting something in the context of a food.
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:03.640]   - And we didn't discuss it directly,
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:05.760]   but we kind of alluded to it with lights,
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:07.600]   and indoor light and artificial light.
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:09.280]   So what do we get?
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:12.560]   The human body, since its existence,
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:16.360]   has always had blue lights in the presence of red lights.
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:19.760]   And altogether, the entire biological spectrum.
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:23.240]   And now what we've done is we've essentially created
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:28.160]   an indoor environment where we have efficient lights,
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:29.760]   which are supposed to be,
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:32.360]   more efficient would imply that it's equivalent.
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:34.920]   But realize that LED lights,
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:36.800]   or the LED lights that are commercially available
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:39.640]   for us to buy, are energy efficient
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:43.520]   because they're not broadcasting, if you will,
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:45.440]   in the infrared or in the ultraviolet.
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:49.320]   It's a very specific, narrow range of visible light.
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:50.360]   We alluded to this.
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:53.080]   - Oftentimes there's no red light in there either.
[02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:53.920]   - Exactly.
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:56.680]   - They are really blue, green, yellow,
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:59.320]   sometimes even UV light.
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:00.160]   - Right.
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:02.080]   - I mean, the fluorescent lights in a department store,
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:04.720]   for instance, or in a pharmacy.
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:07.880]   I haven't done the spectral waveform analysis,
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:11.200]   but those who have, it's published, it's out there.
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.040]   There are a lot of data
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:15.040]   in environmental occupational health stuff,
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:19.600]   would show that the emission spectra
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:23.840]   are severely tilted toward short wavelengths.
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:25.200]   And there's hardly any red light in there.
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:26.640]   Whereas a candle, for instance,
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:28.520]   or a fire roaring, fire roaring candle,
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:29.600]   people ask that, sorry to interrupt,
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:31.960]   is almost all orange and red light.
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:32.800]   - Right.
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:33.640]   - And then people say,
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.000]   "Well, won't that wake me up at night?"
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:36.960]   And a lot of people are surprised to know this.
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:39.720]   I'll just ask you, and it's not a trick question,
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:43.320]   but how many lux do you think come from
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:48.320]   like a really bright candle or a roaring fireplace?
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:52.080]   Or the brightest moonlit night on a full moon?
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:53.320]   - Since you asked it that way,
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:55.080]   I'm gonna try to guess the other direction
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:56.200]   and say like 50.
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:00.840]   - So somewhere between one and 10 would be high level.
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:01.680]   - Okay, wow.
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:02.520]   - And then I started, and I was like,
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:04.440]   there's no way that could be, right?
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:05.280]   How could it be?
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:08.400]   It's like this roaring fireplace or the moon that lights up.
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:11.240]   So it turns out that if you're at a campfire
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:13.000]   and we're facing one another around the campfire,
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.640]   I can see your face across the campfire,
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:16.240]   I can see the front of your body.
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:19.940]   And so it looks like it's so bright, it must wake me up.
[02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:21.560]   But no, you have no trouble going back to your tent
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:23.220]   and falling asleep or your cabin.
[02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:27.200]   If you turn away from that bright campfire,
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:28.760]   you need a flashlight to navigate
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:30.220]   even the shortest distance,
[02:44:30.220 --> 02:44:32.440]   which tells you that it's not very bright at all.
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:34.400]   It's very concentrated,
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:36.560]   but the fall off of that brightness
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:40.880]   is really what indicates just how dim it really is.
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:43.960]   But if we think about an LED coming off a wall panel
[02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:45.940]   to adjust temperature in a hotel room,
[02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:50.560]   it has something like 100 to 400 lux.
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:53.320]   And yet we think of it as a dim nightlight.
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:56.580]   And so this is sneaky stuff.
[02:44:56.580 --> 02:45:00.880]   It's really diabolical because that wall nightlight
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:05.720]   or thermostat light messes up our glucose regulation
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:07.960]   as shown in really good peer reviewed studies.
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:08.800]   - Absolutely.
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:09.700]   And then the other aspect of it,
[02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:11.680]   and I actually, I think I learned this from you,
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:14.040]   is that the photoreceptors
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.000]   are in the lower portion of our retina.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.840]   Or sorry, the lower portion of our retina.
[02:45:18.840 --> 02:45:22.760]   And so the type of light
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:24.720]   that's gonna affect your circadian rhythm
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:26.480]   is gonna be much more likely to do that
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:27.720]   if it's coming from up above
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:30.040]   or at the same level than down below.
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:30.880]   - That's right.
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:34.280]   And the Scandinavians, my stepmom is Scandinavian,
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:35.960]   understood this intuitively.
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.640]   And so in the evening, they don't have a ceiling light.
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:40.520]   They turn off the ceiling lights
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:44.000]   and then they only use desk sort of table level
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.760]   or even floor lights.
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:48.920]   Now, candles along the floor would be the ultimate,
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:49.960]   but it's super dangerous.
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:51.400]   And we just had a bunch of fires here
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:54.120]   and those were outdoor fires at first anyway.
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:58.680]   And the reason we're riffing
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:03.360]   in a kind of light bio improv here
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:04.800]   is that when you step back
[02:46:04.800 --> 02:46:06.960]   and you just look at it logically,
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:09.520]   we have dim days, as you pointed out before,
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:11.800]   we have bright evenings and nights,
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:14.720]   and it's all short wavelength at night.
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:15.800]   It's terrible.
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:18.920]   I'm beginning to think that many, many, many
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:20.480]   of the problems that we have
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:22.760]   in terms of our metabolic health,
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:24.320]   sure that has to do with food,
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:26.400]   certainly has to do with lack of exercise
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:29.440]   and a number of things, screens, et cetera.
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:32.560]   But I'm convinced that the light piece
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:35.320]   is at least one of the top three,
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:37.280]   if not the top two major factors
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:39.760]   in determining the kind of obesity metabolic crisis.
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:41.240]   - I completely agree with you.
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:44.880]   The one thing I was gonna add to that too are the windows.
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:49.400]   So you're aware, of course, in California we have,
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:53.200]   we need efficiency and we have these windows
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:54.760]   called low E glass,
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:56.400]   and they're specifically designed
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:59.680]   to filter out infrared lights.
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:02.120]   So the way you can tell whether or not your window
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:04.840]   is filtering that out is just stand in it
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:06.080]   when the sun is on it.
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:10.280]   If there is a lot, if you can feel the warmth of that sun,
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:12.080]   then you know that it's one of the old windows
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:13.200]   that's allowing that to come in.
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:16.000]   If you don't feel it, that's a low E glass.
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.800]   And so what we've done is we've created
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:19.640]   this environment inside.
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:22.960]   We've gotten rid of the incandescent bulbs.
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:24.320]   We have LED bulbs.
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:26.120]   We've gotten rid of the regular window.
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:27.480]   It's all for energy efficiency,
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:28.800]   which is a reasonable thing to do.
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:30.600]   We need energy efficiency.
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.600]   But no one's asked what the human collateral damage is
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:40.600]   to this type of efficiency.
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:42.720]   Yeah, and we shouldn't have to take vacations
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:45.520]   to expensive sunny places to overcome this stuff.
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:47.200]   That's not the right way to think about it.
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:48.840]   The way is to try and weave it into our lives
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:50.960]   at low expense or no expense,
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:54.440]   getting outside, for instance, opening windows.
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:57.000]   In cars, it's the worst.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.240]   So what's wild is if you go to the Pacific Northwest
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:03.160]   in the fall or winter when it's really hard to get light,
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:04.960]   I think Seattle's the northernmost city
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:06.040]   in the contiguous US.
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:07.240]   It's so dark up there.
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:08.840]   And you get into an Uber.
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:10.320]   They have tinted windows.
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:11.520]   It's so crazy.
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:13.400]   Like, it's so wild,
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:14.960]   especially since the research on this stuff
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:16.120]   is being pioneered largely
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.600]   out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:21.320]   Like, we've got a number of things exactly backwards.
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:23.360]   And light in our relationship to light
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:25.200]   is one of the ways in which we do.
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:27.240]   The problem, I think, is when we start talking like this,
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:29.680]   people think, oh, well, we're all supposed to have
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:32.040]   atriums and skylights and be outside all day.
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:33.920]   And it's like, yeah, actually, that would be great
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:35.760]   and dimmer and darker at night.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:38.160]   So taking small steps towards adjusting
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:43.080]   toward bright days and very dim and dark nights is key.
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:44.880]   We didn't talk about incandescent bulbs.
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:47.560]   It used to be until about 15 years ago
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:49.760]   that the quote-unquote low-efficiency bulbs
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:51.480]   that were present in all our homes,
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:53.640]   the bulbs that would burn out pretty often,
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:56.680]   we know that the incandescent bulbs
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:59.720]   are more full-spectrum.
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:01.840]   They have a lot of red and orange emission.
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:04.280]   You see them as wider, but they look a little warmer.
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:07.480]   It has that warm, those are great.
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:08.320]   Those are great.
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:09.160]   They're harder to find now.
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:11.600]   Actually, they were illegal for a short while.
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:12.880]   I don't think anyone was gonna come to your house
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:14.560]   and arrest you, but you couldn't get them.
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:15.520]   They were banned.
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:17.640]   And now they're available again, is my understanding.
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:18.920]   - Oh, I haven't seen them,
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:21.480]   but I know that in new constructions,
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:23.520]   they're not even putting in sockets.
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:26.040]   They're putting in receptacles that can only be replaced
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.600]   with other LEDs.
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:30.000]   So in new constructions, that's what's going on.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.400]   We'll see what happens.
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:35.520]   I believe there is a movement right now
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:37.600]   based on the new administration
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.640]   to see if we can change some of those rules
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:41.120]   and maybe get some rule changes.
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:43.640]   I believe it's with the Department of Energy.
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:46.600]   - Do you know who are really the smartest about this stuff,
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:51.600]   that if you wanna know where self-directed human health
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.760]   is gonna be in five years, you know where you can look?
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:58.200]   - Tell me.
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:49:59.820]   - You talk to the people who are really good
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:04.280]   at maintaining aquaria and reptiles.
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:05.400]   - Ah, yes.
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:07.840]   - Because those animals literally die
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:09.620]   under conditions of pure blue light.
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:10.920]   Like if you've ever had fish tanks,
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:13.400]   I'm a fish tank, you don't wanna send me down this path,
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:15.760]   but there's a very famous fish tank designer.
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:16.880]   I was a huge fan of his.
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:19.720]   Unfortunately, he died of pneumonia when he was 60,
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:21.280]   Takashi Amano.
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:22.760]   There's museums in Japan about him.
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:24.280]   He developed this thing called aquascaping,
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:27.140]   which is about plants and lighting more than the fish,
[02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:28.040]   although there's fish in it.
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:30.640]   And everyone, I've been involved in aquascaping
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:33.120]   in one level or another for a while now.
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:36.160]   Super geeky, I know, but the whole principle
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:37.080]   is that you're trying to create
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:39.960]   full spectrum light, plants, air.
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:41.320]   You're trying to create the right conditions
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:43.960]   for these fish and other aquatic elements
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:45.820]   like plants to thrive.
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:49.320]   And anyone that understands how to maintain reptiles
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:50.960]   or understands how to, which I'm not into,
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:55.760]   I don't like scaly things except fish, or aquaria,
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:51:00.760]   they know you can't have a dearth of long wavelength light
[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:02.920]   or all the fish get sick.
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:04.520]   The plants die.
[02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:05.600]   They just can't do it.
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:07.440]   Now, there are deep sea plants where the red light,
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:10.040]   long wavelength light doesn't get down to the bottom.
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:11.720]   And forgive me for going off on this.
[02:51:11.720 --> 02:51:13.260]   Maybe I should just do a solo episode,
[02:51:13.260 --> 02:51:16.560]   but what's amazing is the intrinsically photosensitive
[02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:19.120]   cells of the eye that set our circadian rhythms
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:20.560]   and that do all this.
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:25.560]   The "reason" why the peak of the portion
[02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:31.920]   of the visible spectrum is where it is for those cells
[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:34.440]   is because it's the wavelength of light
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:36.860]   that can go deep into water.
[02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:37.880]   If you've ever been snorkeling,
[02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:41.080]   you only see reds down to about 10 meters or so.
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:42.520]   You swim down a little bit lower
[02:51:42.520 --> 02:51:44.280]   and you need to bring a light with you.
[02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:45.480]   Now, of course, the fish that are red
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:46.440]   are still red down there.
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:48.440]   You just can't see it because of the lack of reflectance
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:49.360]   of long wavelength light.
[02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:54.360]   So we are walking around in the evening,
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:59.000]   basically being exposed to what our eye and brain
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.280]   think is daytime, just as our retinal sensitivity
[02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:03.740]   is going up.
[02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:07.040]   And then all day we're in this and it's not bright enough.
[02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:08.560]   So anyway, I'll stop now.
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:12.560]   But it has me activated, as you can imagine,
[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:14.880]   because you hear about all the mental health issues,
[02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:16.520]   the physical health issues.
[02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:18.240]   I think they're all downstream, as you pointed out,
[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:20.360]   of mitochondrial dysfunction.
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:22.640]   Put differently, mitochondrial function is downstream
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:24.160]   of proper relationship to light.
[02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:25.000]   - Absolutely.
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:26.140]   - Which you so beautifully illustrated.
[02:52:26.140 --> 02:52:29.000]   And I learned a ton that I hadn't known before about that.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.640]   Okay.
[02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:34.920]   If I continued on Aquaria, we won't do that.
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:35.760]   We'll be here.
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:37.800]   This will be the longest podcast episode ever.
[02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:42.680]   I'd love to talk a little bit about two more things.
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:45.920]   We will return to New Start.
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:49.520]   But I want to know about long COVID.
[02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:52.720]   Is long COVID a real thing?
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:53.560]   - Oh yeah.
[02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:56.480]   - And what is long COVID?
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:52:58.520]   What can be done about long COVID?
[02:52:58.520 --> 02:53:01.960]   How do you know if, like most people by now
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:04.160]   have had COVID at a high level or a low level.
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:05.000]   - Yeah.
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.880]   - How do you know if you have long COVID?
[02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:10.000]   - Long COVID is defined as having symptoms
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:14.280]   of a number of different types of symptoms.
[02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:16.480]   Typically it's fatigue, could be headaches,
[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:18.600]   could be all sorts of things.
[02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:21.640]   Even loss of taste and smell
[02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:24.400]   for more than 12 weeks after the infection.
[02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:26.620]   So we're talking a good three months.
[02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:30.160]   The thing about long COVID in my experience
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:33.520]   and what I've seen is that it's very heterogeneous
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:35.520]   and it can be due to many different things.
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:39.160]   So it's been very difficult to put together
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:42.000]   exactly what the issue is.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:47.000]   But I'll tell you, as a physician, as a pulmonologist,
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:52.320]   one of the cardinal symptoms of long COVID
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:54.240]   is shortness of breath.
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:58.640]   And so because I'm a lung doctor
[02:53:58.640 --> 02:54:01.080]   and people believe that shortness of breath
[02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:02.760]   always has to do with the lungs,
[02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:05.400]   I get a lot of consults for people
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:07.920]   who have shortness of breath, long COVID
[02:54:07.920 --> 02:54:10.640]   after they were infected months ago.
[02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:12.160]   And so a lot of these people came to me
[02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:15.560]   and one of the things I had to do is research this topic.
[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:20.160]   And as it turns out, one of the,
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:23.440]   not for everybody, but for many people with long COVID,
[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:27.280]   guess what's at the center of long COVID?
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:29.220]   And actually we have research to show this,
[02:54:29.220 --> 02:54:30.480]   mitochondrial dysfunction.
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:33.800]   The thing that gets them COVID
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:36.320]   is the thing that keeps them actually having long COVID.
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:40.120]   So there was a study that was done looking at metabolism
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:42.280]   and they showed, it was one of these plots
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:44.880]   where they looked at up-regulation and down-regulation
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:47.280]   of metabolism in the mitochondria.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:51.160]   And they looked at the enzymes of glycolysis,
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:53.240]   if you can remember back all those enzymes,
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:56.040]   and they looked at the enzymes of beta-oxidation,
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:58.880]   so fatty acid, basically, oxidation.
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:01.000]   And it was pretty well shown
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.200]   that there was a significant down-regulation
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:05.320]   in people with long COVID
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:08.320]   versus people who had COVID that didn't have long COVID
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:11.840]   that had a down-regulation in beta-oxidation.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:15.440]   So they were not able to very well utilize
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:19.240]   and metabolize fatty acids in the mitochondria.
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:20.720]   Why is this the case?
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:22.960]   Well, based on what we talked about earlier,
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:25.280]   one of the, certainly one of the possibilities here
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:27.180]   is that they were infected with COVID.
[02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:30.360]   It down-regulated for many of the systems in their body,
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:33.160]   oxidative stress mechanisms,
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:35.440]   caused damage to their mitochondria.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:37.040]   And we don't know why,
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:39.720]   but perhaps the areas of the mitochondria
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:40.560]   that were damaged most
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:42.680]   had to do with beta-oxidation and fatty acids.
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:46.080]   So you'll talk to people who have been infected with COVID,
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:47.840]   and they said, "We gain weight
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:49.440]   after we're infected with COVID,
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:51.440]   and I have all these symptoms."
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:53.080]   First of all, when someone comes to you like that
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:55.360]   as a physician, you have to make sure
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:57.760]   that you're ruling out all of the obvious things.
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:55:59.160]   So I'm getting an echocardiogram
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:01.760]   to make sure they didn't have some sort of cardiac issue.
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:03.200]   I'm getting pulmonary function tests
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.600]   to make sure they didn't get scarring in their lungs
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:08.640]   and to have restrictive lung disease.
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:10.000]   So I'm ruling out all of these things.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.680]   And so about a month or two later,
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:14.480]   I've got all these tests back, and I'm going over it.
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:16.380]   And for the ones where everything is negative,
[02:56:16.380 --> 02:56:17.920]   'cause there were some where I actually discovered
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:20.320]   they had blood clots, and we had to treat them for that.
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:22.280]   But for people who have everything negative,
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:23.600]   and they're still complaining.
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:25.560]   I remember one gentleman in particular.
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:28.260]   He had eight out of 10 shortness of breath,
[02:56:28.260 --> 02:56:30.460]   and he couldn't sleep very well.
[02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:32.980]   And this had been going on for over a year.
[02:56:32.980 --> 02:56:34.820]   And we ruled out pulmonary embolism.
[02:56:34.820 --> 02:56:36.320]   We ruled out congestive heart failure.
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:38.340]   We ruled out interstitial lung disease
[02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:40.240]   with all of the tests.
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:41.080]   And it was about this time
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:43.900]   that I was coming out to this idea about light
[02:56:43.900 --> 02:56:46.160]   and looking at these studies about the mitochondria.
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:49.460]   And I had this idea, because there was nothing else left.
[02:56:49.460 --> 02:56:52.000]   I had this idea that if there was some way
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:55.180]   we could regenerate the mitochondria,
[02:56:55.180 --> 02:56:56.320]   but instead of it being damaged.
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:59.120]   Because you know, when you have damaged mitochondria,
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.160]   that creates just more oxidative stress
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:02.200]   and damages it even more.
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:04.900]   So in other words, we have to basically get his body
[02:57:04.900 --> 02:57:09.140]   into a situation where he was generating new mitochondria
[02:57:09.140 --> 02:57:11.780]   so we could get rid of these issues with metabolism.
[02:57:11.780 --> 02:57:14.680]   So I had this idea, and I don't know if it worked this way,
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:18.300]   but I actually got him to do intermittent fasting.
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:21.580]   And this whole idea about how intermittent fasting
[02:57:21.580 --> 02:57:25.780]   allows the body to generate things at night.
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:27.900]   Because you're now, the body knows
[02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:31.060]   what it needs to downregulate and break up.
[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:32.500]   You just have to give it the opportunity.
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:33.940]   This is how I understood it.
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:36.920]   The innate immune system looking at pathological
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:40.900]   molecular patterns and also damaged molecular patterns.
[02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:43.540]   So PAMPs and DAMPs, D-A-M-P.
[02:57:43.540 --> 02:57:44.980]   If we were to allow the immune system
[02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:47.420]   to do what it needs to do, it would find these areas
[02:57:47.420 --> 02:57:49.500]   that are not working well, tear them down,
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:52.460]   destroy those cells, and then allow regeneration
[02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:56.360]   of new cells with hopefully brand new virgin mitochondria.
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:57:57.520]   So that was the first thing I did.
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:00.160]   He vowed that he would never eat after 5.30,
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:01.580]   after I explained all this to him.
[02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:04.180]   I took a clinic visit and we explained all of this.
[02:58:04.180 --> 02:58:06.780]   The other thing I did was told him to get out and sun.
[02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:10.460]   Now this may sound dismissive.
[02:58:10.460 --> 02:58:11.900]   Can you imagine, you've got long COVID,
[02:58:11.900 --> 02:58:13.660]   you've been suffering, and you go to a physician
[02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:15.740]   and they tell you, well, I want you to stop eating
[02:58:15.740 --> 02:58:18.020]   after 5.30, I want you to get outside more.
[02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:19.980]   Like, is he taking me seriously?
[02:58:19.980 --> 02:58:22.500]   Does he really believe that I have a condition?
[02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:25.420]   But I took the time to explain why I was thinking
[02:58:25.420 --> 02:58:27.280]   about these things and going through the studies.
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:28.700]   So he did it.
[02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:31.200]   And I saw him back a month later.
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:36.300]   He was amazed, I was amazed.
[02:58:36.300 --> 02:58:41.260]   He said that his gastroesophageal reflex disease
[02:58:41.260 --> 02:58:44.860]   completely went away after he stopped eating after 5.30.
[02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:47.220]   His shortness of breath went from an eight out of 10
[02:58:47.220 --> 02:58:48.780]   to a three out of 10.
[02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:51.300]   And he said it doesn't even bother him anymore.
[02:58:51.300 --> 02:58:56.300]   This is after a year of having this type of symptoms.
[02:58:56.300 --> 02:58:58.040]   So that really took me a pause.
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:58:59.620]   Now, I'll tell you the first thing.
[02:58:59.620 --> 02:59:02.340]   That doesn't happen to all of my patients with long COVID.
[02:59:02.340 --> 02:59:06.580]   But it tells me that when you're dealing with long COVID,
[02:59:06.580 --> 02:59:11.220]   you're dealing with people who have had an infection
[02:59:11.220 --> 02:59:14.540]   that has caused damage to the system.
[02:59:14.540 --> 02:59:16.920]   And some of the studies from what I've reviewed,
[02:59:16.920 --> 02:59:20.820]   sometimes people have residual virus still in the system.
[02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:22.140]   There was a study that was done looking at
[02:59:22.140 --> 02:59:24.860]   to see whether vaccination of COVID-19
[02:59:24.860 --> 02:59:27.320]   would work after patients with long COVID.
[02:59:27.320 --> 02:59:29.420]   There was some benefit.
[02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:30.980]   It wasn't big, but it was some.
[02:59:30.980 --> 02:59:33.660]   And it may be that you're just stimulating
[02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:37.260]   the immune system again to fight off this remaining virus
[02:59:37.260 --> 02:59:38.620]   that's still in the system.
[02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:45.500]   But we have data that shows that the type of inflammation
[02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:47.060]   that we get with spike protein,
[02:59:47.060 --> 02:59:49.500]   it's actually a toll-like receptor four type of inflammation.
[02:59:49.500 --> 02:59:51.140]   There's a study that looked at this.
[02:59:51.140 --> 02:59:53.660]   And they were actually able to show and demonstrate
[02:59:53.660 --> 02:59:56.100]   that infrared light, coming back to that again,
[02:59:56.100 --> 02:59:58.540]   can actually mitigate the inflammation
[02:59:58.540 --> 03:00:01.580]   from toll-like receptor-mediated inflammation,
[03:00:01.580 --> 03:00:05.540]   which is exactly the inflammation mediated in COVID-19.
[03:00:05.540 --> 03:00:08.400]   So short answer to your question, or that's a long answer,
[03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:09.540]   but the short answer is yes,
[03:00:09.540 --> 03:00:11.580]   I do believe that long COVID is something,
[03:00:11.580 --> 03:00:13.820]   and I believe people are suffering with it.
[03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:17.460]   It's a very heterogeneous disease,
[03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:19.920]   and it's hard to just pin one thing on everything
[03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:21.740]   and have it work for everything.
[03:00:21.740 --> 03:00:24.580]   That being said, I don't see a lot of downside
[03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:27.620]   in instituting some of these things that we think may work,
[03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:30.020]   sunlight as being one of those things.
[03:00:30.020 --> 03:00:33.460]   People who are sick with COVID and long COVID
[03:00:33.460 --> 03:00:35.680]   tend to be sick and they stay indoors.
[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:37.820]   And so there may be an exacerbation of the process.
[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:40.580]   The last thing they wanna do is to get outside,
[03:00:40.580 --> 03:00:42.280]   but it may actually be beneficial.
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:45.540]   - Yeah, I would imagine that pretty much everything
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:48.260]   that you've shared with us today would be beneficial.
[03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:51.140]   My understanding is that some of the heterogeneity
[03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:54.900]   of even just the COVID response in various people
[03:00:54.900 --> 03:00:58.100]   who got it in addition to the heterogeneity
[03:00:58.100 --> 03:01:00.440]   and long COVID symptoms could be due to the fact
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:03.700]   that the distribution of ACE2 receptors
[03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:05.440]   is very widespread in the body.
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:10.620]   SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor.
[03:01:10.620 --> 03:01:13.500]   It's a primary receptor site, as I understand.
[03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:16.180]   And I remember early in the pandemic
[03:01:18.380 --> 03:01:19.900]   asking on social media,
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:22.580]   are there ACE2 receptors in the brain and on neurons?
[03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:24.380]   And people were like, no, there's no ACE2 receptor.
[03:01:24.380 --> 03:01:27.220]   It turns out the olfactory neurons
[03:01:27.220 --> 03:01:30.500]   are chock-a-block full of ACE2 receptor
[03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:35.500]   and they are bonafide CNS neurons, their brain neurons.
[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:38.140]   And you lose them.
[03:01:38.140 --> 03:01:40.420]   Fortunately, those can replenish over time
[03:01:40.420 --> 03:01:42.260]   in an activity-dependent way.
[03:01:42.260 --> 03:01:45.060]   But yeah, when I hear that some people got COVID
[03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:47.060]   and it was no big deal, other people got COVID
[03:01:47.060 --> 03:01:50.020]   and they felt like they had brain fog for six months
[03:01:50.020 --> 03:01:51.260]   and are still coping with it,
[03:01:51.260 --> 03:01:53.900]   probably has to do with the extent to which the virus
[03:01:53.900 --> 03:01:57.620]   was able to bind to ACE2 receptors in one person's brain
[03:01:57.620 --> 03:01:58.460]   versus someone else.
[03:01:58.460 --> 03:02:00.740]   Maybe their blood-brain barrier,
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:01.900]   it didn't get in there at all.
[03:02:01.900 --> 03:02:05.060]   - Right, yeah, as I recall from the,
[03:02:05.060 --> 03:02:07.180]   from the, and this is actually kind of interesting
[03:02:07.180 --> 03:02:10.060]   about olfactory, is that the nurse cells
[03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:12.620]   that are next to those neurons in the olfactory
[03:02:12.620 --> 03:02:15.740]   are the ones that have a lot of ACE2 receptors.
[03:02:15.740 --> 03:02:18.900]   And that's, so what happened is these nurse-supporting cells
[03:02:18.900 --> 03:02:20.940]   that were helping with the, you know,
[03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:23.220]   whatever they do to support the neurons were dying off
[03:02:23.220 --> 03:02:24.900]   and that's why they were losing a sense of smell.
[03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:28.300]   And so when the nurse cells came back and replenished,
[03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:30.460]   people didn't smell exactly the same
[03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:33.060]   because it wasn't exactly in the same,
[03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:34.820]   didn't come back in the same way.
[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:37.420]   There was, and this has been used for years
[03:02:37.420 --> 03:02:39.740]   in ear, nose, and throat circles,
[03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:43.140]   is something as, this sounds kind of silly,
[03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:45.300]   but smelling sticks.
[03:02:45.300 --> 03:02:47.460]   There's actually a protocol that is used
[03:02:47.460 --> 03:02:50.260]   that these markers that are manufactured in Europe,
[03:02:50.260 --> 03:02:52.580]   where they have a different, different-
[03:02:52.580 --> 03:02:54.140]   - Yeah, orange, lemon, chocolate.
[03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:54.980]   - Exactly. - Yeah.
[03:02:54.980 --> 03:02:57.940]   - And smelling these things actually over,
[03:02:57.940 --> 03:03:00.820]   there was a randomized crossover placebo-controlled trial
[03:03:00.820 --> 03:03:02.020]   that actually showed that they were able
[03:03:02.020 --> 03:03:03.900]   to regain their sense of smell
[03:03:03.900 --> 03:03:06.780]   by training their sense of smell with these sticks.
[03:03:06.780 --> 03:03:09.500]   - It makes sense because the olfactory neurons
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:12.260]   are replenished, not just regenerate,
[03:03:12.260 --> 03:03:16.340]   but they turn over in an activity-dependent way.
[03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:18.140]   And so it requires electrical activity
[03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:21.060]   and their electrical activity is dictated by smell.
[03:03:21.060 --> 03:03:22.460]   - Smell, got it.
[03:03:22.460 --> 03:03:24.700]   - And so certain clusters of olfactory neurons
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:26.660]   and the brain neurons that they connect to
[03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:28.420]   or reconnect to in this case
[03:03:28.420 --> 03:03:30.300]   are going to be activated by different smells.
[03:03:30.300 --> 03:03:32.900]   And so the smell training-based protocols
[03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:34.940]   for bringing your sense of smell back
[03:03:34.940 --> 03:03:39.780]   intentionally includes a variety of smells.
[03:03:39.780 --> 03:03:41.020]   You don't just want to smell a lemon,
[03:03:41.020 --> 03:03:43.780]   you want to smell lemon, coffee, this.
[03:03:43.780 --> 03:03:46.220]   People always say, "Do I need foul smells too?"
[03:03:46.220 --> 03:03:49.580]   In kind of an unfortunate way,
[03:03:49.580 --> 03:03:53.660]   the neurons that detect noxious odors and bad odors
[03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:56.820]   tend to not die off as readily.
[03:03:56.820 --> 03:03:57.660]   - Oh, I see.
[03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:59.460]   - But it makes sense because those are the cells
[03:03:59.460 --> 03:04:03.540]   that actually preserve your innate aversion reflex.
[03:04:03.540 --> 03:04:04.380]   - Right.
[03:04:04.380 --> 03:04:05.740]   - They're the ones that can,
[03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:08.760]   our ability to detect smoke in the air,
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:11.260]   something very relevant to the recent history here in LA,
[03:04:11.260 --> 03:04:15.980]   or ammonia, things that are potentially hazardous for us,
[03:04:15.980 --> 03:04:18.700]   the detection thresholds are incredibly low.
[03:04:18.700 --> 03:04:19.940]   We're just so sensitive.
[03:04:19.940 --> 03:04:21.380]   - This is like the fifth cranial nerve, isn't it,
[03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:22.580]   that does that?
[03:04:22.580 --> 03:04:24.340]   - Well, yeah, so the trigeminal,
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:28.220]   it's involved in some of the protection
[03:04:28.220 --> 03:04:31.260]   of the nasal epithelium and whatnot.
[03:04:31.260 --> 03:04:33.820]   But this is a direct line
[03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:36.820]   through the olfactory pathway to the amygdala,
[03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:38.140]   a fairly direct line.
[03:04:38.140 --> 03:04:40.160]   - That's right, it bypasses the thalamus.
[03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:41.200]   - Right, so, right.
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:42.840]   All of olfaction bypasses the thalamus,
[03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:45.200]   but the learning of odors is,
[03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:48.160]   your odor maps are gonna be slightly different
[03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:49.640]   than mine based on your experience.
[03:04:49.640 --> 03:04:52.920]   But when it comes to the representation of smoke,
[03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:57.920]   vomit, feces, and rotting bodies, all the dangerous stuff,
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:00.920]   our pathways look pretty similar.
[03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:01.760]   - Got it.
[03:05:01.760 --> 03:05:02.800]   - Got it, to be blunt.
[03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:07.220]   Given your expertise in lungs,
[03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:12.220]   and a number of people I know have mold issues.
[03:05:12.220 --> 03:05:14.680]   They claim or they believe
[03:05:14.680 --> 03:05:17.880]   that mold has infiltrated their lungs.
[03:05:17.880 --> 03:05:20.480]   Some doctors tell them they're crazy.
[03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:22.960]   Some doctors tell them that they're not crazy
[03:05:22.960 --> 03:05:24.600]   about that idea.
[03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:27.780]   Is mold toxicity a real thing?
[03:05:27.780 --> 03:05:28.920]   Can it be treated?
[03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:31.280]   Maybe we do an entire episode about this another time,
[03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:33.800]   but is it a real thing?
[03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:35.960]   And what is the kind of primary treatment
[03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:37.400]   for mold toxicity?
[03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:39.000]   - It is a real thing.
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:42.320]   And mold is a substance
[03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:46.440]   that can have multiple different effects on the body.
[03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:48.320]   Let me give you an example.
[03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:51.360]   There's a fungus called aspergillus.
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:54.000]   And there's two ways that aspergillus
[03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:55.680]   can affect the human body.
[03:05:55.680 --> 03:05:59.040]   One is if it just sets up shop in your lungs
[03:05:59.040 --> 03:06:02.760]   and it doesn't invade, you could become allergic to it.
[03:06:02.760 --> 03:06:04.320]   And so the symptoms are allergic.
[03:06:04.320 --> 03:06:05.200]   Actually, there's a condition
[03:06:05.200 --> 03:06:07.840]   called allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
[03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:10.100]   - So it's kind of like an autoimmune situation.
[03:06:10.100 --> 03:06:12.320]   - Exactly, and so you have symptoms of asthma.
[03:06:12.320 --> 03:06:15.680]   You have symptoms of inability to breathe.
[03:06:15.680 --> 03:06:18.680]   And the primary treatment, ironically, there is steroids,
[03:06:18.680 --> 03:06:21.040]   because you need to reduce the inflammation,
[03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:23.840]   but also antifungals to get rid of the thing
[03:06:23.840 --> 03:06:25.740]   that's inciting in the first place.
[03:06:25.740 --> 03:06:29.200]   That's as opposed to invasive aspergillosis.
[03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:32.640]   That's where the fungus comes in and starts to invade
[03:06:32.640 --> 03:06:34.520]   and create a cavitary lesion,
[03:06:34.520 --> 03:06:36.840]   usually with a fungus ball sitting in the middle of it.
[03:06:36.840 --> 03:06:38.400]   Oh yeah, it's pretty bad.
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:40.760]   Sometimes it's so bad that you actually have to do surgery
[03:06:40.760 --> 03:06:43.160]   to cut out that thing 'cause you can't cure it.
[03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:47.880]   The way that this often happens
[03:06:47.880 --> 03:06:52.680]   is mold and fungus are in the air all the time.
[03:06:52.680 --> 03:06:57.120]   So here's this understanding of there's germ theory
[03:06:57.120 --> 03:06:59.560]   and there is terrain theory.
[03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:02.960]   And today, and I almost hate to even get into it,
[03:07:02.960 --> 03:07:05.620]   but people think it's one or the other.
[03:07:05.620 --> 03:07:08.080]   And I can tell you as a physician, it's both.
[03:07:08.080 --> 03:07:09.440]   There are certain diseases,
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:11.800]   it doesn't matter what your terrain is,
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:14.080]   it's gonna, like Neisseria meningitidis,
[03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:17.360]   if you get that, it's gonna cause a bad meningitis,
[03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:20.200]   no matter how healthy you are, okay?
[03:07:20.200 --> 03:07:22.280]   There was just, I remember reading
[03:07:22.280 --> 03:07:26.960]   about a young Japanese star, I think, or Taiwanese star,
[03:07:26.960 --> 03:07:30.080]   just recently here, that died of influenza.
[03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:32.680]   48 years old, no medical problems.
[03:07:32.680 --> 03:07:35.920]   So it's possible, no matter how good your terrain is,
[03:07:35.920 --> 03:07:38.960]   you could get a bad bug, a bad germ, and it could kill you.
[03:07:38.960 --> 03:07:40.820]   On the other hand, there are certain bugs
[03:07:40.820 --> 03:07:43.160]   that are just sitting out there and they will go in
[03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:44.880]   and your immune system will just kick it out
[03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:46.080]   like it's nothing, why?
[03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:47.920]   Because your terrain is good.
[03:07:47.920 --> 03:07:51.880]   Because, so I can talk about different types of infections
[03:07:51.880 --> 03:07:53.120]   that could do that.
[03:07:53.120 --> 03:07:56.240]   So that's where we are with molds.
[03:07:56.240 --> 03:08:00.240]   So typically, you're breathing in all sorts of molds
[03:08:00.240 --> 03:08:02.780]   and fungus spores all the time.
[03:08:02.780 --> 03:08:05.080]   But if your immune system is good,
[03:08:05.080 --> 03:08:07.360]   it'll just kick it out and won't have a chance to survive.
[03:08:07.360 --> 03:08:10.980]   Where you have a problem is if you have a situation
[03:08:10.980 --> 03:08:13.680]   where your immune system is compromised.
[03:08:13.680 --> 03:08:15.800]   To give you an example of that practically,
[03:08:15.800 --> 03:08:19.880]   there are some biological medications that people get
[03:08:19.880 --> 03:08:22.120]   when they have rheumatoid arthritis.
[03:08:22.120 --> 03:08:24.000]   Before we, if we get to that point
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:25.380]   where you have rheumatitis so bad
[03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:26.920]   that we have to put you on a biologic,
[03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:28.440]   that means there's an antibody there
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:30.480]   that's suppressing the immune system
[03:08:30.480 --> 03:08:31.960]   so that you don't have the symptoms
[03:08:31.960 --> 03:08:33.340]   of rheumatoid arthritis.
[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:35.400]   That's actually suppressing your immune system.
[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:39.560]   In those patients, we'll always check them for tuberculosis
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:41.840]   because certain people walking in the population
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:44.200]   will have an inactivated tuberculosis.
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:47.060]   They're infected, but their immune system has walled it off.
[03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:51.000]   Then we put them on a biologic and the tuberculosis pops up.
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.700]   So all of that to say that, yes, it is possible.
[03:08:53.700 --> 03:08:55.800]   If you have mold in your house
[03:08:55.800 --> 03:08:57.360]   versus if you don't have mold in your house,
[03:08:57.360 --> 03:09:00.440]   that just increases the burden of mold that you're inhaling.
[03:09:00.440 --> 03:09:02.480]   And to the degree that it's gonna match
[03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:05.820]   against your immune system,
[03:09:05.820 --> 03:09:09.080]   that could depend on whether or not it jumps in
[03:09:09.080 --> 03:09:10.320]   and actually causes a problem.
[03:09:10.320 --> 03:09:12.920]   So we're coming up, this is the time of year
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:14.200]   where we're coming up to the Super Bowl.
[03:09:14.200 --> 03:09:17.760]   So it's the question about terrain theory
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:20.040]   versus germ theory.
[03:09:20.040 --> 03:09:22.120]   And the question is, whoever wins the Super Bowl,
[03:09:22.120 --> 03:09:23.940]   did they win the Super Bowl
[03:09:23.940 --> 03:09:26.200]   or did the other team lose the Super Bowl?
[03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:28.860]   And that's, who knows?
[03:09:28.860 --> 03:09:32.900]   So this is where this thing, it's not or, it's and.
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:35.140]   And really what determines whether or not you get infected
[03:09:35.140 --> 03:09:37.220]   is how good is your immune system
[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:39.260]   and how virulent is the burden
[03:09:39.260 --> 03:09:41.260]   of a pathogen that's going in.
[03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:43.020]   - The reason I asked, is it a real thing,
[03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:44.460]   is that people that I know
[03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:49.460]   who believe they have a mold infection or they did
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:52.420]   do seem to have symptoms that last a long time.
[03:09:52.420 --> 03:09:56.460]   And there doesn't seem to be any general agreement
[03:09:56.460 --> 03:09:59.900]   about what specific treatment to use for this,
[03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:02.580]   unless maybe they need surgery or something.
[03:10:02.580 --> 03:10:05.400]   So do you give people antifungals?
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:08.480]   Is there anything over the counter that can help?
[03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:10.660]   Will the sauna protocols and steam protocols
[03:10:10.660 --> 03:10:11.700]   we were talking about earlier help?
[03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:14.140]   I would imagine a lot of warm, moist air
[03:10:14.140 --> 03:10:15.780]   is exactly what fungus loves.
[03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:17.700]   - Yes, it does.
[03:10:18.940 --> 03:10:22.860]   If someone came to me with a mold complaint
[03:10:22.860 --> 03:10:24.380]   or thinking they had mold,
[03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:25.620]   there are a number of tests that you can do
[03:10:25.620 --> 03:10:27.880]   to see whether or not there's antibodies to those things.
[03:10:27.880 --> 03:10:29.880]   And you can see whether or not that may or may not be there.
[03:10:29.880 --> 03:10:31.420]   It's not definitive.
[03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:34.220]   But if somebody actually truly has mold
[03:10:34.220 --> 03:10:35.540]   growing in their lungs,
[03:10:35.540 --> 03:10:37.460]   we should be able to see that on a CAT scan.
[03:10:37.460 --> 03:10:39.220]   We should be able to identify it.
[03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:40.760]   We should be able to go and biopsy it.
[03:10:40.760 --> 03:10:42.340]   We should be able to go in and collect it.
[03:10:42.340 --> 03:10:44.680]   And if that's exactly what grows out on the culture
[03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:47.180]   after we take a biopsy or a culture,
[03:10:47.180 --> 03:10:51.340]   then we can tailor antifungals for that particular thing.
[03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:54.220]   In the sense, though, that someone may be having symptoms
[03:10:54.220 --> 03:10:56.140]   of some sort of infection or something,
[03:10:56.140 --> 03:10:58.740]   and there's nothing on the CAT scan,
[03:10:58.740 --> 03:11:01.460]   it's harder to really isolate exactly which one it would be
[03:11:01.460 --> 03:11:02.820]   and what would be the right treatment.
[03:11:02.820 --> 03:11:07.820]   Although, there are some syndromes known as RADS,
[03:11:07.820 --> 03:11:10.300]   or reactive airways disease,
[03:11:10.300 --> 03:11:12.380]   where you can have an exposure
[03:11:12.380 --> 03:11:15.780]   to something that's so egregious
[03:11:15.780 --> 03:11:18.220]   that even though you don't get exposed to that thing again,
[03:11:18.220 --> 03:11:22.340]   it can still cause persistent difficulty with breathing.
[03:11:22.340 --> 03:11:26.340]   It's very similar, by the way, to asthma.
[03:11:26.340 --> 03:11:29.660]   So, for instance, let's say someone's working in a vat,
[03:11:29.660 --> 03:11:31.700]   and there's a chemical that's spilled,
[03:11:31.700 --> 03:11:33.500]   and they get an incredible amount
[03:11:33.500 --> 03:11:35.780]   of inhalation of that chemical.
[03:11:35.780 --> 03:11:37.960]   It's well-known that these people can go on
[03:11:37.960 --> 03:11:39.500]   and have these types of problems,
[03:11:39.500 --> 03:11:43.660]   even though their lungs may image correctly,
[03:11:43.660 --> 03:11:46.300]   and they may never be exposed to that chemical again.
[03:11:46.300 --> 03:11:50.760]   - Let's talk about the T in New Start, trust.
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:57.500]   You talked about higher power, you talked about community,
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:12:02.140]   you talked about connection generally and specifically.
[03:12:02.140 --> 03:12:06.540]   I've always been struck by how the belief system
[03:12:06.540 --> 03:12:09.500]   can impact our physical health.
[03:12:09.500 --> 03:12:11.740]   We recently had Dr. Ellen Langer
[03:12:11.740 --> 03:12:12.860]   on the podcast from Harvard,
[03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:14.820]   who's done incredible studies, really,
[03:12:14.820 --> 03:12:18.260]   about how beliefs can shape our physical health
[03:12:18.260 --> 03:12:19.980]   in any number of different ways.
[03:12:19.980 --> 03:12:26.020]   What is your clinical observation of people who are ill,
[03:12:26.020 --> 03:12:29.740]   severely ill, mildly ill,
[03:12:29.740 --> 03:12:33.960]   and the role that trust in, fill in the blank,
[03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:35.940]   you can fill in the blank,
[03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:39.580]   has in terms of the severity of their symptoms
[03:12:39.580 --> 03:12:41.520]   and the rate at which they recover,
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:42.740]   and hopefully they do recover?
[03:12:42.740 --> 03:12:43.680]   - Yeah, they do.
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:46.100]   Some of the times, sometimes they don't,
[03:12:46.100 --> 03:12:49.060]   and we can't help that, but we do the best that we can.
[03:12:49.060 --> 03:12:50.740]   No, it does help quite a bit.
[03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:55.740]   So people who have a network,
[03:12:55.740 --> 03:12:59.940]   people that have faith, people that have community,
[03:12:59.940 --> 03:13:03.020]   have that strength that allows them
[03:13:03.020 --> 03:13:06.500]   to get through those very difficult times.
[03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:08.780]   There's been a number of studies that have looked at this.
[03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:10.820]   You'd think that this area is kind of nebulous
[03:13:10.820 --> 03:13:11.660]   and hard to study.
[03:13:11.660 --> 03:13:14.980]   No, there's actually some pretty good data on this.
[03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:18.340]   And I think back to a number of studies that have been done
[03:13:18.340 --> 03:13:20.340]   and where they looked at thankfulness
[03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:22.300]   and the mind-body connection.
[03:13:22.300 --> 03:13:27.300]   People who are more thankful have less somatic complaints,
[03:13:27.300 --> 03:13:29.760]   for instance, than those that are not.
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:31.520]   So they actually did an experiment
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:33.460]   where they had people write out letters.
[03:13:33.460 --> 03:13:35.500]   They thought about some mentors in their past,
[03:13:35.500 --> 03:13:37.860]   and they wrote out letters to thank them.
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:38.900]   And it was interesting,
[03:13:38.900 --> 03:13:41.300]   because not all of the people that wrote the letters
[03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:43.380]   were able to actually deliver those letters
[03:13:43.380 --> 03:13:46.020]   to those recipients, but it didn't matter.
[03:13:46.020 --> 03:13:47.020]   What they found in the study
[03:13:47.020 --> 03:13:50.620]   was just simply the thought of writing out those letters
[03:13:50.620 --> 03:13:54.220]   actually had a change in the endpoints in those studies.
[03:13:54.220 --> 03:13:55.460]   There was another study that was done
[03:13:55.460 --> 03:13:57.300]   that was very telling to me.
[03:13:57.300 --> 03:13:59.620]   It was a survey that was done of 1,500 people.
[03:13:59.620 --> 03:14:02.120]   It was published out of Texas.
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:03.140]   In this particular case,
[03:14:03.140 --> 03:14:07.580]   they wanted to limit the population of the recipients.
[03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:09.780]   So these were just Christians in this case,
[03:14:09.780 --> 03:14:11.740]   just because of the heterogeneity.
[03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:13.880]   They wanted to see if they can get an endpoint.
[03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:18.720]   And what they did was they asked people in this survey,
[03:14:18.720 --> 03:14:20.100]   how do you forgive?
[03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:21.380]   Forgiveness has to do a little bit
[03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:24.300]   about faith and trust as well.
[03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:27.560]   And there was basically two major types of forgiveness.
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:30.220]   There was forgiveness that was conditional,
[03:14:30.220 --> 03:14:33.180]   and there was forgiveness that was unconditional.
[03:14:33.180 --> 03:14:35.360]   And what I mean by that is that people
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:37.220]   that would forgive conditionally would be,
[03:14:37.220 --> 03:14:38.900]   if someone did something to somebody,
[03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:41.380]   they might forgive them if they came back and apologized,
[03:14:41.380 --> 03:14:43.540]   or they showed some sort of remorse.
[03:14:43.540 --> 03:14:46.660]   Those are the people that forgave conditionally.
[03:14:46.660 --> 03:14:48.880]   The other people who forgave unconditionally
[03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:50.420]   were the ones that would just forgive
[03:14:50.420 --> 03:14:51.860]   regardless of what that other person would do.
[03:14:51.860 --> 03:14:52.900]   They would just forgive them,
[03:14:52.900 --> 03:14:54.060]   and it would be off their mind.
[03:14:54.060 --> 03:14:56.460]   They would just go on their way.
[03:14:56.460 --> 03:14:57.900]   What they found was really interesting
[03:14:57.900 --> 03:14:59.140]   between those two populations.
[03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:00.580]   Now, this was an associative study,
[03:15:00.580 --> 03:15:04.260]   but they found that when they looked at anxiety
[03:15:04.260 --> 03:15:08.980]   at the end of life in terms of dying,
[03:15:08.980 --> 03:15:12.340]   well-being, somatosensory complaints,
[03:15:12.340 --> 03:15:14.700]   all sorts of, a whole list of different things,
[03:15:14.700 --> 03:15:18.780]   they found that people who forgave conditionally,
[03:15:18.780 --> 03:15:21.520]   the ones that would wait for someone to come back to them,
[03:15:21.520 --> 03:15:23.860]   had higher marks in those cases.
[03:15:23.860 --> 03:15:25.780]   In other words, they had more anxiety.
[03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:28.580]   They had more somato complaints.
[03:15:28.580 --> 03:15:31.540]   They were less feeling of well-being.
[03:15:32.980 --> 03:15:34.420]   And so they found that that was really interesting.
[03:15:34.420 --> 03:15:35.320]   Well, they didn't stop there.
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:37.500]   They wanted to figure out what was going on.
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:39.500]   And they asked the question,
[03:15:39.500 --> 03:15:41.900]   okay, well, what is the biggest determinant
[03:15:41.900 --> 03:15:45.740]   that determines whether or not somebody forgives
[03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:48.460]   conditionally versus unconditionally?
[03:15:48.460 --> 03:15:50.820]   And I think the odds ratio on this statement
[03:15:50.820 --> 03:15:53.380]   was like a two or three, which is getting up there.
[03:15:53.380 --> 03:15:55.820]   It's almost, you could say that the likelihood ratios
[03:15:55.820 --> 03:15:57.940]   are high enough to say causation, but not quite,
[03:15:57.940 --> 03:16:00.780]   but it was high, and it came down to this statement.
[03:16:00.780 --> 03:16:03.840]   And the statement was,
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:06.920]   do you feel like you have been forgiven by God?
[03:16:06.920 --> 03:16:11.460]   If they felt like they were forgiven by God,
[03:16:11.460 --> 03:16:14.900]   they were much more likely to forgive unconditionally.
[03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:17.340]   If they had ever felt that they were forgiven by God.
[03:16:17.340 --> 03:16:19.400]   If they feel like they were forgiven by God, yes,
[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:21.340]   for whatever it was that they had done.
[03:16:21.340 --> 03:16:24.940]   So this was really interesting to me
[03:16:24.940 --> 03:16:29.500]   because oftentimes I will have patients
[03:16:29.500 --> 03:16:33.700]   in my intensive care unit who are very anxious.
[03:16:33.700 --> 03:16:34.780]   They know that, I mean,
[03:16:34.780 --> 03:16:36.740]   anybody who gets admitted to the hospital
[03:16:36.740 --> 03:16:38.260]   starts to think about the mortality.
[03:16:38.260 --> 03:16:41.460]   Just imagine if you get admitted to the intensive care unit.
[03:16:41.460 --> 03:16:44.340]   A lot of my patients are not able to communicate.
[03:16:44.340 --> 03:16:45.780]   They're mentally out.
[03:16:45.780 --> 03:16:47.900]   But there are a few that can.
[03:16:47.900 --> 03:16:51.260]   And those, you can tell, become very anxious.
[03:16:51.260 --> 03:16:54.300]   So this is an area that I have to sort of
[03:16:54.300 --> 03:16:56.420]   delicately ask about
[03:16:56.420 --> 03:16:58.700]   because you don't know people's faith structure.
[03:16:58.700 --> 03:17:00.380]   You don't know who they are.
[03:17:00.380 --> 03:17:02.780]   I'm a graduate of Loma Linda University,
[03:17:02.780 --> 03:17:05.980]   and our motto, and it's a Christian institution,
[03:17:05.980 --> 03:17:08.220]   is to make man whole.
[03:17:08.220 --> 03:17:10.680]   And part of that is not just the physical,
[03:17:10.680 --> 03:17:12.520]   not just the mental,
[03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:14.280]   but also the spiritual aspect of that.
[03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:17.380]   So we make no excuses about that.
[03:17:17.380 --> 03:17:19.300]   But it's important to also understand
[03:17:19.300 --> 03:17:21.580]   that not everybody wants to have
[03:17:21.580 --> 03:17:22.940]   a spiritual component to their care.
[03:17:22.940 --> 03:17:26.260]   So you have to approach it in a way that you're almost,
[03:17:26.260 --> 03:17:27.740]   do you give me permission to do this?
[03:17:27.740 --> 03:17:29.340]   And you have to watch for things.
[03:17:29.340 --> 03:17:30.620]   It's not an easy thing to do,
[03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:33.180]   but you wanna help if someone wants to be helped.
[03:17:33.180 --> 03:17:36.940]   So oftentimes, I will talk to them about this very issue,
[03:17:36.940 --> 03:17:40.840]   and I will say, you know, is there something on your mind
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:42.300]   that you need to get off your chest?
[03:17:42.300 --> 03:17:44.300]   You would be surprised about how many times
[03:17:44.300 --> 03:17:46.140]   people have this issue.
[03:17:46.140 --> 03:17:48.300]   It's because they've done something
[03:17:48.300 --> 03:17:50.220]   to somebody in their past,
[03:17:50.220 --> 03:17:52.420]   and they don't feel like they're forgiven.
[03:17:52.420 --> 03:17:55.580]   And if you have the opportunity to do that,
[03:17:55.580 --> 03:17:57.660]   to actually give them that ability
[03:17:57.660 --> 03:18:00.940]   in their belief structure,
[03:18:00.940 --> 03:18:02.900]   to tell them that they are forgiven,
[03:18:02.900 --> 03:18:05.660]   there's a world of difference.
[03:18:05.660 --> 03:18:08.340]   And it's quite, actually, it's quite amazing.
[03:18:08.340 --> 03:18:14.260]   It's interesting to me that in all hospitals,
[03:18:14.260 --> 03:18:18.340]   not just hospitals with an affiliation
[03:18:18.340 --> 03:18:21.100]   to a particular branch of religion,
[03:18:21.100 --> 03:18:22.400]   you have chaplains.
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:23.240]   Yeah.
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:26.560]   You have different people associated often
[03:18:26.560 --> 03:18:28.760]   with different religions that people can call upon,
[03:18:28.760 --> 03:18:30.360]   which I find amazing, right?
[03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:34.200]   In this quote-unquote modern time, you know,
[03:18:34.200 --> 03:18:35.680]   of modern medicine.
[03:18:35.680 --> 03:18:36.840]   Right.
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:40.000]   As far as I know, every major hospital has this.
[03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:41.420]   It doesn't matter how cutting edge
[03:18:41.420 --> 03:18:43.840]   or how small a community hospital,
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:46.720]   which by the way, many community hospitals are excellent.
[03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:47.560]   Yes.
[03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:48.380]   I should point that out.
[03:18:48.380 --> 03:18:50.120]   The words community hospital juxtaposed
[03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:52.920]   to, you know, a cutting edge research institution.
[03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:54.080]   You know, there's actually a debate
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:56.200]   as to like which one you would prefer to go to,
[03:18:56.200 --> 03:18:57.640]   depending on your needs.
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:02.640]   But they all have, generally, as far as I know,
[03:19:02.640 --> 03:19:07.640]   have access to people with whom patients
[03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:10.560]   and family of patients and friends of patients can pray.
[03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:13.120]   And that's not a coincidence.
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:15.000]   I think that there's a deep understanding
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:18.080]   of some sort of relationship there.
[03:19:19.020 --> 03:19:22.140]   And certainly there's good science
[03:19:22.140 --> 03:19:24.060]   to support everything you just said.
[03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:26.180]   And your clinical experience, in my mind,
[03:19:26.180 --> 03:19:28.780]   goes along with that.
[03:19:28.780 --> 03:19:31.060]   You know, science, as you said, is very reductionist, right?
[03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:33.020]   But people in two groups, one prays, one doesn't.
[03:19:33.020 --> 03:19:35.540]   You know, that's sort of, that's the way science is done.
[03:19:35.540 --> 03:19:36.380]   Of course.
[03:19:36.380 --> 03:19:40.140]   But ultimately, the real world clinical implications
[03:19:40.140 --> 03:19:43.780]   are what really resonate.
[03:19:43.780 --> 03:19:44.940]   So thank you.
[03:19:44.940 --> 03:19:45.780]   Absolutely.
[03:19:45.780 --> 03:19:46.860]   Thank you for that.
[03:19:46.860 --> 03:19:48.220]   I have one final question.
[03:19:48.220 --> 03:19:49.060]   Yeah.
[03:19:49.060 --> 03:19:49.880]   And it might get you in trouble.
[03:19:49.880 --> 03:19:50.720]   Okay.
[03:19:50.720 --> 03:19:51.560]   But I'm going to ask anyway.
[03:19:51.560 --> 03:19:55.260]   Let's say I or someone that I care about
[03:19:55.260 --> 03:19:57.060]   is admitted to the hospital.
[03:19:57.060 --> 03:20:00.660]   What are the things to do or ask that we're not told
[03:20:00.660 --> 03:20:05.220]   that can facilitate better care that are within bounds?
[03:20:05.220 --> 03:20:07.820]   Now, I will go on record since these days
[03:20:07.820 --> 03:20:10.540]   I'm in the habit of just kind of saying it all.
[03:20:10.540 --> 03:20:16.580]   I'm aware that families of donors to hospitals
[03:20:16.580 --> 03:20:18.060]   get special care.
[03:20:18.060 --> 03:20:19.580]   This is, I will just tell you there's,
[03:20:19.580 --> 03:20:21.340]   you go to a hospital, there's a code language.
[03:20:21.340 --> 03:20:23.460]   I happen to know it for several hospitals.
[03:20:23.460 --> 03:20:25.380]   There's a code language of,
[03:20:25.380 --> 03:20:27.260]   this is a quote unquote special patient.
[03:20:27.260 --> 03:20:29.940]   This will anger some listeners, but it's true.
[03:20:29.940 --> 03:20:31.180]   This is the way the world works.
[03:20:31.180 --> 03:20:32.860]   Not only some listeners, but some physicians.
[03:20:32.860 --> 03:20:34.140]   Some physicians too, right?
[03:20:34.140 --> 03:20:37.700]   So there's a code language that differs by hospital
[03:20:37.700 --> 03:20:39.420]   and I know it for several hospitals.
[03:20:39.420 --> 03:20:42.340]   And I don't want to get into that.
[03:20:42.340 --> 03:20:46.180]   It's one of the more complicated aspects of medicine
[03:20:46.180 --> 03:20:49.380]   and hospitals as businesses and things like that.
[03:20:49.380 --> 03:20:51.260]   I'm gonna get some angry calls about this.
[03:20:51.260 --> 03:20:53.980]   Now, the point of asking this is that
[03:20:53.980 --> 03:20:56.540]   most people are not donors to hospitals.
[03:20:56.540 --> 03:21:00.860]   They're not going to be flagged as a special patient
[03:21:00.860 --> 03:21:03.020]   that gets the room with the window,
[03:21:03.020 --> 03:21:04.700]   that gets sunlight in the morning,
[03:21:04.700 --> 03:21:07.100]   that gets the room alone without somebody next to them
[03:21:07.100 --> 03:21:11.300]   who's coughing all night and on and on.
[03:21:11.300 --> 03:21:16.040]   So are there specific things that people should mention
[03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:18.780]   or ask for in order to get the best possible care
[03:21:18.780 --> 03:21:20.820]   when admitted to a hospital?
[03:21:20.820 --> 03:21:22.180]   Sorry, I got to put you on the spot.
[03:21:22.180 --> 03:21:23.660]   - No, this is excellent.
[03:21:23.660 --> 03:21:25.160]   This is an excellent question.
[03:21:25.160 --> 03:21:27.940]   Some of the things you can control,
[03:21:27.940 --> 03:21:29.240]   some of the things you can't control.
[03:21:29.240 --> 03:21:31.940]   Getting a bed is just completely out of your controls.
[03:21:31.940 --> 03:21:33.980]   If you're in the emergency room,
[03:21:33.980 --> 03:21:35.740]   you can ask when you're gonna go upstairs,
[03:21:35.740 --> 03:21:37.900]   you're gonna get a bed when there's gonna be a bed.
[03:21:37.900 --> 03:21:40.460]   And sometimes I can't even get patients upstairs.
[03:21:40.460 --> 03:21:41.660]   - And they're triaging, right?
[03:21:41.660 --> 03:21:42.500]   - They're triaging.
[03:21:42.500 --> 03:21:44.260]   - This person's at risk of dying.
[03:21:44.260 --> 03:21:46.000]   This person is miserable.
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:47.140]   - Right.
[03:21:47.140 --> 03:21:49.260]   - And you're less miserable, you're gonna wait.
[03:21:49.260 --> 03:21:50.160]   Is that how it works?
[03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:51.160]   Okay. - Potentially.
[03:21:51.160 --> 03:21:56.080]   I think in terms of where you are in the hospital
[03:21:56.080 --> 03:21:58.400]   and the care that you're going to get,
[03:21:58.400 --> 03:22:01.160]   I believe that the number one thing that you can do
[03:22:01.160 --> 03:22:03.820]   to make sure that you're getting the appropriate care
[03:22:03.820 --> 03:22:06.960]   is to, in as many ways as possible,
[03:22:06.960 --> 03:22:10.720]   communicate to the physician, usually not directly,
[03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:12.960]   that you are familiar with the disease
[03:22:12.960 --> 03:22:14.460]   that the patient is being admitted for
[03:22:14.460 --> 03:22:16.560]   and you're gonna ask some tough questions.
[03:22:16.560 --> 03:22:21.280]   Yelling at the nurse is not gonna help you.
[03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:24.840]   Saying insulting things to the nurse or the doctor
[03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:26.060]   or the staff is not gonna help.
[03:22:26.060 --> 03:22:27.400]   It's gonna make things worse.
[03:22:27.400 --> 03:22:28.740]   I think the number one way,
[03:22:28.740 --> 03:22:31.180]   and I can tell you that in terms of as me as a physician,
[03:22:31.180 --> 03:22:34.700]   if I'm speaking to a patient and we have a family member
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:37.340]   that is asking me intelligent questions about something,
[03:22:37.340 --> 03:22:39.620]   that's gonna put me up on my game.
[03:22:39.620 --> 03:22:41.100]   That's gonna make sure that I know
[03:22:41.100 --> 03:22:42.400]   I'm gonna be ready for rounds
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:44.500]   because you're not gonna be glossing over things.
[03:22:44.500 --> 03:22:45.940]   They're gonna be asking some tough questions.
[03:22:45.940 --> 03:22:47.580]   I gotta know what I'm doing.
[03:22:47.580 --> 03:22:51.640]   And that's kind of what I've been doing
[03:22:51.640 --> 03:22:53.860]   for the last 10 years, 12 years,
[03:22:53.860 --> 03:22:55.660]   in terms of the teaching that I do.
[03:22:55.660 --> 03:22:59.020]   We have a website called MedCram.com
[03:22:59.020 --> 03:23:02.540]   where we put up, if you go to your doctor
[03:23:02.540 --> 03:23:04.520]   and you get a CBC back, right?
[03:23:04.520 --> 03:23:06.460]   How do you interpret that CBC?
[03:23:06.460 --> 03:23:07.740]   - Can you explain CBC to people?
[03:23:07.740 --> 03:23:09.620]   - So CBC is a complete blood count
[03:23:09.620 --> 03:23:11.460]   and it's the blood test that you get back
[03:23:11.460 --> 03:23:12.660]   when you get your blood test.
[03:23:12.660 --> 03:23:14.900]   There's a metabolic panel that you get back.
[03:23:14.900 --> 03:23:17.640]   How do you know what's going on with those things?
[03:23:17.640 --> 03:23:18.620]   What about an EKG?
[03:23:18.620 --> 03:23:20.420]   You have these smart watches
[03:23:20.420 --> 03:23:22.640]   that can actually measure your heart rate.
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:25.500]   How can you interpret what's going on there?
[03:23:25.500 --> 03:23:27.900]   We've put courses together to educate people.
[03:23:27.900 --> 03:23:30.420]   We even have courses on diseases.
[03:23:30.420 --> 03:23:31.660]   Congestive heart failure.
[03:23:31.660 --> 03:23:33.460]   What kind of questions do you need to ask
[03:23:33.460 --> 03:23:34.840]   in congestive heart failure?
[03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:36.380]   What are the things that you need to watch out for?
[03:23:36.380 --> 03:23:37.740]   What are the medicines that could put you on?
[03:23:37.740 --> 03:23:39.980]   What are the side effects of those medicines?
[03:23:39.980 --> 03:23:43.820]   I think if, and you don't have to be that educated actually
[03:23:43.820 --> 03:23:44.780]   or even know that much,
[03:23:44.780 --> 03:23:47.660]   but if you can show that you're asking the right questions
[03:23:47.660 --> 03:23:50.140]   to a physician, they're gonna ask you,
[03:23:50.140 --> 03:23:51.220]   are you in the medical field?
[03:23:51.220 --> 03:23:53.300]   You're like, no, I just know about this disease
[03:23:53.300 --> 03:23:54.180]   and I have these questions
[03:23:54.180 --> 03:23:55.500]   about when are you gonna start to do this?
[03:23:55.500 --> 03:23:56.600]   When are you gonna start to do this?
[03:23:56.600 --> 03:23:57.580]   When is this happening?
[03:23:57.580 --> 03:23:59.100]   And when's the next?
[03:23:59.100 --> 03:24:01.740]   I think that more than anything puts those people
[03:24:01.740 --> 03:24:04.100]   who are taking care of you on alerts
[03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:05.500]   to know that you're intelligent,
[03:24:05.500 --> 03:24:07.340]   you're gonna be asking some questions
[03:24:07.340 --> 03:24:09.460]   and they're gonna need to make sure that they focus on
[03:24:09.460 --> 03:24:11.580]   and answering those questions effectively.
[03:24:11.580 --> 03:24:13.260]   I think that's the number one thing.
[03:24:13.260 --> 03:24:14.100]   I love it.
[03:24:14.100 --> 03:24:15.940]   And thank you for stepping right in the line of fire
[03:24:15.940 --> 03:24:17.740]   with that one and not trying to dodge it.
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:22.220]   So it speaks to the kind of person you are.
[03:24:22.220 --> 03:24:27.220]   It speaks to the spirit behind your work,
[03:24:27.220 --> 03:24:31.380]   which is so clearly in service to helping people.
[03:24:31.380 --> 03:24:32.620]   You know, it's such a cliche thing.
[03:24:32.620 --> 03:24:34.540]   We hear, you know, helping people, I wanna help people,
[03:24:34.540 --> 03:24:36.780]   but it's very clear that you wanna help people.
[03:24:36.780 --> 03:24:37.980]   You do this in your social media,
[03:24:37.980 --> 03:24:41.340]   you do this through your online teaching.
[03:24:41.340 --> 03:24:44.500]   We'll, by the way, provide links to all these sources.
[03:24:44.500 --> 03:24:46.060]   And you're doing this in so many ways.
[03:24:46.060 --> 03:24:48.180]   And of course, in your clinical practice.
[03:24:48.180 --> 03:24:50.940]   And, you know, for all those reasons,
[03:24:50.940 --> 03:24:53.240]   and also for coming here today to take time out
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:57.140]   of your very busy professional and family schedule,
[03:24:57.140 --> 03:24:58.420]   and you have your own self-care, right?
[03:24:58.420 --> 03:24:59.240]   If you're not healthy,
[03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:01.660]   you can't take care of other people's health.
[03:25:01.660 --> 03:25:03.120]   I just wanna say on behalf of myself
[03:25:03.120 --> 03:25:05.220]   and everyone listening and watching, thank you so much.
[03:25:05.220 --> 03:25:07.220]   I learned a ton.
[03:25:07.220 --> 03:25:09.820]   And I know everyone else listening did as well.
[03:25:09.820 --> 03:25:13.740]   It's all actionable in service to basic health
[03:25:13.740 --> 03:25:17.820]   and improving health, and in service to avoiding illness.
[03:25:17.820 --> 03:25:19.700]   Those are not the same thing necessarily,
[03:25:19.700 --> 03:25:21.220]   although they go hand in hand,
[03:25:21.220 --> 03:25:22.780]   and to moving through illness
[03:25:22.780 --> 03:25:25.420]   should one contract an infection.
[03:25:25.420 --> 03:25:29.040]   And, you know, just a treasure trove of knowledge.
[03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:30.740]   So thank you so much.
[03:25:30.740 --> 03:25:32.220]   I'd love to have you back again.
[03:25:32.220 --> 03:25:33.060]   - I would love to come back.
[03:25:33.060 --> 03:25:33.900]   Thanks. - I look forward
[03:25:33.900 --> 03:25:36.540]   to seeing you online, but even more so in person.
[03:25:36.540 --> 03:25:39.600]   So thank you so much, Dr. Shwelt.
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:40.700]   You're a real gem.
[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:42.140]   - Thank you so much.
[03:25:42.140 --> 03:25:43.460]   - Thank you once again for joining me

[03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:08.720]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[03:26:08.720 --> 03:26:10.520]   or guests or topics you'd like me to consider
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:12.140]   for the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[03:26:12.140 --> 03:26:14.580]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:26:14.580 --> 03:26:16.480]   I do read all the comments.
[03:26:16.480 --> 03:26:18.240]   Please also check out the sponsors mentioned
[03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:20.420]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:22.860]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[03:26:22.860 --> 03:26:23.980]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:26:23.980 --> 03:26:25.180]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:26:25.180 --> 03:26:26.800]   It's my very first book.
[03:26:26.800 --> 03:26:28.220]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:26:28.220 --> 03:26:30.340]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:26:30.340 --> 03:26:31.540]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:26:31.540 --> 03:26:32.700]   for more than five years,
[03:26:32.700 --> 03:26:35.020]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:26:35.020 --> 03:26:36.580]   of research and experience.
[03:26:36.580 --> 03:26:39.620]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[03:26:39.620 --> 03:26:42.100]   to exercise, to stress control,
[03:26:42.100 --> 03:26:44.580]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:26:44.580 --> 03:26:47.940]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:26:47.940 --> 03:26:50.020]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:26:50.020 --> 03:26:53.900]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:26:53.900 --> 03:26:56.260]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:26:56.260 --> 03:26:58.060]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:26:58.060 --> 03:26:58.980]   Again, the book is called
[03:26:58.980 --> 03:27:02.440]   "Protocols, An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:27:02.440 --> 03:27:04.500]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:27:04.500 --> 03:27:07.620]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:27:07.620 --> 03:27:10.340]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:27:10.340 --> 03:27:12.540]   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Threads.
[03:27:12.540 --> 03:27:13.740]   And on all those platforms,
[03:27:13.740 --> 03:27:15.820]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:27:15.820 --> 03:27:17.380]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:27:17.380 --> 03:27:18.780]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:27:18.780 --> 03:27:20.820]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:27:20.820 --> 03:27:22.340]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:27:22.340 --> 03:27:25.780]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:27:25.780 --> 03:27:27.100]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[03:27:27.100 --> 03:27:28.700]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:27:28.700 --> 03:27:29.980]   the Neural Network newsletter
[03:27:29.980 --> 03:27:32.020]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[03:27:32.020 --> 03:27:33.380]   that includes podcast summaries,
[03:27:33.380 --> 03:27:35.180]   as well as what we call protocols
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:37.460]   in the form of one to three page PDFs
[03:27:37.460 --> 03:27:39.740]   that cover everything from how to optimize your sleep,
[03:27:39.740 --> 03:27:42.540]   how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[03:27:42.540 --> 03:27:44.300]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[03:27:44.300 --> 03:27:47.380]   that covers cardiovascular training and resistance training.
[03:27:47.380 --> 03:27:49.860]   All of that is available completely zero cost.
[03:27:49.860 --> 03:27:51.580]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:27:51.580 --> 03:27:53.460]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[03:27:53.460 --> 03:27:55.980]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[03:27:55.980 --> 03:27:56.820]   And I should emphasize
[03:27:56.820 --> 03:27:59.540]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:27:59.540 --> 03:28:00.860]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:28:00.860 --> 03:28:03.740]   for today's discussion with Dr. Roger Schwelt.
[03:28:03.740 --> 03:28:05.700]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:28:05.700 --> 03:28:07.820]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:28:07.820 --> 03:28:10.400]   [upbeat music]
[03:28:10.400 --> 03:28:12.980]   (upbeat music)
