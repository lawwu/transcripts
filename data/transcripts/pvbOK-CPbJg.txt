[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   - Brendan writes in to ask this.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.280]   Hello Pastor John, I'm currently an 11th grade junior
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.720]   in high school and on the varsity football team.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.400]   I've been in a dilemma lately
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.140]   that I could use some guidance on.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.840]   I've always been disciplined by my parents
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.880]   about not quitting anything when you make a commitment,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.520]   whether it be sports, a job, et cetera.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.240]   I never have quit anything before,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.240]   but football has consumed so much of my time
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200]   that I haven't had time to spend with God or work on school
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.920]   and my grades in relationship with God
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.800]   are in danger of slipping.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920]   I'm not a quitter, but I also have priorities
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.780]   and plans on being a pastor when I grow up,
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.240]   so the Lord and academics are immensely important now.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.440]   So when is it time to quit football?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.060]   Let's think for a minute about the morality
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.340]   of quitting something that you've begun.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.440]   I think it's very important,
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.080]   especially in this situation,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.300]   to realize that sometimes quitting
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.000]   may signify a weakness of character
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.460]   or a weakness of faith in God's provision.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.480]   And other times, quitting may in fact
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.680]   signify a strength of character
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.200]   and a strength of faith in God.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.760]   And of course, Brendan's parents and Brendan himself
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   are rightly concerned that he never quit anything
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.920]   because of weakness of character
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   or lack of faith in God's positions,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.320]   especially if there has been some kind of promise
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.560]   or commitment, since of course,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.480]   promise-breaking is clearly a sin.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.760]   It's a character flaw.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.740]   It dishonors the God of truth.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.600]   But let's think for a minute about these two kinds of quitting
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.280]   because this may help Brendan sort it out.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.000]   Sometimes quitting signifies a weakness of character
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.060]   and a weakness of faith.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.520]   An activity may be difficult and demanding
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   and we may be lazy and so unwilling
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.280]   to remain in the activity, and so we quit.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.880]   Well, that's a dishonorable way to behave.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.640]   Laziness is never a good reason to quit anything.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.640]   Or the activity may be painful,
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.180]   highly demanding exercises that make us very uncomfortable
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.440]   for two hours in the afternoon.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.280]   And we may be unwilling to deny ourselves
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.900]   the pleasures we could be having in the afternoon,
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.360]   and so we quit.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.820]   And that lack of discipline and self-denial
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.160]   is not a virtue, it's a weakness.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.360]   Or the activity may be boring,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.160]   though it's fruitful,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.600]   but we may be so addicted to lots of stimulation,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.760]   we're simply unwilling to be bored
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.840]   in any period of our lives, and so we quit.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.960]   And that's a sin and a weakness
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.480]   that Brendan's parents would surely
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.840]   want to warn him against.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.280]   Or the activity may be, I'm not very good at it,
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.600]   and so I'm not getting a lot of praise.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.240]   I'm sort of performing in an average acceptable way,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.640]   but not much applause is coming to me,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.240]   and frankly, I very much like to get applause,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.480]   and so I'm gonna quit this activity,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.200]   no matter how useful it is for me or others,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.120]   because I wanna go somewhere where I can get more praise
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.200]   and more applause.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.800]   So it's really plain that Brendan is right,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.360]   his folks are right, quitting is often a sign
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.400]   of weakness and flaws,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.640]   and we should do everything we can not to quit
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.000]   under such circumstances.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.640]   However, this really needs to be said,
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.220]   there are situations where quitting
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.200]   may be the very best thing you can do,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.360]   and may require enormous courage,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.040]   and a high degree of character and faith in God.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   For example, the activity may provide us
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   with lots of notoriety, or fame, or popularity,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.920]   but with no fruitfulness in benefiting the lives
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.960]   of anybody else, quitting this activity
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.720]   would require a great deal of self-denial,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   and humility, and trust that God has a better way for us,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.840]   because we're gonna lose all this popularity
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.680]   if we just drop out and start studying,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.640]   or something hidden and unimpressive.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.840]   Or the activity may involve huge amounts of pleasure,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.200]   very little improvement to our spiritual power,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.720]   or development of our gifts,
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.640]   and so quitting this activity would involve
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   valuing spiritual power, and fruitful exercise of our gifts
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.840]   above short-term physical pleasures,
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.400]   that would be a good, that would be a beautiful thing
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.360]   to quit something under those circumstances.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.360]   Or the activity may be proving lots of money is coming in,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.720]   so you have a job that's just paying like crazy,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.360]   but you find it involves you in some compromised behaviors,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.720]   shady dealings, harsh personnel strategies.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.080]   Well, to walk away from that kind of money
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.820]   would be a biblical virtue,
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.800]   as would put people above money.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   So it's never enough simply to say,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.920]   "Don't be a quitter."
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.680]   It's never enough to say, "Quitters are losers."
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   No, no, no.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.240]   Sometimes losers don't have the courage to quit.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   So Brendan raises the issue,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.400]   well, what if I made a commitment?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.560]   And so here are the two questions I think he should ask.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.860]   Did you, in fact, Brendan, make a promise,
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.800]   or make a commitment to play the entire season?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.040]   Second question, was it perhaps, instead of a promise,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   the kind of intention that both you and the coach knew
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.280]   contained implicit conditions and qualifications?
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.040]   And I would say, to the degree that the commitment to play
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   rises to the level of an unqualified promise,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.140]   to that degree, you finish the season.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.840]   You don't break your promise.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.000]   You find other ways to fight the fight of faith,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.680]   to get near to the Lord, to do your schoolwork,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.260]   but you don't break the promise.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.260]   However, my guess is that even if there was an implicit
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.300]   or explicit promise to play the season,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.300]   a conversation with the coach gives him the right,
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.720]   that is, he has the right and gives him the opportunity
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.980]   to release you from a commitment that you made.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.300]   And that's the conversation I would probably pursue.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.220]   So if your studies are suffering,
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.340]   and your walk with the Lord is drying up
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.260]   because it's not being fed and watered,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.660]   I would say that both of these outweigh
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.940]   the importance of football,
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.280]   and are worth a serious conversation with your coach.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.540]   - That's an outstanding little theology of quitting.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.260]   Well, what is the point of thinking deeply about God?
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.700]   We think deeply about God a lot on this podcast,
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.980]   but what's the point?
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.300]   We have a listener who is trying to convince her friends
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.300]   that they should try to use more thinking
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.500]   in their Bible study to go deeper in what they can discover.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.420]   So how do you convince a non-thinker
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.500]   to think more deeply in their Bible study?
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.920]   John Byber and I will close out the week
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.580]   with this question on the table tomorrow.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.900]   Of course, you can keep up with all of our episodes
