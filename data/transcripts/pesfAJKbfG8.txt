[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.960]   This week we welcome author and speaker,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.620]   Dr. Paul David Tripp.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.400]   Paul will be filling in this week.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.840]   And most recently, Paul is the author of the book,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.840]   "Awe, Why It Matters for Everything We Think, Say, and Do."
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.120]   A book that easily made my top 10 list
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.700]   for the best books of 2015.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.120]   And this week we're gonna be talking about
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.780]   awe in the awesome glory of God.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.500]   And how this awe in God really does relate
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.660]   to everything in life,
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.860]   specifically to our spiritual growth, our Bible intake,
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.160]   our ministry aims, and even to our news consumption,
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.600]   our anxieties, our weight loss attempts,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.900]   our parenting methods,
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.500]   and our expectations of marriage and romantic love.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.180]   All of those are topics for us this week,
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.260]   and it'll be a full week, so let's dive in.
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.060]   Paul, in the book you wrote this,
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.060]   "Spiritual growth is about recapturing your awe."
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.980]   I wanna read that again.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.980]   "Spiritual growth is about recapturing your awe."
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.180]   That is a great line.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.540]   Envision us here, how does spiritual growth
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.780]   in the Christian life work dynamically?
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.020]   - Well, I think the first thing that you need to understand
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.020]   is that God hardwired all human beings for awe.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.160]   There is a quest inside of us to be amazed,
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.300]   to wonder, to have something that is so great
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.980]   and so awesome and so compelling that we want to live for,
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.420]   that we're willing to make sacrifices for,
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.580]   that it will be the thing that will get us up in the morning.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.620]   That's all of humanity.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.620]   So being connected to God through Jesus Christ
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.300]   is essentially being given back my awe again,
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.380]   because what happens in sin is that awe of God
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.020]   is replaced by awe of other things.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.380]   Most centrally, awe of myself.
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.420]   So that's what's captured in Corinthians 5.15,
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.100]   that says, "Jesus came so that those who live,"
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.740]   very interesting terminology,
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.560]   "would no longer live for themselves."
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.660]   So you could argue that Christian growth
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.340]   is a growth in my awe of God,
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.100]   that the thing that dominates me more and more
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.180]   is the wonder of God
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.380]   and the wonder of my attachment to God by grace.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.860]   So you could ask me,
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.460]   "Why do you treat your wife the way you do?"
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.900]   I could say, "Because of my awe of God."
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.420]   "Why do you parent your children the way you do?"
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.740]   "Because of my awe of God."
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.220]   "Why do you spend your money the way you do?"
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.100]   "Because of my awe of God."
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.060]   - Yeah, this is all-encompassing.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.860]   So this is really fundamental to what it means
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.340]   to be a creature made in God's image.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.180]   - That's right.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.180]   - And that's why I think that it's sad
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.660]   that this kind of language has been lost by the church.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.740]   People almost, with a bit of wonderment, say,
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.940]   "Why would you ever want to write a book on awe?"
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.020]   And it's because it's not familiar, intuitive language,
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.340]   even to believers.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.220]   And the heart of spirituality
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.340]   is living in wonder of the divine.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.100]   - Okay, so let's get practical.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.180]   What should a Christian be looking for
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.420]   in the pages of their Bible?
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.260]   - Glory.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.100]   Glory.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.260]   You know, if every day I'm not beckoned, wooed,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.620]   if I could use this term in a positive sense,
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.340]   seduced by the glory of God,
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.140]   I will be wooed and tempted and seduced
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.900]   by something else.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.620]   And literally, the thing that splashes
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.580]   across every page of the Word of God
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.980]   is the magnificent glory of God.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.940]   The scriptures are meant not just to be
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.980]   a sort of logistical wisdom book
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.340]   that helps us to live a better life.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.340]   The scriptures are meant to finally point us
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.580]   to that one place where our hearts can rest
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.180]   and be satisfied because we're exposed to wonder
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.060]   that's unlike any wonder we've ever known before.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.220]   - Yes, so our lives are either captured
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.820]   by the majesty of God,
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.140]   or they will be captured by the fears of life, really.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.020]   Fears of failure, fears of inadequacy,
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.500]   fears of the future.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.820]   How does awe in God confront our fears?
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.740]   - I've actually felt that this book
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.940]   that's come out at this time
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.900]   where we're all shocked by Paris
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.780]   and shocked by San Bernardino
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.180]   and shocked by millions of Syrian refugees
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.780]   that have no place to live
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.900]   and are risking death to find a new home,
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.880]   when it seems like the world's at fire,
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.280]   that this book has come out.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.580]   And here's why I think that.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.580]   It's that, it's an understanding that fear,
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.460]   horizontal fear, whether that's fear of acceptance
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.580]   or fear of my physical health
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.740]   or fear of a loss of a job or fear of terrorism,
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.220]   fear is only ever disarmed by fear.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.620]   It's only the fear of something greater
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.140]   that disarms the fear of something lesser.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.180]   You know where you see that?
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.740]   You see that in that great moment
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.620]   when Israel is in the Valley of Elah
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.420]   and they're facing the Philistine army
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.420]   and out that first day comes the great warrior Goliath
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.460]   and says, "Send me your best."
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.460]   And what the army of Israel does
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.100]   is they retreat back in their tents
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.440]   for 40 days and commiserate.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.300]   Now there's an army that doesn't have a military problem.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.500]   They're in fear because they have an awe problem.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   They're in the tents fearing because they're all amnesiacs
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.340]   because the God who delivered that promised land to them
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.340]   said, "I will deliver these nations into your hands.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.460]   I am the Lord Almighty."
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.060]   David shows up and David doesn't have that awe problem
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.940]   because David says he delivered the lion
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.380]   and he delivered the bear
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.420]   and he will deliver this Philistine this day.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.820]   And so David is willing to march into that valley
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.580]   with a silly shepherd's sling and five stones
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.300]   because it's the fear of God
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.820]   that disarms his fear of this giant warrior.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.460]   That's how it operates.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.780]   It's when my heart is so filled and satisfied
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.580]   with that reverential fear of God
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.900]   that I am not then able to be captured
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.560]   by all the horizontal fears of life in a fallen world.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.160]   - Yeah, that's so good.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.860]   So our awe in God, which includes a fear of God,
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.180]   must dwarf the loudest news cycle.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.020]   - Absolutely.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.900]   And I wanna just express this concern.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.380]   I think more than ever before,
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.700]   Christians are news junkies more than ever before
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.700]   through social media and websites and 24-hour news cycle,
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.900]   we are aware of what's happening around us.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.660]   And I think for many of us, that has been the rise of fear.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.140]   And maybe more than ever before,
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.780]   we need to quietly meditate,
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.100]   gaze upon the glory of the Lord
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.020]   so that we do not give way to fear.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.740]   - Yeah, we must be seduced by God, to use your phrase.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.580]   That is so good.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.660]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.620]   We are gonna return tomorrow
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.860]   and transition to talking about awe
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.140]   and the spiritual battle of weight loss,
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.700]   something you have faced squarely, I know.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.660]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.780]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.300]   with guest Paul Tripp.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.420]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.580]   (upbeat music)
