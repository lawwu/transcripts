[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Well, happy Christmas Eve, everyone.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.120]   Thank you for joining us on the podcast.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.760]   Pastor John, last time in the last episode,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.280]   I shared a clip from you preaching
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.720]   on Christmas of 1981, 40 years ago,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.080]   at the youthful age of just 35.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320]   A clip that's older than you were when you preached.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.720]   It's amazing to hear your voice
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.140]   as a rookie pastor back then,
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.200]   but we're now zoomed into real time here in the studio.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.140]   You are 75 now, and Christmas 2021 is tomorrow.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.160]   For a lot of Christmases,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.000]   you've been thinking about the implications
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.320]   of Christ's coming, but particularly this year.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.580]   I know you've been giving a lot of thought
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.880]   to the holiday over these past several weeks
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.180]   leading up to Christmas.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.180]   Tell us why and what's on your mind on this Christmas Eve.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.520]   - Tony, I learned back in October
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.040]   that I'd be preaching at my own church at Bethlehem
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.280]   the Sunday before Christmas, last Sunday.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.320]   From that time in October until now,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   the wonder of Christmas that has taken hold of me
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   in a fresh and powerful way is the amazing reality
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.720]   that the personal, infinite, eternal,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.720]   holy creator of the universe
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.320]   sent his son into this tiny speck
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.320]   of human habitation called earth
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.320]   in order to be condemned to death in my place.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.760]   Sometimes we just have to do what Psalm 46 says,
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.960]   namely, be still and know that I am God.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.760]   In other words, we have to just pause
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.960]   and let staggering reality sink in.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.680]   Christmas Eve is a really good time, I think, to do this.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.680]   So what reality do we need to let sink in today?
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.600]   Reality like this, before and above
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.200]   and outside of all created reality,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920]   outside of the entire scope of the universe
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.280]   with its countless light years of expanse,
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   outside of all that, there is and there always has been
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.920]   a personal, infinite, eternal, holy God.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.480]   He is absolute reality.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.760]   He is the most real, real.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.640]   The most ultimate thing he ever said was,
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.680]   "I am who I am."
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.120]   He is simply there.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.200]   He's there, like Francis Schaeffer said.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   The God who is there, above, before, outside all reality.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.600]   Think of it, eternal reality could have been a gas.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.200]   Nothing existed before the original reality
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.680]   to make it what it was.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.360]   It just was.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.960]   Only we discover it's not an it.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.400]   It's not an it.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   Ultimate reality is a person.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.240]   It's just mind-boggling.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.120]   I am who I am.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.040]   We don't create him.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.520]   We don't define him.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.880]   We don't counsel him or help or enrich him
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.040]   or initiate anything with him.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.400]   He is who he is and he reveals himself.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.200]   Long ago and in many and various ways,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.000]   God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   but in these last days, he has spoken to us by a son.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.880]   Hebrews 1, 1 and 2.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.400]   We must be still today, it seems to me.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.720]   I must be still and let this sink in.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.720]   From all eternity, the infinite, eternal, personal,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.780]   holy creator has existed as father and son and Holy Spirit.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.200]   Now, what could that possibly mean?
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   Son, son, God has always had a son.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.640]   These are mysteries that make Christmas breathtaking.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.140]   God has a son.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.680]   He has had a son forever.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.400]   The son never came into being.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.000]   He is not created.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.760]   There never was a time in the infinite eternity past
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.480]   when he did not exist.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.440]   The apostle John comes to help us as our mouths
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.760]   are agape with astonishment.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   He comes and he says, "In the beginning was the word
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   "and the word was with God and the word was God."
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.320]   The word was with God and the word was God.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.200]   So God was with God.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.420]   Yes, God was with God.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.980]   And the God who was with God, the word,
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.440]   was the son of God.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   Verse 14, "And the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.000]   "and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only son
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.440]   "from the father, full of grace and truth."
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.160]   And we mark that moment.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   We mark that moment when God sent God into the world.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.220]   We mark it with a celebration called Christmas.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.200]   One day a year to be still and know that from all eternity,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.220]   God had a perfect image of himself,
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.640]   a perfect radiance of his glory,
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.700]   a perfect essence of his nature.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.360]   And this God who was with God was the word
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.560]   and was the son.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.960]   And when the time was perfect, Paul says,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.640]   when the time was full and perfect
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.720]   to accomplish all God's eternal purposes for humanity,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.500]   God sent God, the word, the son,
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.800]   to this tiny speck of human habitation called earth
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.820]   and the foundations of Christmas were laid.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.740]   Now the question is why?
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.580]   Why?
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.180]   And the answer God himself gives
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.180]   and that I have been so sweetly captivated by
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.100]   since October is Romans 8, 3.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.260]   God has done what the law weakened by the flesh
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.340]   could not do by sending his own son.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.900]   That's Christmas.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.660]   Romans 8, 3, Christmas.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.480]   By sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.200]   and for sin, and here it comes,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   he condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   God sent God as the God man.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.740]   The flesh God to be condemned in his mortal flesh.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.520]   And the one who condemned God was God.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   God condemned sin in the death of the God man, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.700]   Whose sin?
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.800]   Jesus didn't have any.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.580]   Jesus was the one person in the world
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.980]   who didn't deserve to be condemned.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.200]   The rest of us did.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.260]   John Piper has accumulated almost 76 years of sins.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:24.060]   Thousands upon thousands of sins.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:30.380]   Any one of which was offensive enough against a holy God
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.740]   to plunge me into eternal ruin.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.740]   I don't stand a chance on my own
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.180]   to be acquitted before a God of justice.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.180]   I am under condemnation, condemnation, and justly so.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.280]   The righteous law of God that I have broken
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.260]   hangs over my head like a curse.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.880]   What hope is there then for me?
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.660]   In a very short time, John Piper, age 75 now,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.020]   will stand before God to give an account of his life.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.300]   So what hope do I have?
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.580]   Be still and know the meaning of Christmas.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.180]   God has done what the law,
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.540]   hanging over me like a curse, could not do.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.300]   The law can't pay for my breaking the law.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.060]   So what did God plan to do from all eternity?
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.060]   God planned to send God, the Son, the God man,
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.540]   so that in his mortal flesh,
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.280]   without any sins of his own at all,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.360]   he might bear the condemnation I deserve.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.100]   By sending his own Son for sin,
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.360]   he condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.800]   Or as Paul says in Galatians 3.13,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Christ became a curse for John Piper.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.500]   So what does Christmas feel like for me?
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.860]   It feels like a man standing on the gallows
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.480]   with the rope around his neck,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.740]   and the King's Son steps forward,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.860]   takes the rope off my neck, puts it on his own,
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.560]   looks me in the eye,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.900]   and just before he drops to his own death in my place,
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.900]   he says, "I love you.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.920]   "I love you.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.300]   "Go show what I'm like now to the world."
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   What does Christmas feel like to me?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.020]   It feels like a man drowning in the icy Atlantic
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.160]   after the sinking of the Titanic,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.000]   desperate to be taken into a lifeboat, but being refused.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.840]   Why?
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.240]   There's no room in the lifeboat.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.220]   It's full.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.060]   And a man, the wealthiest, healthiest,
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.700]   most influential man on that ship,
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.700]   pulls me in as he jumps overboard to make room for me
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:11.460]   and looks up as I float away in safety and says,
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.420]   "I love you."
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.380]   What does Christmas feel like for me?
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.740]   It feels like a courtroom where your life,
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.140]   my life, hangs in the balance.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.860]   The prosecuting attorney is the unassailable law of God.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.060]   The defense attorney does not exist.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.020]   There is no defense.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.780]   It is manifest to everyone in the courtroom
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.980]   that all evidence is against me.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.520]   And the judge, the son of the king of the realm,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.660]   brings down the gavel, guilty,
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.300]   sentenced to execution, everlasting ruin.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.100]   And as they leave the courtroom with me in bonds,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.880]   the judge follows me out, pulls me aside and says,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.420]   "I'm gonna take your condemnation.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   "You go now and show the wonder of this moment to the world.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.980]   "I love you."
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:04.820]   So, Tony, that's where I've been now these months
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.380]   leading to this moment on Christmas Eve.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.380]   Romans 8, 3, "God has done what the law could not do
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.860]   "by sending his own son, Christmas,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.740]   "in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:26.740]   "and for sin he condemned sin, my sin,
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.260]   "in the flesh."
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.260]   What Christmas stands for is infinitely precious.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.220]   It is.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.940]   And I would simply plead with all our listeners,
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.500]   come to Jesus Christ this Christmas.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.340]   If you will embrace Jesus Christ,
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.860]   the son of God as your precious savior,
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.920]   all that God is for you,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.860]   all that God is for you in Christ, in him,
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.040]   will be yours, no condemnation ever.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   And it will be a very Merry Christmas.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.180]   - Amen.
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.320]   Infinitely precious.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   That's no overstatement.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.320]   Well, on behalf of John Piper and the Desiring God staff
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.160]   in Minneapolis and around the country and around the world,
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.520]   we would all like to wish you a very Merry Christmas
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.140]   and a Christ-filled Christmas weekend,
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.400]   relishing in all of these glories
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.280]   that we talked about today.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.560]   I am Tony Reike, and we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
