[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820]   How can I be freed from my obsession with my appearance?
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.260]   It's an ever-important question and it comes in today from an anonymous young woman who
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.000]   listens to every episode of this podcast and no doubt is listening right now.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I am 19 years old.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.100]   I've been listening to your podcast for a few years now and it is, well, a little embarrassing
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.380]   how much I binge your episodes, but they have helped me so much.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.380]   Thank you.
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.080]   I have a question that I have been wrestling with for a while about self-image.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.620]   For years now I have dealt with hating what I see in the mirror.
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.620]   It's been a frustrating and emotional journey.
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.760]   I struggle with a lot of self-comparison and am very critical of my own appearance.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.800]   I get very self-conscious when I'm not wearing makeup or when I wear certain clothes.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.440]   I know this is a huge problem for young women.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.420]   Women need Jesus to forgive their sins, not to make them feel beautiful, and yet knowing
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.500]   that I still struggle here.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.640]   I know that this is a branch of pride and self-love to be so caught up in appearance.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.160]   It's very damaging and discouraging and it affects my daily life.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.060]   I was wondering how you would biblically encourage women who struggle with the same thing."
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.700]   Let me begin with a story.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:27.140]   Evelyn Brand was born in England in 1879 and grew up in a well-to-do British family.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.700]   She studied at the London Conservatory of Art and she dressed in the finest silks of
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.360]   the day.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.820]   She was resoundingly converted to Christ, married, and went with her husband to minister
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.020]   as missionaries in the Kohli Malai mountain range in India.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.180]   After about 10 years, her husband died at the age of 44 and she came home broken, beaten
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.020]   down by pain and grief.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.940]   But after a year's restoration and against all advice, she returned all by herself to
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.540]   India.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.100]   Her soul was restored.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.700]   She poured her life into the hill people, nursing the sick, teaching farming, lecturing
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.140]   about guinea worms, rearing orphans, clearing jungle land, pulling teeth, establishing
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.920]   schools, spreading the gospel.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.840]   She lived in a portable hut, eight feet square for a season, that could be taken down and
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.220]   moved and then put up again.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.380]   At age 67, she fell and broke her hip.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.340]   Her son Paul, famous surgeon, Paul Brand, her son Paul, encouraged her to retire.
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.900]   She had already suffered a broken arm, several cracked vertebrae, recurrent malaria.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540]   Her response?
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.860]   "Paul, you know these mountains.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.420]   If I leave, who will help the village people?
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.100]   Who will treat their wounds and pull their teeth and teach them about Jesus?
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.700]   When someone comes to take my place, then, and only then, will I retire."
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:26.460]   So she worked on, and then almost 30 years later, 67, 30 years later, at the age of 95,
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.900]   she died.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.220]   The villagers buried her in a simple cotton sheet so that she would decompose and be part
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.380]   of the mountains.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.220]   Her son commented that, "With wrinkles as deep and extensive as any I have ever seen
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.100]   on a human face, she was a beautiful woman."
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.740]   Now, here's the great part.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:59.220]   For the last 20 years of her life, she refused to have a mirror in her house.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.520]   I love this.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.860]   She was consumed with ministry, not mirrors, not self.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.860]   A co-worker once remarked that Granny Brand was more alive than any person he had ever
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.060]   met.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:27.940]   Now, the world is spending billions of dollars and endless media time to persuade women that
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.800]   life consists in their looks, their skin, their shape, their hair.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.460]   The scam is as old as history.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.500]   At the center of it is the attempt to trick women into the habit of comparing themselves
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.220]   with other women, even though Paul wrote, "When they measure themselves by one another
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.520]   and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding."
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.800]   That's referring to another situation, but the principle is still the same.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.240]   Second Corinthians 10.12.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.660]   Three thousand years ago, the Old Testament wise men pleaded with women not to be tricked.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.660]   He said, "Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.900]   to be praised."
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   Proverbs 31.30.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:28.820]   In other words, true beauty, the real praiseworthiness in life, is not outward appearance but reverence
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.580]   for God and a life lived for others.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.280]   Two thousand years ago, the apostle Peter said, "Do not let your adorning be external,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.980]   the braiding of hair, the putting on of gold jewelry, the clothing that you wear, but let
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.000]   your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.720]   and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.840]   And Paul said, "Let women adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.380]   not with braided hair and gold and pearls and costly attire, but with what is proper
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.200]   for women who profess godliness, namely, with good works."
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.680]   In other words, true beauty is a life lived in the service of others.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:26.060]   The greatest beauty is a life of self-forgetfulness for the good of others in the name of Jesus.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:33.320]   And let me throw in a little personal aside that will encourage a few thousand women and
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.080]   offend a few million, maybe.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.760]   I don't speak for all men, but I do speak for, I don't know, a few thousand, when I
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.880]   say we don't find makeup attractive.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:53.900]   Lipstick, eye shadow, facial colors, nail coloring, they're off-putting.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.880]   We love natural, authentic faces.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.720]   Now if that sounds liberating to you, I'm glad.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.280]   If it doesn't, if it's offensive, threatening, annoying, well, don't worry.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.960]   It's just John Piper's weird opinion, and there are a lot of godly people who would
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   disagree with me.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.360]   In fact, more godly than I am, I am sure.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.240]   And it's not the main point of this asbestos, John, so end that little tirade and back to
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   the point.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.560]   So what is the main point?
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:30.860]   The main point is that outward beauty is insignificant compared to inward beauty of humility and
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.040]   wisdom and love, a life lived for others.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:42.320]   And believe it or not, not only God, but the world sees this at its common grace best.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:50.840]   How many millions of people would say that Mother Teresa, old, wrinkled Mother Teresa,
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:59.440]   had a beauty more powerful than all the models of the world put together?
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.540]   Just like Evelyn Brand, who refused to have mirrors in her house for the last 20 years
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.540]   of her life.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.180]   Let me end with another story.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.400]   A long time ago in our neighborhood, a man appeared for a short time.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.160]   I don't know where he came from or where he went.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160]   He was only here a short time, as far as I could tell.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:28.300]   And I noticed that he only came out of the subsidized high-rise near our house at evening.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.560]   And he would generally be on the other side of the street from wherever people were.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.860]   And I caught a glimpse of him one evening while I was out with the dog and noticed a
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:44.280]   massive purple birthmark covering most of his face.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.740]   There was not only discoloring, there was disfiguring.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.400]   I mean, he would have frightened virtually any child that saw him and probably caused
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.560]   most people to cross the street.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.200]   So one evening I timed my walk to meet him.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.760]   And as we passed, I greeted him and asked if I could say a word to him.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.880]   This is hugely risky, what I'm about to do.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.420]   Don't necessarily recommend it, but it's just what I felt led to do.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.600]   He stopped and I just cut straight to the chase.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.460]   I said, "My name is John.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.280]   I live down the street over there at that red house.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.040]   And I'm a pastor at the church over there.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:34.880]   And I just want you to know that I know you're here and I don't want to avoid you.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.440]   And I realize life must be hard for you.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:45.540]   But I want you to know two things that are true because of Jesus.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:51.080]   One is that I care about you and am not put off by your looks."
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.680]   You can see why this is risky, right?
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.240]   I mean, just no idea whether this is going to make him angry or not.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.320]   And the other is I have spectacular news for people with every kind of disability.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.520]   Namely, everyone who trusts in Jesus will be completely healed in the resurrection.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:16.820]   And we will have brand new bodies, new faces, new legs, new arms, but we'll still be ourselves.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.960]   He actually thanked me and then went on his way.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   I don't think I ever saw him again.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.040]   The reason I tell that story is this.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.600]   Virtually all of us are way too wrapped up in our relatively minor problems.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:43.160]   That man's face puts my concern with wrinkles and sagging and blotching in a proper light.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:51.080]   What we all need is a good dose of exposure to real suffering, which we have not yet known,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:57.700]   and perhaps a few decades of glorious service in the mountains of India with no mirrors
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.700]   in our house.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   Wow.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.700]   Amazing stories.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.120]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for sending in the important and honest question
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.840]   like this one.
