[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   If you're new to the Radical Personal Finance podcast, only been listening for a couple
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.520]   of weeks, you may be under the impression that this is an interview show.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:28.440]   Well, today, I'm pleased to disabuse you of that notion because Friday Q&A is back.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:40.120]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520]   Thank you so much for being with me.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520]   I'm back.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.520]   I'm back.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   I'm back.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   I'm back.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   Sitting in front of a microphone, kind of off my game a little bit.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.600]   Doesn't feel so smooth, but man, is it good to be back.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600]   Been too long.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.960]   Too many interviews.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.640]   Let's get to some Q&A.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.280]   Let's get back to the show the way I've envisioned it.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.400]   And I thank you for your patience.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.920]   September was busy and challenging and stretching in many, many ways.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.760]   One of the more challenging months of my life, but we're making progress.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.720]   Got back safely from FinCon up in Charlotte and really been able to make a lot of progress
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   around the house last couple of weeks.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.000]   My little girl is doing a lot better, so that really makes a huge difference.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.480]   I spend all day holding a crying little baby, and so we're thankful that she's doing better
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   and things are looking up.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.320]   Making a lot of progress on the show.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.840]   Lots of changes around here.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.080]   As you heard yesterday, we launched our first sponsor, YNAB.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.880]   We're going to be launching a total of 10 sponsors over this month, and I'll talk a
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.320]   little bit about that, yes, in one of the questions today.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.120]   I'll mention a few more details on the sponsorship program.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.760]   But I want to thank you all for your patience over the last month.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.480]   I have been making progress all around to be able to free things up, free up my schedule
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.200]   to really improve Radical Personal Finance and really deepen the content, keep it more
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.040]   varied and more interesting, and also flesh out some of the things that need to really
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   be developed.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.320]   Some of the courses I'm working on, I'm working on writing the book, getting that
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   done here.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.280]   So, lots of work all around, but today I am thrilled to get back to the podcast.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.680]   I'm going to clear out the voicemail box today, and I've got a bunch of questions
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   lined up.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.760]   I think it looks like about six.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.040]   These are going to be fairly simple, fairly light questions.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.200]   No heavy financial planning lifting today.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.000]   I wasn't able to get into that.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.480]   I've got email boxes full of questions of your heavy financial questions, and maybe
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.400]   next week we'll try to dig into some of the real meat there.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.880]   But you've got to ease me back in slowly, little by little.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.400]   So today I'm going to do some fairly light questions.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.680]   I also intend to be moving pretty fast today, and long-time listeners are rolling their
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.160]   eyes, but I really do mean it.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.560]   I plan to move pretty fast.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.240]   So let's see how we go.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.240]   First question comes from Richard.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.680]   Hi Josh, this is Richard.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.000]   I really appreciate your podcast and I'm learning a lot from listening to it.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   My wife and I have local bank accounts that we pay our bills out of.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.360]   We're thinking of setting up a joint account with an online bank that we pay all our bills
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.040]   out of, and I'm particularly interested if you have any recommendations in this area.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.180]   I'm looking for a bank that might have features that allow rainy day funds to be set up so
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.800]   that a certain amount of money each month is set into a rainy day fund, or a refrigerator
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.080]   fund, or a new car fund, or a vacation fund, or a gift fund, or any other little accounts
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.160]   that we might set up to automatically save more money for future big expenses.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.920]   Again, appreciate your show and I'm curious to know if you have any recommendations.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920]   Thanks.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.960]   Richard, the name you're looking for is Capital1360.com.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.320]   To the best of my knowledge, they are the powerhouse in this area.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   Capital1360.com.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.120]   This used to be a pretty revolutionary concept, and I used to bank with an online bank called
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.960]   ING Direct.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.760]   And ING Direct, they had a cute little orange branding and a cute little orange ball and
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   all that.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   And they really pioneered this space by my memory.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   I'm sure there are competitors that were also involved, but they were the ones that seemed
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.400]   to be everywhere.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.680]   And they really did a good job of establishing the online bank account with as many accounts
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   as you want.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.600]   So you could have 20, I think 25 accounts if memory serves correctly.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.640]   And they really did a good job.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.080]   And I used to bank with ING Direct.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080]   I banked with them.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   My wife banked with them.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.480]   After we were married, I think we – yeah.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.000]   After we were married, we still banked with them.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.200]   But then they were acquired by Capital One, bought out.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.400]   They changed their branding from ING Direct to Capital 1360.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.200]   And so they're still a very large bank.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.760]   They still do lots of business.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.320]   All of those same features apply where you can set up as many accounts.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.360]   There's no cost to them as possible.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.520]   I don't bank with them anymore because I – and I closed my accounts after Capital
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.960]   One bought them because I didn't want to do business with Capital One.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.440]   Generally, I'm not a fan of any of the large financial services companies in the United
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   States.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.800]   I can't stand any of the banks.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.880]   And so I do my best not to work with them as much as I can avoid it.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.080]   I don't like the stranglehold that they have over the political economy.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.760]   I don't like how they basically control the government.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.880]   I don't like a lot of their business practices.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.960]   But that's just my own personal thing.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.280]   That doesn't need to affect you.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.040]   They do a perfectly fine job as far as customer service.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.560]   I've never heard any major complaints.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.880]   So Capital1360.com is the website that you want to do and check them out.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.160]   I'm sure there are competitors.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.680]   Just do an internet search and see what other competitors are.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.640]   But they are definitely the big one in that space.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   If that works for you, setting up all the different accounts and automating it, that
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   can work well.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   I have done that.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.960]   I do think – and in fact, I thought this was a good segue into sponsor of the day number
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.160]   one, which is YNAB, who we introduced yesterday.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   I do think that a system of managing one account and having something that's not separate
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.040]   bank accounts can be really, really good.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.600]   So at this point, I used to do the – personally, I used to do the many, many accounts type
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   of system.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.560]   Now, I'm down to just two accounts, savings account and a checking account.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.240]   And with YNAB, it makes it easy.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.600]   I used to keep a spreadsheet as well.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.920]   You can just keep a spreadsheet and say, "OK, if I've got – let's say I've
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.840]   got $5,000 in this account.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.320]   Of the $5,000, how is it allocated?"
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.480]   Now that I'm using YNAB, I'm able to do the same thing.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.560]   You can just simply budget the money into the account.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.920]   So if you're saving for a new refrigerator, you can save for that consistently over time
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.080]   and you can set that aside.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.880]   Now you know there's where the money is.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.680]   And what the reason – the danger of just doing multiple accounts is that you might
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.400]   not have any kind of system of accounting.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.240]   And the challenge is – from doing multiple accounts is doing bookkeeping.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   And so if it's just all for savings, then that works fine.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.880]   But what I've done and what I've seen people do is using the different accounts to save
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.840]   for things like car insurance.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.880]   Well, car insurance is not a big picture – excuse me, a big purchase.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.720]   It's a budgeted item.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   And yes, it's simple enough to have a different account and put the money in every month so
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.880]   that you have it there after six months.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.040]   But what happens is it's much harder to have any kind of system of reports where basically
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.840]   you're just looking at that account and saying, "Is there money there?"
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.120]   Because when you get into tracking six different bank accounts or eight different bank accounts,
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.560]   it's going to make it very challenging to manage all those transactions.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.500]   And what happens if you're using Quicken or using a spreadsheet, you basically always
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.440]   are having balance transfers everywhere.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.800]   So I don't think it's necessarily an optimal system.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.880]   Although if it works for you, go with it.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.480]   I used to do it and who knows?
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.360]   Maybe I'll do it again in five years and I'll switch everything up.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.220]   But that's what I don't like about that approach is it's hard to track.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.400]   So check out – if you haven't tried YNAB, you heard the interview yesterday.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.000]   And again, they're sponsored the day, number one today.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.120]   It's a budgeting software and it is absolutely the best budgeting software that I have ever
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.120]   found.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.760]   And I think that each and every one – it's – at this point in time, every financial
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.880]   client that I work with from now going forward, the very first step is going to be budgeting
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.840]   because it allows you to proactively set that money aside and it simply solves your issue
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.680]   without having to have multiple accounts.

[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   Kick it off, Rick.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.400]   This is Rick in California.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.280]   In episode 204, you asked Todd if he knew of any insurance companies that do not pay
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.560]   a commission and there are at least two that I'm aware of.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.680]   One is Ameritask Direct has a no-load life insurance as well as annuity product.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.560]   And then also Tia Kref who I would say is probably the leader in that particular space
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.760]   also has a no-load life insurance solution.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.560]   And I believe there's at least one or two others as well.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   You're right.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.200]   There are definitely a few and far between.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.840]   But I thought I'd pass that along.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   Take care.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.400]   Rick, thanks for the tip.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.960]   Tia Kref definitely is a unique scenario.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.640]   They're a powerhouse and they have great life insurance products and they do a very good
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   job.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.320]   I guess I was aware of Tia Kref.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.880]   I wasn't aware of Ameritask Direct.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.720]   So I went and looked up their website.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   It's AmeritaskDirect.com if anyone else is interested.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.280]   And yeah, their advertisement right here at the top of the page is Ameritask Advisor Services,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.680]   the no-load insurance pioneer.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:27.120]   So they're out there on the lonely vanguard of offering no-commission insurance products.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.120]   And I think they're a good option.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.520]   Again, I don't know anything about them.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.480]   I'm only concerned with a company like this.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.800]   I've never heard of them.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.880]   And so the challenge is even for an advisor is you've got to make sure that your client
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.320]   is going to be served by the best product.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.640]   And with insurance, there are very much economies of scale.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.480]   There's very much financial strength.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.000]   There's a place of financial strength that really matters.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.680]   And so this would be my biggest concern.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.720]   I don't believe personally – maybe I'll change my mind in the future – but I don't
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:07.280]   believe that the payment of a commission on a life insurance policy is the indicator of
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.640]   whether or not that policy was well-built.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.400]   I think there's a lot more that matters in addition to the commission.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   So as an example, I just clicked over here to the ratings.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.040]   And so Meritas, they advertise two ratings, one with AM Best for an A rating and then
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.840]   their Standard & Poor's rating with an A+ rating.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.720]   Now the first concern is they don't subscribe to the other two of the ratings agencies,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.760]   which are Fitch and Moody's.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.080]   And there's nothing wrong with an A rating.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:43.000]   But if you were to compare that, an A rating with AM Best is the third highest of the best
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.760]   ratings and an A+ with Standard & Poor's is the fifth highest of S&P's ratings.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:56.120]   So compare that to some of the AAA-rated companies that are just AAA-rated across the board,
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.960]   Northwestern Mutual, New York Life, MassMutual.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.160]   They probably, depending on what year, sometimes there's one of the four or two of the four
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.360]   for which they're not AAA across the board, the very highest with those three companies.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.680]   But there's a very large difference in ratings.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.880]   There's a good difference there in ratings.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   And the bigger ones, there's a massive difference in terms of the economy, the scale of the
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880]   company.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.040]   So if you were to compare the balance sheet of any of those companies to the balance sheet
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.720]   of Meritas as a life insurance company or if you were to compare the balance sheet of
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:36.240]   Meritas to a company like MetLife or Prudential, some of just these huge, huge companies, there's
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.400]   a massive difference of scale.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.280]   And so whatever the insurance product is that you're buying, you've got to make sure that
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:48.480]   it's okay and that you're not losing something significant by playing with the small dog
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.480]   in the yard.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.320]   A 10-year, 20-year term policy, it's no big deal.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.400]   Anything else other than that, it might or might not be a big deal.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.360]   So I don't buy the idea that commissions are the only thing, but I thank you for making
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360]   us aware of it.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.120]   So I appreciate you guys helping me to learn.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   Next question, Julian.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   Hey, Josh.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   This is Julian.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.120]   Cheers from Chicago.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.440]   I've been a big fan of the show since day one and a Patreon for as long as that's been
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   possible.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.960]   I really love the show and I really appreciate everything you do for the community and to
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.400]   advance the mission.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.800]   Had a question about certifications.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:33.480]   You don't have any certifications from the IMCA, either the CEMA certification or the
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.840]   CPWA certification.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.640]   Definitely avoiding those certifications or never got around to it.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.840]   What are your thoughts?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.400]   Money Julian, didn't want to pay for them.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.840]   It's as simple as that.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.440]   So all of the financial planning designations and certifications that I've accumulated through
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.600]   the years with the exception of the CFP designation, which is administered by the CFP board, all
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.240]   of them come from a college called the American College.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.880]   The American College is a college that is specifically exclusively focused on financial
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   services education.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.920]   But you need to understand the background of that college and the background of where
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.840]   their educational programs came from.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.920]   Originally, I could be wrong on this, but I'm pretty confident about this.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:30.580]   Originally, the American College started around a designation called the CLU, the Chartered
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.360]   Life Underwriter.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.600]   That was where they made their mark.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.400]   Solomon Huebner was one of the major people who was involved in building out the academic
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.240]   framework around insurance.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.960]   In the early days of the life insurance industry, there wasn't a lot of great professional training.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.680]   As the life insurance industry developed, as the products developed, then there was
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.760]   a need for more training.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.920]   Solomon Huebner was one of the heroes of that business and they got involved in the educational
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   business.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.400]   The American College traditionally was built on that CLU designation and that was a designation
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.960]   exclusively for insurance agents.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.300]   Now they went on and they developed other designations.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.880]   They actually developed a more comprehensive financial planning designation called the
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.240]   CHFC, the Chartered Financial Consultant.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.000]   But over time, the insurance companies grew to have a very close relationship with the
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.200]   American College and to this day, that still exists.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.240]   If you were to look, for example, at the American College website, you'll see that all of their
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:38.240]   different schools within the college are sponsored by insurance companies.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.560]   You've got the New York Life blah, blah, blah, the Met Life blah, blah, blah, the Northwestern
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.720]   Mutual blah, blah, blah, the different school that's sponsored by an insurance company.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.960]   There's a very tight relationship there between the insurance companies and the American College.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.080]   Merrill Lynch doesn't have a school named after them.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.720]   They don't sponsor a center at the American College.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.160]   Morgan Stanley doesn't sponsor a center at the American College.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.480]   So the wealth management folks have other places of learning and part of that has been
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.360]   the CFP board but then other areas of specialty have emerged.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.440]   Well, because I was working for Northwestern Mutual, Northwestern Mutual had a relationship
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.760]   with the American College where they would actually – as part of my contract, they
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:28.240]   would pay 100% of the cost of any credentials or designations that I chose to pursue through
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   the American College and also with the CFP board.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.240]   And so I just simply believed in maximizing my contract.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.880]   Don't walk away from free money.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.040]   Why walk away from – yeah, why walk away from free money?
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.280]   And so my responsibility was to pass the exams but I just lined them up and took them down
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.640]   in the most efficient and fastest way I could.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.120]   But I did it where – in the place where Northwestern Mutual was paying the bill.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:04.920]   And if I wanted to go and pursue a SEMA designation or CPWA, the wealth advisor, private wealth
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.520]   advisor designation, then that comes out of my pocket and I would have to pay for it.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.080]   So I didn't see any reason to go and buy that stuff when I could – number one, I
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.960]   could get plenty of letters without paying for money and then I could just go get the
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.080]   education from reading the books and I didn't feel the need for – I mean I already have
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   too many letters.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   I don't need any more of that.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.720]   I can just read the books and I don't need to prove anything by having more letters.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.360]   I don't need the CPWA to make people think I'm smart.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.380]   They think I'm smart just with everything that's already there.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.380]   So that was my efficient way of skinning the cat.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.740]   But what I would say for you, number one, is are you paying for it or is somebody else?
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.200]   If you're paying for it, then you need to make sure that you're getting your bang
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.400]   for the buck.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.840]   And so do you need it?
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   Is it going to be helpful?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.400]   Consumers – here's an example.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.200]   Consumers don't have a clue what any of those designations mean.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.640]   The only financial designation that I think has any clout with consumers is the CFP.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:08.220]   CFP aggressively markets it and they've done a good job of raising their – raising
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.120]   the knowledge and benefit of it.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.120]   So if you're going to pursue it, there's got to be a reason for it.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.520]   Do you need the knowledge and is that an efficient way of capturing the knowledge?
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.680]   It might be.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.920]   And then also if so, then choose the designation that's going to give you the most specific
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.040]   knowledge that's going to be helpful to you.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:33.140]   And then make sure you're choosing the designation that's going to be helpful in your field.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:38.040]   So that answer should emerge fairly naturally.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.560]   But simple answer was I never bought any of that stuff.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.200]   It was all part of the contract and the contract covers stuff from the American College.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.760]   It didn't cover stuff – it didn't cover the other designations.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.160]   So cool question.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.680]   Next question comes from Ty.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.920]   How's it going, Joshua?
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.400]   My name is Ty Walters and I have a blog at SustainableLifeFitness.com.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.040]   I'm also a fan of the Survival Podcast with Jack Spierko.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   So kudos.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.800]   I'm working towards financial independence and I believe that for me and my business
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.600]   model that podcasting is one of the best avenues to pursue.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:19.800]   I also believe in the quantity model of podcasting of producing a near daily show to finance
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   my efforts.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:27.360]   You've mentioned in previous episodes that although you receive above average participation
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.320]   in your Patreon program that you still remain doubtful as to the effectiveness to finance
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.000]   your efforts.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.080]   In episode 166, you talked about the advantages of hosting a daily show in regards to the
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.520]   CPM model or cost per advertisers that will pay you for 1,000 listeners.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.240]   Based on your current statistics, you estimated that if you produced four shows a month, you
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.360]   could produce roughly $1,000 per month of revenue.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.000]   But if you produced 20 shows per month that you could generate over $5,000 per month which
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.420]   is substantially different.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:07.500]   My question is this, taking your listener feedback and earning potential into account,
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:13.080]   if you were to start from scratch, would you still produce a daily show?
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.320]   Thanks Joshua and I look forward to your thoughts.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:22.760]   Ty, that's a hard question to answer because with my business plan, if I were going to
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.340]   start from scratch, yes, I would still produce a daily show.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:33.760]   But remember that the money aspect as far as advertisers is only one component of the
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.760]   show.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:41.800]   Rather, I was focused aggressively on trying to say how can I create content so that people
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.240]   will be aware of me because I didn't have any other platform to stand on.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.960]   I didn't have any name recognition.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.800]   I didn't have anything out there.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:55.160]   So my strategy, if you go back and you obviously listen to that show, but my strategy was to
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:03.000]   say there's a need here that's not being fed with useful, in-depth, comprehensive financial
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   content.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.080]   I see that that's not being met and so I think that I'm uniquely qualified to meet that need
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:17.680]   and I need to get as much of it out there as quickly as possible in order to hit that
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.880]   need.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.920]   And so I also recognize that if the more breadth, the more different topics I could create shows
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:31.640]   on, that would allow me to build a broader net and so meeting that need but also kind
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.480]   of bringing more people into the fold.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:39.860]   And so recognize that it wasn't a matter of the daily aspect of it.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:45.880]   It was a matter of me recognizing the broad, just the need that was there.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:51.800]   And I think if you look at any podcast that's been effective in its growth, it's not so
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.240]   much the format.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.440]   It's not daily or not daily.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.440]   It's that there's a hunger for interesting, unique information.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.600]   So the good example would be, you mentioned Jack Spirico and his show, The Survival Podcast.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.760]   What makes his show unique is not the daily nature of it.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   I think daily might contribute to it and he's in a good habit with his show creation but
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.880]   it's not the fact that he does a show every day.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's the fact that he has an ability to think about a topic, survivalism, in a much more
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.360]   interesting way than most people.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.440]   Most people that talk about survivalism, basically they're saying there's going to be an EMP
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.280]   flare and it's going to be the end of the world as we know it.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.300]   We got to head for the hills and so what we need to do is every day we need to focus on
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.600]   packing a bug out bag.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.360]   And so they get obsessed with the nitty gritty of a bug out bag.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   Well guess what?
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.360]   There's a ton of mess out there that are on that.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.560]   It doesn't matter whether they're daily or not.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.360]   At some point in time you've heard enough about the newest lightweight tent that you
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.440]   can use to pack up in your bag.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.040]   Now I enjoy going on YouTube and watching their YouTube channels from time to time but
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.920]   you can't take that kind of thing every day and you certainly can't build it for an hour
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.040]   a day.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.520]   But what Jack does on his show is very different.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.660]   He doesn't talk about any of that standard stuff.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.720]   He talks about interesting concepts.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.680]   He talks about lifestyle.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.480]   He talks about things that are integrated.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:27.440]   And so he – yeah, survivalism is kind of the hook that gets a certain type of person
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   in.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.080]   But once they're there, they stick around because the content is so interesting and
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.480]   varied and useful.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.360]   And that's what I do with Radical Personal Finance as well.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.480]   I talk about finance but I try to think of ways that are really practical to integrate
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.600]   it and make it applicable to situations.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:53.080]   And so I think that's one of the major things as to why the show has grown effectively.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.820]   So my challenge to you would not be to say, "Should I record a show every day or should
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.840]   I record a show once a week?"
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.360]   My challenge to you would be to say, "Do you have the breadth of information or the
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.520]   breadth of ideas that you could create that much content and effectively serve your audience?"
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.320]   It's okay if you don't.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.560]   There are many excellent shows that are going to be very, very focused on niche topics.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.240]   I listen to some podcasts that are very, very focused on niche topics.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.800]   I'm intentionally pursuing a different strategy than most people and I don't recommend my
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   strategy.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:37.360]   It's just what I think fits my abilities and what I think fits the market need that's
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.520]   out there.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.240]   But if I sign up for – let me give you an example.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.240]   So I've been listening to a public speaking podcast recently.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.100]   I'm working hard to build the back end of my business.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.680]   One of those components is public speaking.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.280]   I don't want to listen to this public – I'm tuned into this podcast because I care about
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.120]   that one specific subject, public speaking.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.960]   And so the type of content that I'm getting there, I would be really annoyed with that
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.320]   show if they went into all these different areas.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.240]   That would not fit that need.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.760]   So that podcast creator doesn't need to create a daily show.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.240]   They just need to create – they do a weekly show, which is fine, or it can even be a biweekly
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.760]   show, but make it the best information on public speaking and keep it laser focused
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.760]   on public speaking.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.160]   Let me give you an example.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.320]   Compare my show to a show like David Stein's, Money for the Rest of Us.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.440]   I was just talking with David when we were up at FinCon.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.520]   We were talking about him.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.500]   His show is doing awesome.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.160]   He is consistently in the top 10 in iTunes.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.040]   He is consistently doing his show.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.120]   Audience size is about triple the size of this audience right now.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.280]   He is just doing an incredible job, but he's laser focused on his topics.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.720]   He is honed in and he produces more – I think he does more than – I can't remember
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.620]   what his publishing schedule is, but he produces a number of shows, but he's laser focused
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:04.720]   on one specific topic and he's very effective at it and it works really, really well.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.360]   I would be bored stiff trying to create that kind of show.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.120]   I would be driven mad by trying to do that.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   That's not me.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.360]   I don't want to actually do that.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.680]   That's why I only do technical financial planning on this show once a week.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.160]   I don't want to talk about it more than that.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.480]   I get really bored.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.320]   I like all the rest of this stuff that I talk about.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.360]   So a lot of people will skip my show and go to David's show.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.280]   If they just want laser focused investment advice, they should go listen to David's
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   show.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.340]   The people that are going to stick around in my show are going to be interested in more
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.760]   of these different topics.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:51.420]   So look at your business and ask yourself, "What do you actually want to create and
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.240]   why are you actually creating it?"
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.640]   That would be the key.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:02.280]   Final comment for you, podcasting as a business is a terrible business.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:09.560]   Podcasting as a platform to support your business, I am convinced can be an amazing business.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.320]   So that is the model that I am pursuing.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.960]   Let me just amplify so that you know.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.120]   So Patreon ads, so recognize this.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:27.040]   The median podcast downloads, 50% of podcasts that are out there have fewer than 160 downloads
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.880]   per episode.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:36.240]   50% of podcasts that exist have fewer than 160 downloads per episode.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:47.000]   The top 10% of podcasts have 4,412 downloads per episode.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Top 5% is 11,565 downloads per episode.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.240]   Top 1% is 51,282 downloads per episode.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:04.440]   So you've got to get up to 5,000 downloads per episode to be in the top 9.2% of all podcast
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.400]   listenership audiences.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.200]   That's basically where radical personal finance is at this point in time.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.320]   So if you look at that, recognize the fact that – run the numbers on that from an advertising
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.760]   perspective on everything that I told you in that other episode.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.400]   Look at the numbers of the Patreon supporters.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:33.560]   I'm so incredibly grateful to the Patreon supporters of this show because without them,
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   everything has been built on that.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:40.960]   I've done that intentionally to align my interests in the best direction.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.280]   But just recognize the fact that you've got to be in the top 10% and even there, you
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.200]   really can't make a living on podcasting.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.080]   Now if you get in the top 1%, 50,000 downloads per episode, you're in one of these comedy
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.120]   podcasts or things like that, yes, you can make a living on ads.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.280]   So my challenge to you with just what I perceive from taking a quick look at your site, build
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:12.360]   your business, the backend business, and use podcasting as a gateway to that business rather
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.400]   than trying to build your business on podcasting.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.480]   I think it's a much safer bet.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.880]   Just the other thing finally I would say, recognize that to do a daily show is an absolutely
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.400]   exhausting amount of work.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.040]   It's absolutely exhausting.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.520]   As I record these words right now, it is 1.33 a.m. on – this is – well, it's Friday
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   night, Saturday morning now.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.560]   It's 1.33 a.m. and I'm recording my Friday show.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.240]   It won't be published till Saturday.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:48.480]   It's an exhausting amount of work and I could never have done a daily podcast the way that
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.600]   I did it if I had been working a full-time job.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.760]   I did a daily podcast because that was the other thing.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:03.600]   As I gave myself one year and I said, "I've got to pour everything on as hard as I can
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   in order to make this work."
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.640]   So hopefully those are just some ideas that are useful.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:13.960]   Build your backend business and then use your podcast as leverage as part of your total
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.160]   overall business.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.040]   But it's a bad idea, a bad business move to try to build everything on the backs of
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   a podcast.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:27.720]   I'm not even – I built it on the back of a podcast but now I'm working on the backend
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   business.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.200]   I'm working on developing the products and the services and the things that are going
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.880]   to effectively serve my audience with the specific answers that they need.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.720]   So Ty, I hope that is useful to you.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.120]   Two more questions.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.880]   Before I get to the last two questions though, let me take care of sponsor of the day number
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   two.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.760]   Sponsor of the day number two today is Audible.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.520]   If you're not listening to audiobooks, number one, you should be.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.600]   If you want to be sold on that, I'll sell you on that in episode 219.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   Go back and listen to episode 219 of the show which was Hacking Audiobooks and the Audiobook
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   Marketplace.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:12.020]   You'll hear all the reasons why I think that you should make regular audiobook listening
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.400]   part of your learning strategy.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.440]   But today, I just want to give you two interesting Audible book recommendations that many of
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.280]   you might enjoy.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:27.200]   So you all know with my strategy, I like to bring together Audible as my paid audiobook
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:33.920]   subscriptions with the other audiobook subscription services that I use, Scribd, Hoopla, and Overdrive
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.520]   that are cheaper or free.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.880]   Scribd is $9 a month.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   Hoopla and Overdrive are free.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   Audible is $15 a month.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.760]   So why do I pay $15 a month?
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.240]   Well, it's because I get books on Audible that I can't get in those other places for
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   free.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.360]   So if I can find them on the library for free, I'll do that.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.200]   But I can't find a lot of the books that I need and want to read.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.640]   So lately, I've been reading a lot in the area of monetary history.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.120]   This is one of the themes I've really been wanting to dig into.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   I want to talk about money.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.360]   I want to talk about monetary history.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.760]   I want to talk about some of these things from a macroeconomic perspective because there's
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.200]   a lot of stuff out there.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:16.160]   But frankly, I often feel a little bit unsure of am I even prepared to talk about that.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.320]   Do I even know what I'm talking about?
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.680]   And so I've been reading through and I picked out a trilogy and I finished two of them.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.080]   But I thought it would be interesting.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.000]   So here are the two recommendations.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   The first one is good.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   The second one is better.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.400]   But the first one is a book called Coined by Kabir Sehgal.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.440]   And I actually just saw him speak at FinCon.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.240]   He was one of the keynote speakers and he wrote this book called Coined.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.680]   It goes through the history of money.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.800]   It's an excellent book.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.240]   Different and I actually preferred it was a book – is a book called Money, an unauthorized
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.600]   biography by an author named Felix Martin.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   This book is awesome.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.560]   If you only read one of them, the third trilogy was William Gravener's book Debt, the First
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   5,000 Years.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.040]   I haven't read that one yet.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.840]   But this book is awesome.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.440]   I listened to both of these while I was working on my house.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.240]   I was painting, getting the house ready to list on the market, doing things like that.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.320]   I was able to listen to these and I consumed I think nine books that week while I was working
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.460]   on house stuff.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.800]   So if you listen to my show while you're out working on a house, good for you and make
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.360]   sure that you house painters and house construction people should be the most – you should be
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:31.480]   the most knowledgeable and learned people just simply through listening to audio books.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.960]   So the book that I would recommend for you, listen to a book called Money, an Unauthorized
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.400]   Biography by Felix Martin.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:44.200]   It goes through all the details of how money came to be and most importantly, it goes through
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.480]   how banking systems have grown and been created over time.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.680]   And it's really, really fascinating because he explains clearly the question that I've
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.400]   had which is, okay, there's different banking systems.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   There's hard money.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   There's soft money.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.320]   I personally like think, wow, the hard money stuff makes a lot of sense.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:08.160]   The reason I started reading these books is because I couldn't argue for the Federal
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   Reserve System.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.480]   I couldn't argue for the soft money approach.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.680]   And what – personally, the way I try to approach an argument is I try to say, let
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.560]   me figure out how to argue my opponent's position better and see if it defeats my arguments.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.680]   And then if my arguments stand up to it, then it works out.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.000]   So that was why I bought these books.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.040]   So check out Audible.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.180]   If you go to RadicalAudioBooks.com, you can get a free audio book download of your choice

[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   All right.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.920]   Two more questions.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.600]   Let's get to it.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.960]   Question here from David.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   My name is David.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.500]   I'm a teacher from Chicago.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   Thank you so much.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.040]   I've been a long-time listener and this is actually my first time calling.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.160]   I have two questions.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.760]   Next year, I have gained a new position in a very lucrative district and I will be paid
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.400]   considerably more.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.920]   I have the option of being able to max out my 403(b) for the first time.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.000]   However, I'm also trying to save for a down payment.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.720]   So my question is if I'm looking at a horizon of four years to save 20% for my down payment,
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:28.240]   should I cut that in half and put my priority toward a down payment or should I put my focus
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.260]   on maxing out my 403(b) to take advantage of the long-term compounding?
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:38.120]   My second question is even though I'm 31 years old, I am hoping to start my master's degree
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.360]   here in about two years.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:49.680]   So my other question is should I open a 509 for myself, therein allowing me to sock some
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:55.840]   money away and take advantage of my tax leveraging even more?
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.720]   Any thoughts on that would be much appreciated.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   Thanks.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.680]   David, congratulations, dude, on making some money and moving to a much more lucrative
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   district.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   Good for you.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.880]   So question number one, should I put money in the 403(b) or should I prioritize saving
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.160]   for the down payment?
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.000]   Here's my answer.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.420]   The question properly framed is should I invest money for my future or should I save money
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.720]   for my consumption?
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.580]   Recognize that at its base.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.720]   The down payment is a consumption item.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.480]   I'm assuming that you're wanting to buy a house for yourself or to house you and your
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   family.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.360]   You want to buy and own a house to live in.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.280]   That's a consumption item.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.640]   Putting money into the 403(b) assuming that you're investing it into the 403(b) is an
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.960]   investment.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:49.460]   So you're building capital to pay your expenses from.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:59.000]   If that's accurate, then I personally would rather prioritize the investment rather than
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.440]   the consumption.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.640]   If your goal or my goal, I can't remember whether I was talking to you or me, if the
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:11.800]   goal is to be wealthy, then I want to prioritize the investment and not the consumption.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.920]   Run the math and ask yourself what the net effect on your wealth will be of four years
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.920]   of maximized 403(b) contributions versus having money for a down payment.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.520]   Now what about buying the house?
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.480]   Well, that's the problem is that life's not all about getting as rich as possible.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.680]   And so if you do want to buy a house, then you're going to have to buy the house at some
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   point.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.320]   But fundamentally recognize your question is investment versus consumption.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.960]   When should you make the consumption decision?
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.520]   I don't know.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.760]   That's your decision.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.680]   And if you know that you're going to consume the money, then yes, you've got to plan for
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   it.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.280]   So two years, four years, I don't have any way to answer that question.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:38:01.720]   I will tell you that I learned a number of lessons in purchasing my house and I'm hoping
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.240]   that it gets sold.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.120]   It's currently under contract as of yesterday.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.440]   It's under contract and theoretically this closing is scheduled for the end of the month.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.960]   We'll see if the deal holds up.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.280]   So far everything looks good.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.760]   And then after the house sells, I will come back and I'll share a report.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.040]   But a little teaser here.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.680]   When I bought my house, I put 20% down.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:29.400]   And up until actually doing that, I would always have encouraged people to put 20% down.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.640]   And this is the standard financial advice.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.200]   It's advice I have given many times.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   It's advice I would have given and it's advice that I took myself.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.680]   The idea behind the 20% down payment is a couple of things.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:46.960]   Number one, it indicates that having a 20% down payment indicates that you've saved some
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.000]   money over time.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.680]   So you're not buying at the limit of your ability.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.280]   You're not strapped for cash and just clawing and scraping to get a house.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.840]   No, you have some cash and you've been planning for something for a while.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.320]   So that's good.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.440]   Number two, it gets you the most favorable financing rates.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.120]   It gets you conventional mortgage rates.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.160]   It's going to be very low.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.480]   It allows you – the big one is it allows you to avoid PMI, private mortgage insurance.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.600]   So that saves you money and that can be a substantial cost depending on the actual numbers
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.880]   involved.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.620]   So it can be a good decision.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.600]   And that was always the advice I gave.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   Put 20% down.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.200]   My wife and I, we worked hard to put 20% down on our house.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:38.400]   Here's what I learned through hard experience.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:49.840]   Having a house 20% paid off is absolutely useless to me for my lifestyle.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.080]   What I mean is that having a house that's 100% paid off, free and clear, that is incredibly
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.560]   useful to me because if I own my house and I don't owe any mortgage payments, that
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:05.640]   puts a dramatic decrease in my need for cash flow.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.000]   But having the house 20% paid off, what does it matter?
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.160]   I still have a mortgage payment.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.960]   And that was the challenge that I was personally facing a year ago realizing this in the hard
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.360]   one way is, "Wait a second.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   This sucks.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.900]   I've got to make a mortgage payment every month and I don't have access to this cash
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:27.040]   that's in my house and I didn't want to go and take out a home equity line of credit."
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.880]   So I took all my money and I took it out of the bank account and I put it into a house.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.480]   But I still had to make a mortgage payment.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.080]   So now I've got the house but now I've got the debt and I've lost all my money because
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.000]   it's all in the house.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.520]   That doesn't work so well.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.940]   So what I determined for me is that I said, "In the future, one of the major changes
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.880]   I will make is I will put either the bare minimum down.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.220]   If I ever buy a house again," which I probably will, "I will either put the bare minimum
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:41:03.220]   down or I'll just pay cash because everything in the middle is basically no man's land."
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.740]   Now that's kind of unusual advice.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:08.900]   Now here's why that advice is bad advice in the broad marketplace.
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.220]   Most people aren't able to save money.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.220]   And if they have – let's say your down payment is $50,000.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:19.180]   If you got $50,000 in a checking account, most people will spend it.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.380]   But if you're talking about investment, you're saying, "Should I invest this money or should
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.960]   I even just keep it in savings or should I put it into the house?"
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:32.220]   You are safer if you have the money in cash simply because what would you – okay, you
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.220]   lose your job.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:38.620]   Would you rather have a house that's 20% paid off and no money to make your mortgage
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.940]   payments that you still owe or rather have a house that's 3% paid off?
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.100]   You have a 97% mortgage balance and $50,000 in the bank.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.300]   I'll take the $50,000 in the bank.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.980]   It's a safer position.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.020]   I've got a buffer there.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.980]   So the key caveat is you can't spend the money.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:00.220]   But if you are a savior, if you're a disciplined savior, if you're an investor, then I'd
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.220]   keep the money.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.620]   That's what I intend to do if I buy a house again is again, I'll either put the bare
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:11.660]   minimum down on it or I will and keep my money liquid, keep my money available to me, keep
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:16.780]   my money as a buffer, keep my money available to invest in businesses, keep my money available
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.820]   to buy rental houses or I'll just pay cash for the house which thus eliminates the mortgage
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.780]   payment which is really useful.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.780]   So hopefully that's even useful to you as well.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:32.720]   So my point in all of that is that if you did prioritize putting money into your retirement
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.740]   account over the next few years and if you did buy a house under something like an FHA
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:44.460]   loan where you're putting a much smaller down payment on down, I wouldn't fault you for
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.460]   that.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.900]   That's what I would do if I were in your shoes.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.900]   So hopefully that's useful.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:54.860]   If you were saving money for a rental property, that was the only other aspect of the question
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   that I would mention to you.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.260]   If you were actually – if you met down payment on a rental property, skip the 403(b), put
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.980]   the down payment on a rental property, well-managed and effectively done, you should have far
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.940]   higher returns and I would do that.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.580]   Another question, should I open a 529 plan for myself if I'm saving for a master's
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.580]   degree?
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.580]   Let's see.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:12.580]   So you live in the state of Illinois.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:20.300]   Illinois allows a $10,000 in state income tax deduction for 529 plan contributions for
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:26.020]   a single person, $20,000 for a joint per beneficiary.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.300]   So the answer is yes.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.020]   If you are going to spend the money on a master's degree and if you're going to finance it yourself,
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.260]   toss the money in through a 529, channel it through there and save a little bit of your
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.260]   state income taxes.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.260]   That's my answer.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.060]   The last question comes from Kyle.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.460]   Hi, Josh.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.460]   This is Kyle.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:47.580]   I have basically a three-part question for you and they're not really related to each
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.980]   other but I was hoping you can bang all of them out.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:57.780]   First question is, what are your thoughts on leveraged index funds and also momentum
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.100]   funds, volatility funds?
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.380]   Do you think that's a good idea?
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:07.580]   I mean, I know the volatility would be higher but if it's following the index, shouldn't
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:11.260]   that juice up your returns over the long run?
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:17.240]   Second question is, what are your thoughts on instead of buying, say, a total market
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:24.140]   index or even just the S&P 500, what are your thoughts on buying all the sector funds that
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:32.900]   make up the S&P 500, materials, utilities, financials, etc. in equal amounts?
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:37.420]   That way it's more equally weighted and then I can also take advantage of the lows and
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.340]   highs of each sector.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:45.000]   I think utilities are down this year so now I can invest more in that specific sector
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.800]   to try to take advantage of the lows and the highs.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.340]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:56.860]   Third question is, do you have any thoughts or do you know of any historical data on when
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:03.620]   the stock market always goes down or up in terms of major events such as presidential
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.980]   elections, certain holidays, things like that.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:13.420]   I didn't know if there was any consistent data that showed certain sways in the market
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.900]   in one way or direction during those times.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.900]   Thanks so much, Josh.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.380]   Feel free to answer all those or just one or two of them.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.820]   But I'd love to hear your advice.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:22.820]   Thanks so much.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:28.660]   I'll answer all of them and I'll do it with quick hits because – well, partly because
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.860]   it's 1.49 a.m. and I want to go to bed.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.740]   But also I just think – I'll just give some quick answers here and I think it'll
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.500]   be – I'll just try to share some thoughts.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:43.220]   But some of these trading strategies are – it's my weakest area of knowledge.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:48.580]   It's where I – I try not to say something stupid.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.620]   So number one, leveraged index funds.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:54.340]   I think they would make sense as a hedging strategy of some kind.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:58.900]   That's the only way that I could see owning them myself.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:03.620]   If you are trying to say I'm trying to hedge the bulk of my portfolio from some certain
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:11.900]   move and you are developing a trading strategy with a leveraged index fund as a hedge, that
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.900]   makes sense.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.020]   But if I was owning it and saying I'm going to buy this and own this, I wouldn't do
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.020]   it.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.700]   I just don't see – I wouldn't do it.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.060]   Number two, thoughts on buying the sector funds in equal amounts.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.660]   I don't have a clue on that one.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.060]   I kind of see what you're going towards.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:36.180]   But I would say test it or get in one of the trading forums and see if you can find some
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:40.380]   people who are more attuned to that side of the market who can share those thoughts with
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.380]   you.
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.100]   Final though, this was the one I did want to talk about, thoughts on when the stock
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.500]   market always goes up or always goes down on major events.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.500]   I don't think they exist.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.980]   If they do exist, you're too late to the party.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:57.540]   I look at this and I used to get excited by hearing about the dogs of the Dow or getting
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.900]   hearing about the – well, in the fall, this always happens or in the summer, this happens,
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.420]   I've never seen any proof that any of those things are predictable.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.940]   What happens is you got so many people looking for that, that once you find a pattern, it's
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.420]   too late.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:19.580]   So if you do find a pattern, don't tell anybody because if you find a pattern, you
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.580]   don't do it.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.600]   So I've just never seen any indication that those things are reliable or at least reliable
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.220]   enough to be traded upon.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.740]   Is it possible that on a holiday weekend, a certain thing always happens?
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:35.100]   Well, it's possible and you'll hear the commentators talk about it.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:41.700]   But I've never seen any compelling evidence that would indicate that it's something
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.580]   that could be acted upon, known in advance and acted upon.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.900]   So one thing to look through a data set and be able to say, "Oh, look.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.860]   Hey, here's what happened in these certain things in the past."
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:57.060]   It's another thing to find something that you are able to actually put a trade in place
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.940]   on because of that.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.300]   If you can't find the trade, then what's the point of the data?
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:08.100]   The data just shows here's what happened in the last 70 years, but now we figured out
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:14.260]   that that's what happened and so now we've ironed out that inefficiency in the market.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.180]   So that would be my commentary on it.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.540]   I would love to be wrong.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.120]   I wanted to play your question.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.980]   So if anybody else knows of any data or articles, come by the show notes for today's show and
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.580]   comment so that Kyle can get some of that information.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:34.140]   But Kyle, I'm sorry, I don't have much more for you, but hopefully it's at least something.
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.540]   It's a start.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.180]   So thank you all so much for listening.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.820]   I feel like my timing was a little bit off today.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:39.820]   Hope you enjoyed the show.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:44.860]   I missed these shows and I really wanted to get back to it.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.700]   They're hard for me because, well, they're hard.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.580]   They take a long time to prepare, but I really wanted to get back to it.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.380]   So if my timing was off, forgive me.
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.740]   I will keep working hard to do better.
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.500]   Make sure you check out our sponsor for today.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.780]   Number one, you need a budget.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780]   YNAB.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.940]   Find that link at radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:09.100]   If you are not using YNAB budgeting software, it's a blanket statement.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.460]   I don't make a lot of them, but if you are not using YNAB budgeting software, give it
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.460]   a try.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.980]   I really think you should be.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:17.660]   Give it a 30-day free trial.
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.900]   Doesn't cost you anything to check it out.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.300]   It's the full version of the software.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.860]   It's not a fake small version.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.260]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:30.660]   Number two, if you would like to listen to a cool audiobook and check it out on Audible,
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.060]   it's not on any of the free places, listen to Money, an unauthorized biography.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.860]   You can find that at radicalaudiobooks.com.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.020]   Set up a free trial account and you can download that.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.420]   Finally, I want to thank each and every one of you who's supporting the show on Patreon.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.820]   Big press in September was to bring it up to 250 total patrons.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.820]   We didn't hit 250.
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.820]   We hit 230, which is awesome.
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:57.180]   At the moment, a total of $2,598 a month in pledges.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.300]   I want to thank you guys.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:03.740]   I hope that earlier when I was responding to the question about podcasting business
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.500]   models, I just wanted you guys to know, I hope I wasn't sliding.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.300]   I kind of felt after the fact maybe I was sliding.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.020]   I couldn't have done the show as I've been doing it without the support of the patrons.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:22.460]   As I'm bringing sponsors and advertisers on still, my rent payment is being paid by you
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.460]   guys.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.620]   That's what allows me to keep doing the show as much as I'm doing it.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.460]   That's why I'm working hard on it.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.500]   I want to thank each and every one of you who's supporting the show.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.860]   If you'd like to just support the show directly, please patronize one of the advertisers or
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.940]   patronize me directly.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.820]   That means all the world to me.
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:45.820]   You can do that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.820]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.460]   I will be back with you soon.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.340]   Comment on today's notes if you think I was wrong, if you liked it.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.580]   Find all that at radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.580]   Cheers.
