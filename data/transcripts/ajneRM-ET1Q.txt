[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.400]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.760]   My guest today is Esther Perel.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.560]   Esther Perel is a psychotherapist
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.480]   and one of the world's foremost experts
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.360]   on romantic relationships.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.360]   She's also the author of best-selling books
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.160]   such as "Mating in Captivity" and "The State of Affairs."
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640]   Today's discussion focuses on what it means
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.920]   to be in a truly functional romantic relationship.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700]   We discuss this from the standpoint of identity,
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.600]   that is, how people both try to hold onto
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.440]   and evolve their identities within a relationship,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.280]   and how a truly functional romantic relationship
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.760]   indeed evolves over time
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.960]   from a standpoint of curiosity and adventure,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.360]   but also one in which people need to hold on
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.240]   to certain components of themselves.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.960]   We explore what conflict in relationships looks like
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.640]   and the dynamics that underlie those conflicts,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.920]   so focusing less on specific scenarios,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.240]   but rather the dynamics that exist in conflicts
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.600]   in romantic relationship across all different situations
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.480]   and different combinations of people.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.680]   And of course, we also talk about
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.300]   what healthy conflict resolution looks like,
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.760]   what a truly effective apology looks and sounds like,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.740]   and we explore the erotic aspects of relationships,
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.120]   comparing and contrasting, for instance, love and desire,
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.280]   how sometimes those things run in parallel
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.440]   in the same direction,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.860]   how sometimes those run in opposite directions,
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.240]   and how people can explore their own notions,
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.520]   their own models of love and desire
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.640]   in order to have more effective romantic relationships.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.140]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.640]   you will learn from the world's foremost expert
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280]   on romantic relationships,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.440]   how to find, build, and revive romantic relationships
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.760]   that feel most satisfying to all partners involved.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.560]   I'm also pleased to announce that Esther Perel
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.160]   has just released a new course on intimacy.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.580]   You can find a link to that course
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.960]   in the show note captions,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.440]   as well as links to her books, her podcast,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.340]   and other resources about romantic relationships.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.160]   Before you begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.080]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.680]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.860]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.780]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.760]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.100]   to the general public.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.200]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.840]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.680]   Our first sponsor is David.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.360]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.320]   It has 28 grams of protein,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.840]   only 150 calories, and zero grams of sugar.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.660]   That's right, 28 grams of protein,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.820]   and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.380]   This is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.940]   These bars from David also taste incredible.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.500]   My favorite bar is the cake-flavored one,
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.460]   but then again, I also like the chocolate-flavored one,
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.740]   and I like the berry-flavored one.
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.280]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.060]   They're all incredibly delicious.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.100]   Now, for me personally,
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.760]   I try to get most of my calories from whole foods.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.580]   However, when I'm in a rush, or I'm away from home,
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.780]   or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack,
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.860]   I often find that I'm looking
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.740]   for a high-quality protein source.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.060]   And with David, I'm able to get 28 grams
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.860]   of high-quality protein with the calories of a snack,
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.900]   which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.580]   of one gram of protein per pound of body weight,
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.940]   and it allows me to do so
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.300]   without taking on an excess of calories.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.620]   Again, I focus on getting most of my food
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.880]   from whole food sources throughout the day,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.460]   but I typically eat a David bar in the late afternoon
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.940]   when I get hungry between lunch and dinner,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.620]   sometimes also mid-morning if I get hungry then,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.220]   and sometimes I'll use it as a meal replacement.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.580]   Although not a complete meal replacement,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.020]   it can get me to the next meal.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.540]   So if I need to eat in a couple of hours,
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.740]   but I'm really hungry, I'll eat a David bar.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.820]   As I mentioned before, they are incredibly delicious.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.540]   In fact, they're surprisingly delicious.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.900]   Even the consistency is great.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.660]   It's more like a cookie consistency,
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.400]   kind of a chewy cookie consistency,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.500]   which is unlike other bars,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.060]   which I tend to kind of saturate on.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.340]   I was never a big fan of bars
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.440]   until I discovered David bars.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.780]   If you give them a try, you'll know what I mean.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.060]   So if you'd like to try David,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.140]   you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.220]   Again, the link is davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.340]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.860]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.220]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.300]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.180]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium, but no sugar.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.540]   Proper hydration is critical
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.980]   for optimal brain and bodily function.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.140]   In fact, even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.360]   is known to diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.520]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.920]   in order to stay hydrated.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.080]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.600]   are vital for the functioning of all cells in your body,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.940]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.400]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.660]   makes it very easy to ensure
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.920]   that you're getting adequate amounts
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.200]   of hydration and electrolytes.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   So to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both,
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.860]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.760]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.200]   when I first wake up in the morning.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.720]   I drink that basically over the first half hour or so
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.560]   that I'm awake,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.680]   and I'll tend to also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.640]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.800]   and I'm losing water and electrolytes.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.980]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.200]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.240]   Again, that's drinkelement spelled L-M-N-T.com/huberman
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.000]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.960]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.180]   Again, drinkelement.com/huberman.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.200]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.080]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.480]   I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.920]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.480]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.000]   physical health, and performance.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.400]   Now, the mattress we sleep on makes an enormous difference
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.840]   in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.680]   We need a mattress that is matched
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.440]   to our unique sleep needs,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.040]   one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you,
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.600]   one that breathes well
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.280]   and that won't be too warm or too cold for you.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.780]   If you go to the Helix website,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.280]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.000]   and it asks you questions such as,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.760]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.840]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.140]   Things of that sort.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.000]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.840]   maybe you don't.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.240]   Either way, Helix will match you
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.840]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.920]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress for,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.120]   gosh, no, more than four years,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.400]   and the sleep that I've been getting
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.200]   is absolutely phenomenal.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.400]   If you'd like to try Helix,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.320]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.960]   take that brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.760]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.160]   that is customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.560]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off mattresses
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.720]   and two free pillows.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.840]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.920]   to get 25% off and two free pillows.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.960]   And now for my discussion with Esther Perel.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.360]   Esther Perel, welcome.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.000]   - Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.120]   - There are so many questions and curiosities
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.600]   and puzzles and challenges
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.900]   around the topic of romantic relationships.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.840]   But what I really want to know is,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.800]   to what extent is the decision to even think
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.040]   about being in a relationship of the romantic type,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.520]   a extension of our identity,
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.040]   or is it really a willingness
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.520]   to potentially embrace a new identity?
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.380]   And I asked this somewhat abstract question
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.600]   for a very specific reason,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.360]   and the reason is the following.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.560]   I think everyone who's been in a romantic relationship,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.680]   or even who just wants one,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.200]   is familiar with the kind of yearning
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.720]   or interest or curiosity.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.360]   And then also with the fact that,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.800]   just like the development of our physical body,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.880]   it has an arc across the lifespan,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.960]   that a relationship has a sort of developmental arc.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.080]   There's the first meeting,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.240]   the first week, the first month, et cetera.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.720]   And so much of what I've seen in your work
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.920]   and in the discussion about relationships
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.800]   in the public sphere,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.440]   seems to be trying to understand how we change
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.160]   in terms of what we want and what we ask for,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.520]   what we feel willing to ask for, et cetera,
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.760]   across this arc of the relationship.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.120]   But what I want to know is,
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.280]   is the decision to enter a romantic relationship,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.720]   a willingness, conscious or unconscious,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.680]   to actually change who we are?
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.280]   In other words, are we entering a relationship
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.960]   to just be ourselves and find someone
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.440]   with whom we go lock and key? - I got it.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.520]   - Or are we really saying,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.600]   hey, even whether or not we realize or not,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.880]   if we're pursuing a relationship,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.080]   are we really basically saying,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.760]   I'm willing to become a different person
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.360]   by virtue of being in a relationship?
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.200]   - I think it is both,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.720]   completely both.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.680]   We meet an other
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.120]   in order to find ourselves.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.920]   And we meet an other
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   and want to be surprised by the self we haven't known.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.200]   I think that all of us come into this world
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.400]   with a fundamental sets of dual needs.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.160]   We need security and we need freedom and adventure.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.120]   And we need togetherness and we need separateness.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.280]   So in the relationship, you come in order
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.560]   to create that identification,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.960]   but also that differentiation.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.120]   It's a dialectic all the time.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.720]   But what's interesting is even if I choose you,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.600]   because you represent sometimes the parts of me
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.440]   that are more challenging or that I disavow
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.280]   or that I prefer to outsource
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.880]   so I don't have to be too vulnerable about them,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.720]   what draws me to you in the beginning,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.960]   because it is different that I think may expand me
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.720]   and make me change is also the very thing
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.240]   that becomes the source of conflict later,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.480]   because we want to change, but up to a point,
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.560]   not too much and not on your terms.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.360]   So we want change, but we sometimes are afraid of change.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.440]   And so we let the other person represent the part of us
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.520]   that would want to change, but then we disconnect from it.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.680]   So you become the representative of that.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.480]   I am drawn to the fact that you are stable,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   grounded, structured, solid, reliable, on time, you name it.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.920]   I know that this is something that I would like
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.520]   to be more of, and just a very simple example,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   but then I start to think of you as rigid
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.040]   because I get a little more than what I bargained for.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.520]   And now I start to argue with your rigidity
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.080]   and my desire to actually become more structured
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.280]   and solid and punctual and reliable has somehow disappeared.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.880]   - So if I understand correctly, we seek out others
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.280]   in order to try and initiate the process
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.240]   of change that we want.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.240]   But then when we hit the friction point,
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.640]   meaning the point where it challenges where we are,
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.200]   then there's a form of resent or frustration.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.440]   The reason I- - Defensiveness.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.760]   - Defensiveness. - Yes.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.120]   You know what it is?
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.000]   Every system straddles stability and change
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.080]   and then grapples for homeostasis.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.960]   Every relationship goes through that,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.680]   every system in nature goes through that.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.500]   But the same thing is true inside an individual.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.960]   We want change and we need stability.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.160]   And then these things sometimes are compensating each other
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.760]   and they are complementary and at times they butt heads.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.320]   - So a very practical question.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.440]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.440]   - What are the necessary but not sufficient elements
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.240]   that somebody should have in themselves
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.920]   before they go seeking a romantic relationship?
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.760]   Meaning, what is necessary in order to be able
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.200]   to embark on the process with any chance of success?
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.720]   Barring extreme pathology, right?
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.000]   Assuming that both people entering the relationship
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.560]   have the best of intentions to make the relationship work,
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.880]   in quotes. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   - Is it both a sense of one's own identity
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.460]   as well as what specifically they would like to change?
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:05.360]   Or is it some other constellation of factors?
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.240]   - Different ways to answer this.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.400]   You know, I think sometimes people say,
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.200]   I wanna be with you because you helped me
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.400]   become the best version of myself.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.520]   - Yeah, you hear that a lot.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.720]   - And so what is that version?
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.360]   Who is it that I want to see
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.960]   that I think you will help me become?
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.160]   - When you talk about these romantic relationships,
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.680]   first of all, I think there's a different answer
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.600]   if we're talking about cornerstone relationships
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.080]   or capstone relationships.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.200]   Do you know the concept?
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.400]   - If you don't mind defining those for the audience.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.000]   - Right, so the cornerstone relationship
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.520]   is when we used to meet in our early 20s
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   and together we build the foundation of our relationship.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.280]   We grew together, we saved our first monies together,
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.960]   we got our first places together, et cetera.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.080]   It was very much foundational.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.320]   Capstone is the foundation has already been established
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.160]   because we tend to meet at this point 10, 12 years later.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.840]   So during those 12 years,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.240]   I've already actually worked, so to speak, on my identity.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.620]   I have defined myself, my values, my aspirations,
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.320]   my constructs, how I want to see my life.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.800]   And when I meet you, you're a confirmation for all of this.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.040]   You're a confirmation of what I've already built
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.800]   and I am putting you and me as the capstone,
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.280]   which we put on top of what we've already created.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.200]   You and me, you've done the same thing.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.840]   So I am looking for someone who recognizes my identity,
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   not for someone who helps me develop my identity
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.760]   from a much earlier age.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.680]   So there's a developmental arc that changes the mandate.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.600]   I said it's both, but the priority of,
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.600]   if it's the building of identity
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.160]   or the expansion of that identity, what you call change,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.400]   differs if you meet somebody when you're young
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.480]   and if you meet somebody when you're in your thirties.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.840]   - What happens when people are mismatched in terms of age?
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.500]   - I mean, there is a big age differences a lot of the time.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.080]   And in gay relationships,
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.540]   you have often a major age difference
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.060]   that means something else,
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.240]   but it creates differentiation.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.000]   In straight relationships,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.520]   you often have men who are a lot more,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.220]   a lot older than the women,
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.060]   very much rooted in evolutionary biology,
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.940]   I think, and fertility.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.220]   But, and now we have more and more,
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.240]   a new phenomenon of older women with younger men,
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.480]   but that's actually been very rare in most cultures.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.800]   - So that's shifting now towards more often
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.120]   people are observing older women with younger men?
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.820]   - You know, when you have four movies at this moment
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.100]   that are talking about this,
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.400]   then you begin to see the crescent
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.960]   of a new cultural phenomenon.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.020]   I don't, I think the fact that it appears in the arts
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.400]   and in the culture usually announces something,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.660]   I wouldn't make it yet a phenomenon.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.200]   But you asked me a question before
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.840]   about what are the things people need.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.240]   I mean, you know, when you embark any relationship,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.960]   it's, again, it's,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.560]   I tend to think as both end on a lot of things.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.480]   I come to you with a certain self-awareness.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.120]   How much self-awareness, the more there is, the better.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   And that self-awareness, I think,
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.940]   as its best translates in a sense of,
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.440]   you know, I think a good vow to say
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.240]   at the time of your wedding is,
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.580]   I'll fuck up on a regular basis,
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.180]   and on occasion, I'll acknowledge it.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.780]   (laughing)
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.520]   It means that self-awareness comes within self-knowledge
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.120]   about your limitations and your ability
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.520]   to take responsibility for it without blame and shame.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.800]   And basically accountability.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.480]   I think accountability is an enormous component
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.440]   of relationship.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.880]   It's okay, we all do things.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.520]   You know, we all have our wounds and our frustrations
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.800]   and our expectations and our unexpressed needs
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.460]   and our unfulfilled longings, et cetera.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.480]   But it's a good thing to know it and to admit it
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.540]   and to not pretend that it's not me, but it's you.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.840]   You know, I often say that couples therapy,
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.400]   I am a practicing couples therapist for almost 40 years,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.240]   and couples often come to therapy
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.880]   thinking that you're a drop-off center.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.320]   You know, they come to deliver their problem,
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.080]   and their problem is their partner.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.680]   And you're gonna fix it.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.660]   And they're gonna help you 'cause they're an expert
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.840]   on what's wrong with the partner.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.120]   And it's an amazing thing how people have tremendous insight
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.080]   on all the shortcomings of the other person
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.840]   and do not see themselves as part of the system.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.840]   A relationship is a breeding,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.240]   living system of interdependent parts.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.200]   - Do you think that's perhaps one reason why people
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.000]   who are in these cornerstone relationships
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.280]   of whom I've known many, you know,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.840]   even family members of mine, you know,
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.080]   met in university, met their significant other,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.480]   and then had their first jobs, moved in together,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.820]   all the things you described, that there's this-
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.900]   - They grow up together.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.500]   - Yeah, and I think it probably happens at a stage of life
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.100]   when there's still a lot more neuroplasticity, frankly.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.820]   I mean, everything I know about neuroplasticity
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.540]   is that it exists across the lifespan,
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.340]   but that it tapers off significantly in one's late 20s.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.420]   And, you know, fortunately it's still available,
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.860]   but the notion of being set in our ways
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.820]   is a neuroplasticity phenomenon, right?
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.580]   - Yes, yes, it's the closing of the prefrontal cortex.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.100]   - Pretty much, pretty much.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.300]   - The fontanelle is still-
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.280]   - Exactly, it takes a lot more to open that plasticity
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.480]   later than it does earlier, certainly.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.920]   And yet it's inversely related to the self-awareness, right?
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.880]   I mean, the younger we are,
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.240]   the less self-aware we are about our patterns
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.360]   because we just have less data over time.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.000]   So I could see how it'd be more difficult
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.320]   for somebody in their 20s to say,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.040]   "Hey, listen, I think I have many virtues,
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.680]   but I have this severe issue with something,
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.160]   or this particularly frustrates me,
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.220]   or here's my laundry list of issues," right?
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.280]   Whereas somebody in their 40s or 50s or older,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   if pressed, could probably make that list
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.480]   if they were really being honest with themselves.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.320]   So it seems like-
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.640]   - I think it's a good point.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.080]   - You know, so it seems that maybe there's a sweet spot,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.840]   but that these earlier relationships,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.080]   I've always been impressed by them
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.440]   and kind of romanticized them in my mind
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.000]   because that wasn't the trajectory that I took, but-
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.400]   - But they have a challenge.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.580]   You see, when you grow up together,
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.580]   you often put a lot of energy into the building of the unit.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.760]   And that unit then is supposed to become your base,
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.200]   your scaffolding from which two individuals
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.360]   can begin to grow and to define themselves.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.960]   When you meet later, you are already two individuals
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.480]   that have defined themselves who now have to find a way
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.680]   to create the energy to come together.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.640]   So it's a different movement.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.120]   It's a different choreography.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.900]   I think that the challenge for young couples today
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.540]   who meet early in college and have known often
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.140]   only themselves and a few people in their teenage years,
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.300]   et cetera, or none, is what happens
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.780]   when they begin to change individually.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.220]   Can the relationship expand enough to broaden the envelope,
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.820]   to let these two people emerge individually,
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.340]   or is the jacket too tight?
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.420]   Is the vest too tight?
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.100]   And often it becomes a bit of a crisis,
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.100]   because they grew together on the basis of this togetherness.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:42.900]   And sometimes they can, and sometimes it just feels like,
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.100]   that in order to become adults,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.220]   it may need to happen with a different partner.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.820]   And that's why I always say, I think this moment,
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.540]   we have two or three relationships or marriages
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.180]   in our adult lives in the West.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.500]   And some of us will do it with the same person,
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.780]   but the relationship has to change.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:07.180]   It's like the person changes the relationship,
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.020]   but the relationship makes room for the person to change.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.980]   This is dynamic.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.260]   - That just feels like such a true statement to me,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.580]   because in my professional life
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.980]   as a developmental neurobiologist, there's a saying,
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.460]   people always think of development and then adulthood,
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.300]   but all of life is one big developmental arc.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.140]   - That's absolutely correct.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.780]   - And the great psychologist, Erickson,
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.940]   spoke about the different sort of challenges
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.980]   that people face from birth all the way until death,
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.820]   which, you know, nowadays hopefully will extend
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.020]   into people's 80s, 90s, or even beyond.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.540]   - Well, his last stage is the generative stage.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.100]   It's actually an amazing, I mean,
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.020]   he's the most articulate theoretician of stages of life.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.860]   - I agree.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.060]   If people haven't seen those stages,
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.780]   we'll put a link to them in the show note captions,
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.620]   but the idea is that you're basically grappling
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.060]   with some basic struggle that you either reconcile
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.300]   or you don't at every stage.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.820]   So you could imagine that these,
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.340]   let's say these three marriages,
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.820]   let's imagine a couple that meets in their 20s
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.780]   and does three marriages,
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.780]   which implies a couple of divorces in between,
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.740]   maybe not legal divorces, across their lifespan.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.140]   They really are,
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.340]   according to the Erickson theory of development
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.940]   or any neurobiological examination of brain development,
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.980]   different people in their 20s versus 40s,
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.780]   versus 60s, 70s, 80s.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.380]   So this notion of three different marriages
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.060]   to me seems both logical and very grounded
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.100]   in what we know about the biology of the brain and the self.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.940]   So-
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.940]   - A good metaphor is rooted in science.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.540]   - And yet it's also kind of a radical idea
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.940]   when one hears it for the first time.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.460]   It framed in the context of with the same person,
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.380]   it sounds kind of lovely and romantic.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.740]   Okay, they meet, it's lovely.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.780]   They have their first marriage.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.220]   Then there's some challenge, they overcome,
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.100]   they do a second marriage.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.660]   Then some challenge and a third marriage.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.540]   And maybe there's even grandchildren, you imagine,
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.500]   maybe even great grandchildren.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.020]   There's all this kind of romantic notions
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.340]   built up around it.
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.620]   But then there's also the reality that for many people,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.460]   more than half, there's a fracture of the first marriage
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.820]   and that they either remain single or marry again.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.260]   And so what do you think dictates whether or not a person
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.020]   can go through these series of evolutions
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.700]   and actually find and create love again and again and again,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.580]   either with the same person or with someone new,
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.740]   or in some cases, I guess, three different partners?
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.860]   I mean, what is the sort of requirement?
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.260]   Is it a willingness to accept this model
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.340]   and understand that who they are at 50
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.300]   is going to be very different
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.460]   than who they were in their 20s?
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.900]   - You know, a good question
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.580]   is a question that has many answers.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.540]   There's different ways to answer this.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.420]   I think that more than thinking about it
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.420]   as they were able to overcome crises,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.660]   it's really the ability to redefine oneself
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.300]   and to redefine the relationship.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.060]   It's much more creative than problem solving.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.140]   You can overcome a crisis and put it aside
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.500]   and stay the same.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.100]   This is much more of a generative experience.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.460]   It's a creative experience,
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.380]   is that you actually become a different unit.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.220]   The power dynamic is different.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.220]   The interdependence is different.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.540]   The erotic charge is different.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.340]   The connection to the outside world is different.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.940]   It's really, it's enlivening.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.500]   I think everybody understands the difference
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.940]   between a relationship that is not dead
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.860]   and a relationship that is alive.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:42.660]   I am not there to help people survive.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.660]   My work is about more than that.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.020]   It's about helping people to feel alive.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.980]   And the redefinition of having the same relationship
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.740]   with the same person, it has to be alive,
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.700]   not just not dead.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.140]   And if sometimes that alive means recreating a new,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.780]   you know, going to a new person,
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.740]   a new country, a new city, a new social circle,
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.740]   a new profession, a new a lot of things
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.260]   that we today have access to change,
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.020]   things that people did once.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.180]   You know, when I ask an audience,
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.060]   if your grandparents grew up in the same neighborhood
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.180]   or in the same town and worked in the same company,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.940]   I mean, most people raise their hands.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.860]   And then I go down the generations.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.940]   And then now it's like, how many of you
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.980]   have had three jobs in the last five years?
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.740]   So this notion that we can create new things for ourselves
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.700]   is actually one of the greatest things
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.020]   that has happened in the realm of relationships.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.260]   We can have kids much later.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.700]   We can join somebody who has already had those children.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.500]   We can marry in our 60s for the first time.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.260]   We can live in a threesome.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.660]   We can, there's a plasticity,
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.820]   if you want to use a word that you,
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.060]   to the world of relationship today
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.620]   that is extremely rich and expansive,
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.180]   but demands a set of skills to negotiate,
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.900]   to understand the uncertainty
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.460]   that comes from having to make so many decisions.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.260]   At the time we, in the past,
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.100]   none of us made decisions about most of these things.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.180]   They were handed down to us.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.100]   So that level of freedom is utterly rich,
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.540]   but comes with a tremendous amount of anxiety
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.820]   and demands maturity.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:36.260]   And sometimes couples have become so entrenched
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.900]   and so locked in their story
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.860]   and confusing their story with the truth
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.900]   and feeling that they're living next to someone
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.500]   who has a completely different version of the story
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.020]   that they cannot talk to.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.140]   Like there is no greater polarization
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.860]   sometimes than a couple that once agreed on a lot of things
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.580]   that you just think there's no way
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.780]   change can enter this system.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.780]   - Okay, so when I hear your answer,
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.100]   what comes to mind is that, again, as a neurobiologist,
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.860]   I think the brain, the human brain has this amazing capacity
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.720]   to focus on past, present, or future.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.260]   And sometimes two of those three things,
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.360]   it's kind of hard to think about all three at once,
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   but it sounds to me as if one of the more functional
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.100]   attributes that somebody can have
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.980]   if they want to navigate relationship in a healthy way
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.900]   is to be able to at least temporarily
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.020]   discard with one's story about one's past
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.780]   and even their past identity.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.100]   And the word that was coming up over and over again
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.580]   in my mind as you answered was this word you used earlier,
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.460]   which was curiosity.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.100]   And I'm wondering if what you're referring to
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.900]   is a curiosity on the part of hopefully both people
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.700]   in the relationship as to what the relationship could become
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.300]   and who oneself could become.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.900]   And my definition of curiosity is an interest
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.540]   in finding out but without an emotional attachment
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.320]   to what the outcome is.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.180]   This is what we train scientists to do.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.500]   You want to get the answers,
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.340]   but you can't get emotionally attached
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.260]   to the answer being A or B.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.740]   That's anti-curiosity.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.900]   Real genuine curiosity is about the process,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.820]   the verb action of wanting to figure out something,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.900]   but not being attached to a particular outcome.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.020]   And as you were describing sort of functional trajectory
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.580]   of relationship, I was thinking, okay,
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.380]   so if one could approach relationship
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.780]   with a willingness to discard kind of stories
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.600]   about one's past and maybe even a sense
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.380]   of one's identity of past,
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.740]   be willing to let go of that a little bit
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.700]   and just be curious about like, where could this go
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.100]   if I let the relationship guide
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.500]   my evolution of identity a bit?
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.100]   And that takes some, as you said, some boldness,
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.220]   because if it's kind of scary, right?
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.500]   If you not knowing who one is going to become,
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.880]   if they let the other person, you know,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.740]   maybe lead for a while or if they were to lead for a while,
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.020]   are these the sorts of dynamics that you're referring to?
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.860]   - I think you almost articulated
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.420]   one of the most important pieces of my work.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:19.020]   I mean, curiosity is one of the top words for me
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.820]   because it stands in opposition to reactivity.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.420]   Reactivity reinforces the cycle.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.760]   It just creates narrow repetition,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.920]   rapid cycles of escalation.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.400]   It usually involves defense and attack and blame, et cetera.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.520]   Curiosity is an active engagement with the unknown.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.680]   And I like when you say without the attachment
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.800]   to the outcome or the emotional investment,
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.840]   I think that's absolutely accurate.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.360]   And much of what I do is try to have people
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.440]   switch from reactive to curious.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.500]   But that curiosity means that they're willing to enter
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.240]   empathically and respectfully
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.040]   into the realm of another person
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.720]   whose narrative is completely different.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.000]   I'm very invested and familiar with the neurosciences
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.860]   and the whole work on the brain in relationships,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.440]   but I am very interested in narrative
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.520]   because I believe that the story shapes the experience.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.880]   And when people hold on to the story
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.600]   and they don't think it's a story, they think it's fact.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.460]   This is what happened last night.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.680]   I'll tell you what you did.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.520]   I'll tell you what happened.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.880]   That's not the case.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.800]   And they don't see this as a subjective rendering.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.640]   It's totally valid, but it's valid as your experience.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.180]   And much of couples' conversations is pseudo-factual talk,
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.440]   but it is actually subjective.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.760]   Once you get that, you can become curious.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.020]   Once you are curious, you open up.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.320]   But it is very challenging when people are hurt,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   wounded, defensive, holding tight to invite that curiosity.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:09.600]   What's happening in their bodies
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.480]   is about shutdown and defense and self-protection.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.880]   And you want, I'm doing this physically to you
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.600]   because this is where the brain and the neurobiology
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.280]   in that moment is going against
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.320]   what actually is in their best interest,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.740]   psychologically and existentially.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.880]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.520]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.080]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.200]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.640]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.720]   all of your foundational nutritional needs
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.860]   and it tastes great.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.600]   Now, I've been drinking AG1 since 2012.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.040]   And I started doing that at a time
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.520]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.400]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.720]   to purchase one supplement.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.760]   And I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.880]   The reason for that is even though I strive
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.920]   to eat most of my foods from whole foods
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.680]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.400]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits, vegetables,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.320]   vitamins and minerals, micronutrients
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.560]   and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.480]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.280]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.720]   I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.240]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.920]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.640]   my physical health, my mental health
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.720]   and my performance, both cognitive and physical are better.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.540]   I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG1
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.400]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.420]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.480]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.000]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.440]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.600]   and again later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.740]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.200]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.280]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.660]   to claim a special offer.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.920]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.480]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.960]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.880]   to claim that special offer.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.120]   - I am a firm believer that when we are in a stress response
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.920]   that we become locked in a time domain
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.880]   and not to spin off into a tangent about this,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.720]   but put differently when we are relaxed,
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.560]   we can think about time and our life
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.160]   and other things happening around us
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.560]   and others in a far more dynamic way.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   The stress response is about solving for the feeling now.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.000]   It has no sense about,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.200]   or it doesn't allow us a window into the cognition
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.300]   or emotions that are related to what could be,
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.120]   even though we desperately want out of there.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.880]   And there's all sorts of evolutionary reasons
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.840]   why this would be the case.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.680]   - Of course.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.120]   I feel like a statement that you made,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.100]   which is that a curiosity and a willing to discard
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.600]   with one's own narratives.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.040]   And in particular, what you said about
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.140]   that people perceive their own experience as fact,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.240]   when in actuality, it's just two different stories.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.520]   Neither person is correct or one person,
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.880]   but people have these stories
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.720]   which are almost confabulation at some point,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.560]   but they feel so true to all of us when we experience them.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.360]   I also feel like that's a lot of what's happening
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.680]   in culture at large.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.120]   Diametrically opposed camps really believe
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.480]   that the same thing is a reflection
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.720]   of two completely different series of facts.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.160]   And it seems almost unsolvable at the level of culture.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.500]   There's just too many people,
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.160]   but at the level of two individuals,
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.640]   I feel like it ought to be tractable.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.120]   - You know, I have gone to a lot of meetings
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.360]   in the last year on issues of polarization,
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.040]   on societal levels.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.160]   And I often think like, what is a psychologist
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.280]   or a couple therapist doing in those meetings?
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.400]   Why am I invited here?
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   And then I think, you know what?
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.840]   You actually have a lot of experience with polarizations.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.560]   Sitting for a long time with couples
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.900]   who once actually thought in the presence of the other,
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   I discover myself, now can be so at odds.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.480]   They're sitting in the same room.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.220]   They're listening to the same session.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.500]   They have a complete different interpretation
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.360]   of what I said and what it meant.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.720]   And they leave and you wonder,
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.680]   did it happen in the same room?
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.480]   And the same thing is about what they describe
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.720]   about the night before.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.220]   It's like, and if you didn't see them together
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.760]   and you saw them each alone,
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.240]   you would be completely mistaken.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.280]   Because it's like Swiss cheese.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.040]   Everything that one has left out
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.920]   is where the other one starts.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.400]   So we learn a lot from doing couples work
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.200]   around the process of polarization,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.840]   around the process of intractable conflict,
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.160]   around the sense that you are my enemy
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.000]   and there is nothing in what you say
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.900]   that I can recognize or be empathic towards
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.880]   or understanding.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.800]   I think on a societal level,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.840]   the people who have studied intractable conflict
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:10.540]   basically have a method of how you bring
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:15.440]   two opposing parties, factions, tribes,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   who have been in conflict and at war for a long time
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.800]   and how you bring them together.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.760]   There is actually a method, a process.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.840]   It's not written in stone,
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.920]   but you certainly don't start by talking
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.000]   about the things that drive you completely apart
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.400]   and unable to talk to each other.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.900]   You start by finding some elements of your shared humanity.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:47.440]   In a couple, 'cause that is the space we talk about now,
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.180]   in a couple, it's an incredible thing
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.640]   how people can literally think
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.920]   that the other person wants their demise.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.940]   You live day in, day out with someone
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:02.940]   who you really think wants to hurt you, is your enemy.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.640]   Sometimes there is evil.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.960]   There's people who don't have good intentions,
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.960]   but in many situations, it's also a projection.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.000]   It's also experiences that you've had in the past.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.280]   And this is where what's interesting
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.880]   is that the narrative, the conscious narrative,
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.480]   lives here and what you call the brain
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.160]   that can only locate itself in three temporal,
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.280]   in the brain and the physiology are in a different time.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.320]   Implicit memory is completely influencing
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.600]   explicit narrative.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.720]   - Yeah, people are incredibly prone to confabulation
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.080]   based on these unconscious things going on.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.680]   And it's kind of a scary thought.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.160]   - If I feel it, this is what's happening.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.840]   - That's right, right.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.200]   - And because we are creatures of meaning,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.120]   we need to reconcile those things
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.760]   and we need coherence in our narratives.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.000]   And that coherence is what is so difficult
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.200]   for when you work with people who are,
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.120]   what is it that they're holding on to?
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.600]   I mean, you know, one of the classic examples is some,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.300]   you know, someone says, I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.640]   And the other one says, that's not the case.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.840]   You know, like if someone tells you,
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.240]   I didn't mean to hurt you,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.240]   you would think that someone would say,
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.760]   ah, that's reassuring.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.000]   I like to hear that.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.760]   I hope that's true, makes me feel a lot better.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.680]   Rather than proving to you that that's not true,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.520]   you wanted to step on my toes,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.440]   you intentionally put those heels on
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:41.440]   or those shoes or, you know, those fists to step on me.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:46.020]   And that coherence of maintaining the idea
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.920]   that if I feel that you hurt me,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.680]   you must have been wanting to hurt me
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.760]   rather than, you know, I can be hurt
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.360]   and that doesn't mean you intentionally
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.760]   were trying to do anything.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.800]   It's as if I need to justify my being hurt
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.120]   by the intention of what you did.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.040]   And to just make sure, sometimes that's the case.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.720]   It's not that there are people
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.200]   who intentionally want to hurt some people.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.680]   But at other times, what I'm highlighting is that
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.800]   the coherence to make sense of why I'm feeling this way
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.760]   demands that I also define what you are trying to do to me.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.160]   - I mean, and in reality,
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.360]   most people are terrible at understanding
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.840]   how they themselves feel,
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.680]   let alone someone else's intentions.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.840]   I mean, if somebody apologizes and says,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.560]   "Listen, I'm truly sorry, I screwed up."
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.440]   And the other person says, "I don't believe you."
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.600]   I think what they're really saying,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.780]   you can tell me if I'm wrong,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.840]   is I don't feel better as a consequence of your apology.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.940]   - That's because your apology, I screwed up is incomplete.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:51.900]   - Hmm.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.540]   - Most of the time, people say that I made a mistake,
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.060]   I'm sorry, but it doesn't acknowledge
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.020]   what the other person felt in response to what we did.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.140]   - So let's say that the apology also includes that,
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.820]   I, you know, I really messed up.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.100]   It makes total sense that you would be upset.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.300]   You know, we had an agreement that we would meet at seven
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.340]   and I didn't get home until nine
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.220]   and I didn't notify you until eight.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.840]   I would be upset too, that's totally justified.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.560]   That sucks, that's got to really suck.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:33.660]   At that point, if the other person still feels like,
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.740]   it's still frustrating,
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:41.700]   presumably it's because either this is a pattern.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.060]   So this one apology doesn't encapsulate all the other,
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.520]   the sort of a litany of other things that relate to this,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.420]   the feeling unseen or unappreciated,
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.500]   or, you know, there's often a lot more behind the event.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.340]   - You've apologized many times.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.180]   - Right, or yeah, it could be a pattern of apologies
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.980]   that don't equate to change,
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.220]   or it could be a pattern of an apology
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.580]   that doesn't encapsulate all the other things
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.820]   that weren't voiced.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.180]   Because sometimes people won't voice their grievances
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.300]   because they, for whatever reason,
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.580]   but there's a lot of resent that's built up, right?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:17.940]   So in that moment, when somebody tells another
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.940]   that they are not convinced, emotionally convinced,
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.840]   what are the tools that you give each
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.440]   in order to be able to navigate that sticking point?
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.120]   - I think apology is an amazing topic
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.560]   in the realm of relationship.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.240]   It's a huge piece.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.080]   Apology, forgiveness, ownership, responsibility,
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.680]   accountability, that whole range of things.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.880]   I think if you give that apology, many times somebody,
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.400]   and it's not that you're doing this every Tuesday,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.360]   the person will probably just say, thank you.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:58.480]   If you have someone who can't receive an apology
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.000]   and the apology is sincere,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.120]   that's the first and foremost thing
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.800]   that accompanies an apology,
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.080]   then you begin to ask,
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.080]   why is this person struggling to receive this?
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.240]   Because it is the thing that you should be getting.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:22.040]   And then you start to ask yourself,
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:29.320]   is it because if I accept your apology,
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.400]   it's as if I agree that what you did wasn't so bad.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.740]   It is repairable.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.880]   And in order to really make clear that the grievance is big,
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.020]   I cannot receive your apology.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.480]   That's one of the dynamics that often occurs in that moment.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.200]   And so you ask sometimes, you sit and you see,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   you see somebody who pretends to say, I'm sorry.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.520]   You see somebody who just says,
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.280]   come on, what's the big deal?
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.760]   And then you see people who really are sincere.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.280]   And then you watch what's happening to the other person.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.120]   Are they relieved?
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.200]   Are they suspicious?
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.640]   Are they feeling like they would dissolve
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   a certain element of their identity
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.760]   if they don't hold on to this?
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.920]   Is it as if they're saying, you can get away with it?
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.000]   It's not as bad because accepting the apology
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.760]   is to minimize the issue.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.280]   And then you switch to burn on the other side.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   You know, in Judaism, you apologize three times.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.480]   And if after the third time,
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.680]   and you've done a real reckoning apology,
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.080]   if at the three time, the other person does not accept it,
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.220]   the burden passes over to the other person.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.120]   - Interesting.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.200]   - This is my money this.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.240]   And I think it's an incredibly interesting idea
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.480]   that at some point, the person has made the amends
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.040]   when they have.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.520]   And when you cannot receive it,
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.860]   then now the burden passes on you.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.320]   - I'm just gonna hover there for a second
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.880]   because I agree that apology is such an interesting
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.820]   and important concept.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.380]   And you mentioned that accepting somebody's apology
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.480]   at an emotional level, not just saying,
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.780]   thank you, I accept your apology,
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.400]   but really internalizing that
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.360]   and allowing space for it to shift your experience
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.100]   of the thing that hurt.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.800]   - And by the way, accepting the apology
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.280]   doesn't yet mean that you forgive.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.480]   Forgive is your freedom.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.400]   You decide at what point you do it,
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.080]   and you may do it alone.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.640]   It's not always a dyadic experience.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.760]   Apology is a dyadic experience, but forgiveness is freedom.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.800]   - Yeah, I appreciate that distinction
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.640]   now that you've given it.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.620]   I mean, I appreciate you giving that distinction.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:48.800]   I did not make that distinction before.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.720]   - I love this topic because it's so,
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.160]   it's really so many things happen underneath.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.440]   You know, there's issues of shame around apology.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.820]   What's the difference between shame and responsibility?
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.880]   What is the capacity of a person to have real distress
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.400]   rather than empathic distress?
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.000]   Real empathy rather than empathic distress.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   And so it's a portal into a lot of things, you know.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.880]   There are people who can never apologize.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.720]   - Is that right?
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.540]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.480]   - Because to do so would what for them?
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.800]   - Shame.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.040]   I think a lot of that piece is around shame.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.820]   It's not, I'm a, because self-esteem,
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.760]   as my friend Terry Real says,
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.480]   is your ability to see yourself as a flawed individual
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.840]   and still hold yourself in high regard.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.720]   When you admit you're flawed,
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.920]   it means there's something wrong with you.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.980]   Then it's very hard to say, I'm sorry.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.040]   This is the essence.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.400]   How do you see yourself as imperfect, flawed,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.960]   but you still respect yourself
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.560]   and you hold yourself in high regard?
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.080]   If you can do those two things,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   you can apologize very easily.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:05.040]   - I find that so much of being an "adult," again, in quotes.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.480]   - Yes, yes, you would hope.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   - Involves the disambiguating two things.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:19.320]   One is we're taught to really trust our own experience
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.680]   to some extent, to stand our ground
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:26.380]   when we know A is true and B is false.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.080]   But then also part of being an adult
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.820]   is admitting when we're wrong.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.820]   And there's no rule book, no real-time rule book for that,
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.920]   especially given that people have different versions
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.040]   of the same thing often.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:46.040]   But it seems to me that one of the great challenges
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.360]   in not just in romantic relationship,
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.360]   but in relationships of all kinds
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.120]   is to really be able to slow down
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.000]   and enter the state of mind and body
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.820]   that allows us to do the kind of processing
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:58.860]   you're talking about.
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.960]   So at a very practical level, I'm curious,
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.600]   let's say a couple comes into your office
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.160]   and they're dealing with either a single hurt
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.100]   or a litany of hurts or something like that.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.360]   Do you believe it's important for them
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.320]   to shift out of their emotional state
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.640]   to be able to process differently?
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.000]   Do you have them, at the beginning of a session,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.320]   do you have them do a couple deep breaths together?
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.660]   Do you have them recall a time
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.640]   when they felt particularly bonded?
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.120]   Is there an effort to shift their somatic state
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.640]   in order to bring their mind to a place of more curiosity
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.400]   or is going straight to the issue often the best way in?
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.080]   - First of all, I like that we,
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.240]   that it's interesting we're going from apology to conflict.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.580]   It makes total sense.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.400]   I spent the last year creating a whole course on conflict
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   and how do you turn conflict into connection?
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.240]   What is good conflict?
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.680]   You know, I think conflict is inherent to relationships.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.700]   And then what are problematic ways to deal with conflict?
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.700]   Yes, on some level there is very little you can hear
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.600]   if you are in a state of hyperarousal,
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.360]   if you are in a position of self-protection.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.940]   I mean, all these stressful places,
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.880]   all these cortisol levels going up, et cetera,
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.200]   are not gonna help you.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.940]   But at the same time, you can't,
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:21.900]   in the moment that someone is completely agitated,
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.880]   talk with them about trusting.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.000]   I mean, it's just like the physiology is not corresponding.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.760]   So it's a real dance.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.080]   I don't do the breath often, sometimes.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.360]   I mean, I actually don't do anything all the time.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.160]   I am working like a tailor.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.280]   I do fittings.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.040]   I mean, I think the richness of therapies
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.160]   is in its art on some level, maybe.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.440]   But sometimes I just say,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.140]   "I think you need to stand up and move
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.520]   "and just listen to what your partner has to say,
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.340]   "but don't sit."
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.480]   Sometimes I say, "Don't look at each other."
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.740]   Sometimes I say, "Turn to each other."
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.420]   Some things are better done face-to-face
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.180]   and some things are better done side-by-side,
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.400]   you know, parallel play, fishing.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.880]   There's a lot of, like, you know, driving.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.200]   Every parent who's ever had a kid in the back knows this.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.300]   You don't, you have both.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.800]   You have moments when you need to be able
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   to look into each other,
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.480]   and then you have moments where you just need to do this,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.160]   something about the side-by-side.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.880]   Then it's also the limits of words.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.480]   When is it important to talk?
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.060]   And when, you know, we're talking
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.820]   because we are homo sapiens,
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.320]   but in fact, if we were animals,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.800]   we would be just making noises.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.160]   We're not really making sense.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.200]   So stop talking.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:50.420]   So what I try very hard to do
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:55.420]   is to not let people show the worst side of themselves.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.020]   They can do that at home.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:00.700]   They don't need to come and shame themselves in my office.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.080]   And I do know that certain situations
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.900]   will draw the worst out of people,
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.540]   but that doesn't mean that that's who they are.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.940]   And that's one of the big things as a therapist
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.940]   is to not fall for that.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.740]   And just, because if you met these people alone,
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.820]   they would be charming.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.800]   And if you had met them maybe two years before,
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.320]   they would have been charming too.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.940]   So something's happening between them
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.100]   that is making them act and react
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.660]   from places of deep hurt and fear and attack
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.080]   and all of that, and aggression.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.120]   And sometimes I see them alone.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.920]   I don't think that you are capable
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.120]   of having this conversation at this moment
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.720]   because you're not willing to take any responsibility
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.160]   when you're sitting next to your partner.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.800]   You're in a blame fest and we're not going to do that.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.680]   So I'm going to talk with you alone.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.720]   And then I'm going to prepare you to come to your partner
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.780]   with at least one or two things that you can own.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:58.800]   What am I doing to contribute to this mess?
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.380]   Or what am I doing to make things better?
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.200]   I like to start the session by asking,
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.520]   what did you, and if I'm dealing with a kind
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.640]   of chronic conflict, low intensity warfare, or bigger,
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.560]   it depends what kind, there's different kinds of conflict.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.600]   But I like to ask, what have you done this week
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.360]   to make things better?
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.200]   - What a great question.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.400]   - What have you done to make your partner feel
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.360]   that they matter?
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.520]   Rather than what happened this week?
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.080]   You know, I kind of have a sense.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.720]   Please do not tell me the last unraveling.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.680]   You know, I got it.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.500]   It goes from one, from zero to 60 in no time.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.500]   And none of this, I don't need the details of the story.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.880]   I need to know what you're doing to each other.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.280]   What feelings you're instigating in each other.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.960]   I don't need the plot.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:52.200]   The plot is, you know, there's only three dances.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.760]   This fight, you know, aiming at each other,
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.480]   withdrawing from each other, or one person withdrawing
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.960]   and one person pursuing.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:05.280]   These are three types of major choreographies of conflict.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.000]   Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya, or psst, quiet silence,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.460]   or one goes after the other who is closing the doors
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.460]   and they follow them through the house,
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.840]   which is following them to a lot of other things.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.180]   And from that place on, you decide, okay,
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.620]   who is doing what to whom?
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.940]   Who is feeling what at the hands of whom?
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.460]   How, what is influencing this?
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.880]   You know, this person is once again feeling
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.620]   that when this one didn't talk to them,
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.820]   they were being given the silent treatment
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.140]   that they used to feel when they grow up.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:44.140]   And this feeling of neglect and dismissal
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:47.180]   is just crushing them 'cause they suddenly feel
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.620]   like they've been rejected completely.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.100]   And this one is feeling like they're once again
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.660]   being attacked and invaded by this other person
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.820]   who keeps following them and wants to talk
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.660]   when they have nothing.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.840]   And is remembering when they were living in the place
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.580]   where they grew up, where they couldn't wait to get out
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.580]   because they were feeling completely flooded
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.660]   and overwhelmed by the shit show of their house.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.980]   And these two stories are now dictating what's happening
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.460]   between these two people.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.820]   These two people are no longer adults in the room.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.500]   Their younger selves have completely taken over.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.860]   Their amygdala is completely flooded.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:25.340]   And then it matters, it depends.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:29.420]   Sometimes because I'm a little bit narrative driven,
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.540]   I may make the mistake to actually go to the story
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.240]   when in fact these two people really put,
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.820]   sometimes I sit for 10 minutes quiet.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.300]   I say, we're gonna just wait for our systems to regulate
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.440]   'cause even I get agitated.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.140]   It's not like I don't absorb it.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.900]   I say, I think we need some sitting here.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.460]   Sometimes I put music.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.780]   I love music, so I put music.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.900]   I just say, I don't think a single word
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.040]   is gonna help here.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.180]   Sometimes I say, I think we should stop the session.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.860]   I mean, it depends.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.900]   If you think there's something that can be gained,
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.820]   if you start to feel like it's just gonna make it worse.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:17.380]   And sometimes I, in the middle of the session may say,
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.780]   when's the last time you made him a cup of tea?
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:25.020]   And the fact that you can still make a cup of tea
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.180]   to someone who you would like to strangle,
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.060]   it's really special.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.300]   It's amazing how we can inhabit
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:36.180]   two completely contradictory feelings at the same time.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.100]   I can't stand you, get me the hell out of here
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.980]   and I can't imagine my life without you.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.880]   Those things coexist, love and hate side by side.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.700]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.380]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.020]   I recently became a Function member
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.300]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.340]   to lab testing.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.260]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.220]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.860]   for analyzing blood, urine and saliva
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.740]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.500]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.780]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:15.220]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.940]   Function not only provides testing
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.380]   of over a hundred biomarkers
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.060]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.900]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.460]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.320]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.440]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.740]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.540]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.420]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.900]   but offered medical doctor informed insights
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.580]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.900]   which included limiting my tuna consumption
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.660]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.020]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.920]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.980]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:57.740]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.300]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.720]   is so important for health.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.500]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.420]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:06.920]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.820]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.340]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.060]   as well as how comprehensive
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.420]   and how actionable the tests are,
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:16.660]   that I recently joined their advisory board
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.900]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.220]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.500]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.100]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.700]   but they're offering early access
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:29.940]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:33.220]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.460]   to get early access to Function.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.460]   There's something that I really want to revisit
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.900]   that you said.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.040]   You said it incredibly clearly,
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.140]   but I have never heard this described.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.860]   And I think it's so, so very important
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.740]   for people to hear and internalize,
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.000]   including me, that I'm gonna ask us to visit it again,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.540]   but not because you weren't clear,
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.380]   but just because I think-
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.820]   - No, I'm curious, what is it?
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.700]   - So as a biologist, when we teach biology,
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.700]   the good biologists, good teachers,
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.580]   we emphasize names only because people need to know them.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.020]   This is called that, this is called that,
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.300]   but it's all about verbs.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.660]   It's all about processes and dynamics.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.020]   And what you just described
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:19.020]   as the three verb states of conflict,
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.160]   I think I've never heard articulated that way.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:26.540]   - So you described, if I understand it correctly-
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.380]   - Pursuer, pursuer.
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.220]   - Right, either one person pursuing another.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.780]   - No, pursuer, pursuer is where people go at each other.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.620]   - Oh, pursuer, pursuer is loggerheads.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:35.380]   - And those are escalations.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.700]   - Okay, two arrows pointing at one another.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.540]   - Two arrows, yes.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.460]   - And not in a good way.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.740]   - No, not in conflict, it's usually not at a good way.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:47.500]   And there's a whole interpretation of an attachment style
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:51.820]   that underlies why do people in the situation of threat
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.360]   go on the attack?
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.680]   You have two people fighting,
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.280]   you have two people flighting, fleeing,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.360]   and you have one person who flees
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.560]   and one person who fights.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.100]   That's another language for pursuer, pursuer,
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.920]   distancer, distancer, pursuer, distancer.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.280]   - And in each of those cases,
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.640]   it seems that the first step
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.760]   to getting to a more functional dynamic
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.280]   to try and sort this out, whatever the conflict is,
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.720]   is to somehow change one's mindset
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:31.360]   from talking about the story of what led there
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.840]   or stories of what led there
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   to really starting to parse the feeling states of ourselves
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.160]   and hopefully empathy for the feeling state of the other.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.680]   - It's feeling states and physiological states.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.760]   It's two different things.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.360]   The physiology is more primitive, more basic.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:55.360]   It's physiology, senses, feelings, thoughts,
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.600]   is the way I would, you know,
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.320]   but because we, I say it, you know,
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.180]   because we are homo sapiens and we think,
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.280]   we really, this thing about coherence
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.040]   and thinking that what we say has meaning
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:13.800]   is extremely powerful to the point sometimes of delusional,
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.880]   you know, 'cause I have to believe this
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.880]   because there would be too much dissonance
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.720]   if what I feel and what I think
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.560]   and what therefore happened
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.520]   didn't all have a coherence to themselves.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.640]   And, you know, sometimes when you see it in the room,
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.120]   you kind of say, they never said that.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.920]   - Yeah, it's almost like a psychosis of sorts.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.640]   I'm not calling either person psychotic, but.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.280]   - It's psychotic because it's a disconnection from reality.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.680]   I would say it's such an inhabiting
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.920]   of an internal reality that it is disconnected
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.000]   from the possibility, and this is where curiosity comes in.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.360]   It's the possibility that what you are experiencing
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.160]   is completely real in its experience,
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.880]   but that doesn't mean it is factual
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:08.000]   or it is real in reality, you know?
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   And to, when I'm hurt and when I am thinking
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:19.500]   that you want to harm me, it's very difficult for me
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:25.840]   in that moment to be willing to be empathic towards you.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.480]   And there are relationships where this is the truth.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.360]   I want to constantly come back to that
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.720]   because not everything is imagined.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.140]   - Sure. - You know?
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.020]   But there are many other relationships
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:43.020]   where why would, why, you know,
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:48.080]   why would he want, maybe he stepped away
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.700]   because he just thought that whatever was gonna come out
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.740]   of his mouth, he would regret.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.140]   It's not because he doesn't care about you.
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:59.320]   In factually, it's the opposite.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.860]   And he knows what he can sometimes say,
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.380]   he, they, she, it doesn't matter,
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.740]   but not because he wanted to just throw you to the wolves.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.060]   - It's almost like we lose our theory of mind,
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:15.700]   our ability to place ourselves in the mind of another
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.340]   in a healthy way when we're in these stress states.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.180]   I'm curious.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.100]   - It's funny you call it stress states
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.700]   because stress to me is so physiological
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.420]   that it doesn't include the relational component.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.260]   - Sure.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.260]   - I mean, there needs to be a word for stress
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.380]   that involves the emotional reality
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.420]   and that emotional reality that now
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.920]   may be somewhat imagined, and this is why it's complicated,
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.480]   was once true.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.500]   What now is an internal truth.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.020]   Once was what really happened.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.380]   And that's why we imagine,
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.100]   and this is how we interpret the dynamic.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.920]   It's very important to add that.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.140]   So the past was real.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.620]   There was someone in the past who actually did this to me.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.660]   But when you do this, I think of them,
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.840]   I bring those two things together.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.840]   I collapse the past and the present.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.300]   And that's why I'm convinced
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.660]   this is what you're doing to me too.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:20.340]   And so how do you take somebody out of their physical
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.020]   and mental and emotional past
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.860]   to be grounding themselves into the present
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.320]   so that they can consider that this person
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.620]   that is next to them is not doing to them
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.460]   what once was done to them.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.220]   - Right, and my mind immediately goes to
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.300]   what you just described as a shift from focusing
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.280]   mainly on the past and how it's making us feel
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.020]   in the present to how we're feeling in the present.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.860]   Acknowledging and understanding something did happen.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.440]   That was real, as you said.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.260]   And yet with this curious eye toward the future
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.300]   of what could unfold.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:59.300]   - That's probably the hardest nugget of couples therapy.
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.300]   I mean, I do individual work too,
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.580]   but if we talk relational therapy,
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.020]   this is one of those nuggets
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:11.020]   because people are not aware that they are in their past.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.040]   They are convinced that this is in the present.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.140]   It's a collapse of time zones and realities.
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.840]   It's what makes us so rich.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.680]   It's what makes us so able to be creative and artful,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.740]   but it's what sometimes makes it very challenging for us,
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.020]   especially in romantic relationships.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:31.860]   'Cause you asked,
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.300]   at first you began with romantic relationships.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.620]   A lot of what we say here is true
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.860]   for friendships and work relationships,
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.140]   but there is only two relationships that mirror each other.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.100]   It's the one we had with our first caretakers,
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.420]   mostly our parents,
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.360]   and the ones we have with our romantic partners.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.020]   People can sit in the office and tell you,
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.860]   "I don't have this with anybody else."
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.140]   And it's true, often.
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.300]   You believe them.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.220]   Because nobody gets as close to you
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:05.220]   and nobody elicits in you those kinds of early yearnings
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:09.900]   and emotional needs than a romantic partner.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.000]   And that is very interesting.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.100]   - I don't know if it's a bug or a feature,
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.180]   as the engineers say,
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.140]   but it is remarkable to me
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:23.740]   that the very same neural machinery
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.500]   that forms the underpinning
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.060]   of infant primary caretaker relationship
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.020]   is repurposed for romantic relationship.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.460]   I mean, I marvel at that.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.300]   - Interesting. - Right?
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.780]   I mean, the brain doesn't have like,
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.820]   "Oh, here's your developmental wiring circuits."
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.640]   And then guess what?
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.460]   You get to hit adolescence and you go through puberty,
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.660]   and then you get this new circuit
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.580]   for forming a romantic attachment.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.420]   - It's the same one.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.700]   - The brain imaging shows us that it's repurposed.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.460]   So it's like if you got a two plus two equals four
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.860]   algorithm in that circuit,
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.420]   let's call that securely attached,
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.820]   although I realize that language is not sufficient,
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.260]   but for just purposes of discussion.
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.180]   Okay, well then great.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.420]   Then you get healthy romantic attachments as adults
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:03.860]   or you as an adult,
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.980]   and perhaps you can navigate in and out of things
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.580]   that are unhealthy more quickly.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.800]   However, if you got a two plus two equals five algorithm
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.460]   wired into that circuit,
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.020]   well, then you're forever looking for something
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.580]   that is essentially dysfunctional.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.420]   That's the simplest version of this.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.780]   - Tell me more about this repurposing.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.860]   - Yeah. - It's really interesting.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.660]   - Yeah, so beautiful work by Alan Shore
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.540]   and others has shown- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.940]   - It's work I know you're familiar with,
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.340]   has shown that you image the brain of infant
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.540]   and typically it's mother,
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.460]   but they've done other caretakers as well.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.780]   And you see this incredible mirroring of,
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.500]   sure, right brain, left brain activity,
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.740]   more dopaminergic or serotonergic activity.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.820]   Basically the takeaway is that you see a lot of coherence.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.060]   What's going on in the mother
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.820]   is going on in the child and vice versa.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:50.980]   And there's a lot of reciprocity.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.300]   But sometimes in unhealthy caretaker infant relationships,
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.740]   the so-called anxious, attached, dissociative,
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:01.980]   or avoidant type scenarios, the ABCD baby type thing.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.780]   People can look that up.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.580]   If they like, we can provide a link.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.540]   You see a mismatch in the neurochemistry
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.660]   and the activation of these brain areas.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.100]   In other words, the brain circuitry for attachment
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.620]   is set up so that anxious states are evoked
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:20.380]   when calm states should have been.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.220]   Have there been better parenting?
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:22.660]   - Yes, yes, yes. - Okay, all right.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.820]   But then you take those,
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.180]   you essentially run the same sorts of studies
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:33.180]   on romantically attached young adults or older adults.
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.940]   And what you see is it's the same sets of neurons,
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.380]   the same circuits.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.460]   I mean, this is remarkable.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.640]   Nowhere else, to my awareness,
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.500]   nowhere else in the nervous system
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   do we repurpose neural circuitry from early in life.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.060]   You know, it's as if there's a neural circuit
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.220]   for sensing thirst and drinking early in life.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.200]   And then later it's used for sensing how to navigate a city.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.460]   Okay, now those are two very disparate things,
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.500]   but this is like outrageous, right?
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.420]   And so I say it's either a feature or a bug, we don't know,
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.060]   but it is the way it is, right?
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.380]   I always say I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.860]   - What do you think was the evolutionary logic of that?
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.560]   - I like to think in a kind of romantic way
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.860]   that some of our most important work in our lifetime
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:23.860]   is to try and resolve these developmental miswirings
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.220]   that are the consequence
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:30.060]   of faulty caretaker-infant relationship.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.900]   And you can't blame the infant.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.340]   Now, does that mean we blame our parents
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.740]   to the point of ostracizing them?
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.780]   Well, one would hope not.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.320]   Maybe in some cases that's necessary.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.260]   But I think, I like to think that what we've observed
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.820]   over the last 10, 20, 30 years, in no small part,
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.940]   seriously, thanks to your work,
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.900]   reflects an evolution
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.620]   of how we are thinking about attachment,
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.260]   that we are actually getting better
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.860]   at understanding the self.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.800]   And there's something about the human brain
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.660]   that wants to understand itself.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.500]   - Very interesting.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.760]   - So I like to think that in a hundred years,
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.740]   not only will there be more models of relationship
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.980]   as functional, healthy relationships,
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.000]   but there will also be a deeper understanding
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.340]   of what this whole thing of love and attachment really is.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.540]   And the parallel I use is one of biology.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.420]   We understand so much more about brain function now
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.120]   than we did just 10 years ago.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.500]   Addiction, for instance,
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.460]   not just a condition of failure of willpower,
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.860]   but this understanding about dopamine and other molecules.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.540]   I think we now look at a fentanyl addict
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.460]   or a heroin addict very differently.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.660]   They're caught in a neurochemical algorithm
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.540]   that is not serving them well.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.740]   It doesn't remove their responsibility,
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:47.540]   but there comes a point where they can't recover themselves
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.620]   and they need certain supports.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.200]   And those supports are starting to emerge now.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   So my hope is that this is built into our evolution
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:01.060]   as some sort of vector toward progress.
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:05.700]   - You know, it's interesting because some models
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.200]   of couples work, of couples therapy will say,
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.620]   you have recreated with each other
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.900]   patterns of your early life
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.940]   in order to be able to transcend them.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.440]   - Right, the repetition compulsion.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.740]   You get the same thing over and over again.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:30.540]   Lord knows I've had that and some wonderful partners.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.000]   And by the way, as I say that,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.020]   I'm also taking 50% of the responsibility.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.880]   So it's, or a hundred percent of the responsibility
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.060]   for the choice.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.860]   As they say, you didn't have six hard relationships.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:43.940]   You had one hard relationship six times, right?
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.020]   And I think Paul Conti says it that way.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:49.860]   But that, yes, that the repetition compulsion
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:54.520]   is a unconscious attempt to resolve the core conflict
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.860]   that arose during early attachment.
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.580]   Do you subscribe to that view?
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.980]   - I think it's a very useful idea.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.940]   You know, I was thinking at one point,
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:07.340]   it's like sometimes when I listen to you
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.780]   and, you know, there is an exactness
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.620]   in the things that you described
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.580]   often rooted in science and research, et cetera.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.620]   Couples therapy or psychotherapy, relationship thinking,
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.700]   you don't have an exact answer.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:29.660]   It's, first of all, you don't have an exact answer
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.460]   because modern relationships are more complex than ever.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.340]   And I don't think any relationship expert
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.880]   at this point can have answers.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.020]   You have invitations, you have ways of thinking
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.980]   that are useful.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.500]   And here is the question.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.500]   Is it true for me is answered by, do the people,
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.380]   does it resonate for them?
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.420]   If they buy it, then it's true.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.620]   It's a framework.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.420]   I can analyze this tableau in multiple ways.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.100]   If this is the one that resonates for you,
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.900]   this is what we're going to go with.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.040]   And that's what makes it true.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.600]   This is a very interesting thing.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.880]   There's multiple, I mean, to me it's interesting
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.480]   because there's a whole movement
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.200]   within the world of psychotherapy and psychology
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.120]   that wants to actually become much more normatized
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.360]   with protocols and the same thing for everyone.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.760]   I think that much of what, at least relationship therapy,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.640]   which is really the world that I practice in,
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.040]   is existential and it's meaning making.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.900]   And there's a lot of ways to do that.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.900]   So if this interpretation works for you, be my guest.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:44.260]   But that's not because it is more true than another.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.780]   It's the one that was useful for you.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.700]   And that makes you much more humble.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.060]   - I love that answer.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.940]   - It's a little bit like when you raise kids, you know?
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.820]   You think that, I used to think that all these things
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.100]   I had done with my first one, you know,
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.460]   is because I had such good ideas.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.860]   Then I had a second one and none of these things
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.580]   worked with them because it was a different person.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.500]   You know, so I realized that the first one,
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.860]   it worked because there was a fit
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.980]   between my method and the person.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.220]   And this is the important thing in therapy
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.820]   is that it's an issue of that fit
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.580]   is what you're looking for.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.700]   - We hear a lot these days about the
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.420]   different attachment styles or languages of love.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.820]   You know, the love languages, you know,
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.100]   people will say, I, you know, I emphasize, you know,
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:35.020]   gifts feel very rewarding or acts of, what is it?
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.540]   Words of affirmation, you know,
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:40.220]   unstructured time or et cetera, et cetera.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.260]   Or people will, I think nowadays,
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.860]   if they look into it a little bit,
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:46.900]   they'll realize that they are either, you know,
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.500]   more avoidant or more anxious.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.420]   These things can shift.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.180]   I mean, I think it's wonderful that people
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.820]   are thinking about these things in the same way
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.500]   that I think it's wonderful that people understand
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.580]   that there's a molecule called dopamine.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.940]   They can do certain things, serotonin, certain things.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.580]   But I'm curious as to whether or not you feel
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.100]   that the naming of things and the assignment of oneself
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.920]   to a category can sometimes be limiting
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:13.340]   in terms of one's ability to really embrace this curiosity.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:16.180]   And you also use the word invitation
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:18.780]   and you are describing couples therapy
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.740]   and healthy relationship as a bit more of an art form
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.620]   than a reductionist protocol oriented science,
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:28.140]   which I love because to me, you know,
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.700]   despite being a scientist,
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.980]   some of the great mystery of life
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.580]   and certainly of romantic relationship
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.820]   is when you find yourself in happy places
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.500]   that you didn't anticipate finding yourself
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:42.120]   or in a place of forgiveness and close friendship,
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.540]   when at one point you can recall being,
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.960]   like you said, like you just,
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.600]   this person is like embodies the worst things in your mind.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.600]   So I think, I wonder if the processes
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.240]   that you found useful in your clinical work,
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.520]   is it possible to formalize those in a way
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.520]   that people can start to adopt to them?
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.160]   In other words, do you think that we can learn
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.840]   to navigate relationship in more healthy ways,
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.400]   not just by saying I'm anxiously attached
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.840]   or avoidant or securely attached,
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.020]   I'm looking for someone that has that,
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.500]   or my love language is this and they love to do that.
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.600]   And so therefore we're a perfect lock and key.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.120]   I think people are starting to think about relationship
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.920]   in a more nuanced and sophisticated way.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.400]   And yet also what I'm hearing is,
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.960]   it's a lot more dynamic than that.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.840]   And that some of those categorizations
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.340]   that we assign ourselves can really perhaps be limiting
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.640]   to what could be.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640]   - It's a great question.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.360]   But I have a moment now as if I'm in the session with you
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.960]   where I have like five things that are arriving here
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.680]   in front of my brain and I'm thinking,
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.480]   which one am I going to enter?
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:58.680]   I'm going to actually start with just the actual question,
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.280]   but then I probably is an opportunity to say a little bit
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.560]   about how I approach this thing.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.280]   I think some naming is very useful.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.480]   It frames it.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.480]   It gives it a foundation, something to hold on to.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.880]   Language matters.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.880]   If we would not be having a conversation
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.740]   without having a shared language at this moment.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.000]   But within that, you and I are using the same words
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.740]   and may have very different meanings attached to it.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:33.040]   So that's the richness of the process is what do you mean
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.040]   when you say invitation, curiosity, conflict, et cetera.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.400]   For example, when I do the work on conflict,
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.880]   I did provide language.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.000]   For example, one of the things that happens in conflict
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.760]   is we have confirmation bias.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.080]   That's a cognitive framework that is often present
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.880]   in situations of emotional conflict.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:59.320]   Of conflict, which involves always an emotional dimension
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.360]   could be political too.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.480]   Confirmation bias means that I am looking for evidence
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.200]   that reinforces my beliefs
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.440]   and I disregard any evidence that contradicts it.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.000]   Now this happens between two people.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.200]   This happens between two parties.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.720]   This is a, that's a very important naming.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.560]   It's interesting.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.200]   I've noticed this, this, this, this,
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.040]   but all you mentioned is that.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.680]   Okay, cognitive bias.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.520]   Another cognitive bias that is very common
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.320]   is fundamental attribution error.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.600]   We have this idea that I am complex and you are more simple.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.240]   If I'm in a bad mood, it's because there was traffic.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.280]   There's circumstances, there's context.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.280]   If you're in a bad mood,
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.440]   it's because you're a cantankerous person.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.160]   That's just your personality.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.640]   You know, we'll categorize and totalize
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.680]   the behavior of others
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.840]   and we'll have lots of nuance and poetry for our own.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.440]   That's a concept.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.400]   That concept is very useful.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   It's neutral.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.800]   It doesn't blame anybody.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.880]   And it says, we all do this.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.800]   I like that kind of naming.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.600]   It's very different from the kind of naming
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.560]   that pathologizes people.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.560]   The kind of naming that unlocks you into one identity.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.520]   You may have addiction.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.880]   And addiction may be really important.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.840]   It may have destroyed your life,
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.960]   but to just say you're an addict.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.760]   So I worked in an addiction center for two years
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.320]   and there were a lot of other things happening
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.480]   in these people's lives.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.000]   And to just focus on this one thing,
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.760]   it reduces the person,
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.360]   but it also reduces your ability
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.680]   to do something with the person.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.360]   It narrows your lens.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.320]   So there's always this question about how wide is the lens
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:46.240]   that you not get overwhelmed.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.680]   So you want to make it smaller, but not that small,
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.480]   that you're looking through a keyhole.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.680]   A person is more complex than a keyhole.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.040]   We don't just treat symptoms.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.800]   We work with lives.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:02.240]   That's the difference, for me anyway,
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.840]   in the work that we do.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.720]   And then when you begin to think about lives,
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.000]   then you start to think about culture.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.200]   What is happening in the world of relationships today?
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.240]   It's such an incredible thing that is going on.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.640]   And if you don't put that in the broader context,
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.560]   I'm trained as a systemically oriented family therapist.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.520]   And that means that you're looking at the interaction
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.600]   of different systems.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.720]   And I think that a lot of what happens
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.760]   is a hyper-individualization of these things.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.040]   And the naming is useful
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.440]   when it expands your understanding.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.400]   The naming is not useful when it locks you into a symptom,
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.400]   a reductionistic thing that gives false certainty to profits.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:52.720]   - I can't agree more. - Now you've got a piece
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.680]   of my mind. - That naming
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.640]   that expands one's understanding
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.400]   and maybe even lends itself to a hint of curiosity
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:05.400]   stands a chance of having some rehabilitative quality to it.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.760]   I feel that nowadays there's such an overuse
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.760]   of psychological terms, like narcissist, gaslighting,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.040]   therapy terms.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.320]   It's almost the way that if people were to talk
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   about neurobiology as neurosurgeons, right?
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.920]   I'm not a neurosurgeon, but I have friends who are.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.320]   And neurosurgery is something people train
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.880]   for many, many, many years for,
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.160]   just as being a clinical psychologist,
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.960]   people train for many years for.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.400]   And have a ton of in-office experience,
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.080]   real world experience.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.440]   Nowadays, the naming and the attachment of names
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.480]   to particular top contour features of people out there
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.640]   seems to be largely for the purpose
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   of closing off possibility
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.840]   as opposed to increasing possibility.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.760]   However- - It's both.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.480]   Because on the one hand,
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.000]   more than many other forms of medicine
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.360]   or healthcare or care, psychotherapy, psychology,
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.600]   but certainly psychotherapy was always stigmatized
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.520]   and still is in many parts of the world.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.800]   It's for the crazies.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.720]   It's for people.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.560]   There must be something fundamentally wrong.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.800]   I mean, it's something that nobody went around talking
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.280]   about the fact that they are in therapy.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.400]   You went to see a therapist, you know,
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.640]   now you're putting it on your dating app.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.400]   You know, it's a status symbol.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.880]   So there is a de-stigmatizing that is very important,
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.760]   but there is also words that are weaponized
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:36.760]   and they are not useful and they are separating people.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.280]   And we have enough separation at this moment
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.600]   in our societies in the West.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:46.080]   We don't need more efforts to pull people apart.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.840]   We need efforts to bring back the collective,
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.840]   the community, the shared experience,
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.080]   because we are too far apart.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.440]   And that's why I think that some naming is useful
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:04.640]   and some naming is not always that useful.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.720]   - Well, amen to bringing people together more.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:12.400]   Yeah, such an important mission right now.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:17.600]   I'd like to explore the possibility
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.760]   of something that I've heard, but I don't know if it's true,
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:27.120]   that sex, which of course doesn't just include intercourse,
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.940]   but the things that lead into
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.920]   and out of sexual intercourse,
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.920]   but that sex is a microcosm for the relationship at large,
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.400]   meaning that the dynamics that show up
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.600]   in intimate interactions are somehow reflective
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.600]   of a larger working out or dynamic in the relationship.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.960]   To what extent do you think that's true?
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.560]   It's a concept that I've heard.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.780]   It sounds interesting, and any discussion about sex
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.580]   tends to get people's ears pricked up,
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.340]   because depending on where you live in the world,
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.900]   it's either something that people talk about
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:12.860]   casually, openly, or with a lot of electricity around it.
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:15.300]   But I always like to say, as a biologist,
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.660]   we can all agree on one thing,
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.680]   which is that we're all here because sperm met egg,
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.540]   if not in human, in dish, and then eventually in human.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:25.420]   So we're still at that point in human evolution.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:30.420]   So what are your views about intimacy and sex
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:34.580]   as a reflection of the relationship?
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:37.420]   And here, what I'm thinking of again are these,
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.100]   when you described conflict,
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:43.180]   you described these three different positioning of arrows,
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.640]   towards one another, away from one another,
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.780]   one chasing the other.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:51.220]   Is there a parallel for healthy relationship
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.780]   that we can offer up?
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:53.620]   - Sexually?
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.620]   - Before talking about this question of whether or not
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:00.980]   sex is a microcosm of the larger relationship,
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.700]   the health of the relationship.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.860]   - Let me start like this.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:07.260]   I mean, I've studied sexuality
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.100]   for quite a few decades now in relationships,
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:14.140]   but I think maybe because of what you said around the world,
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:19.740]   love and desire are universal experiences,
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:22.060]   but the way that they are constructed
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.300]   are highly culturally contextual.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:30.220]   And so the most archaic rooted traditional aspects
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:34.180]   of a culture or a society are lodged around its beliefs
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.940]   and attitudes and behaviors
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.100]   towards sexuality and relationships,
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.000]   especially the sexuality of women,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.020]   American elections case in point.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:46.400]   But the most radical progressive changes
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.380]   that take place in a society
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:52.540]   also occur around sexuality and relationships,
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.820]   sexuality of women in particular.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:58.940]   So sexuality is a window into a society.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:02.340]   Sexuality is also a window into a relationship
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.840]   and into a person that invites deep listening.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:12.860]   One of the big challenges is that modern sexuality
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:16.240]   has been, I mean, traditional sexuality
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.700]   was identified with procreation.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.440]   Modern sexuality is identified with performance and outcome.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.920]   Sex is something you do, to which I say,
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.460]   let's drop the performance and outcome for a moment
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.900]   and let's think of it as an experience.
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:37.660]   So now you're gonna start to see the choreography I draw.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.700]   When I think of sexuality as an experience
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.380]   and I say sex isn't just something that you do,
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:45.260]   sex is a place you go.
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:49.100]   So my question to you is, where do you go in sex?
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:53.580]   Inside yourself and with another or others?
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:57.780]   Do you go to seek deep spiritual union,
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.660]   a deep intimate connection, transcendence?
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:03.780]   Do you go to a place for vulnerability,
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.180]   a place to surrender, a place to be taken care of,
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:11.060]   a place to be safely powerful, a place to be naughty,
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.980]   a place to have just plain fun,
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.620]   a place to abdicate your responsibilities
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.900]   of good citizenship because sexual desire
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.940]   is quite politically incorrect.
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:22.180]   Where do you go in sex?
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.020]   What parts of yourself do you try to connect with?
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.140]   What is it that you're expressing there?
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:30.580]   Sexuality is a coded language
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.420]   for our deepest emotional needs.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:39.500]   Our wounds, our fears, our aspirations, our longings.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.740]   It's that.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:44.040]   That is, you know, sex is never just sex,
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.100]   even when it's hit and run.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.220]   And then it becomes really interesting.
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:52.620]   So one of the things that, one of the assumptions
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.820]   that existed very much at the heart of my field
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.460]   and that I challenged or questioned
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.760]   was that sexual problems are by definition
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.540]   the consequence of relationship problems.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.980]   So you fix the relationship and the sex will follow.
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:11.820]   And I, together with many colleagues,
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:15.500]   have helped a lot of relationships get along better,
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:18.460]   fight less, laugh more, enjoy each other,
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.460]   and it changed nothing in the bedroom.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:24.740]   Because, in fact, maybe sexuality
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.220]   is not a metaphor of the relationship.
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:31.320]   Maybe sexuality is a parallel narrative to the relationship.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:35.380]   And that, in fact, when you change the sexuality
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:38.620]   in a couple, you change the whole relationship.
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:42.380]   But not necessarily in the other direction.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:45.940]   So that opened up a whole,
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.100]   that was one of the foundational ideas
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.020]   for "Mating in Captivity," my first book,
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.660]   because I have been trained to think like this.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:55.740]   And then I began to think love and desire,
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.460]   they relate, but they also conflict.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.060]   They're not one and the same,
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.460]   and they don't need the same things.
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:04.900]   They don't thrive on the same elements.
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:08.740]   And modern relationships, romantic relationships,
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:12.980]   have wanted to reconcile those two fundamental sets
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.700]   of human needs into one relationship.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:20.500]   That is the grand experiment of modern love.
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.700]   - And am I correct in interpreting what you just said
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:27.700]   as that love and desire are fundamentally separate,
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.540]   that they can exist in parallel,
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:33.620]   but that any goal of society, much less a couple,
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:38.620]   to try and unify those as one thing is not going to succeed?
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.460]   - No, no, no, not at all.
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.020]   It actually has been remarkably successful.
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:45.620]   The romantic ideal is tenacious.
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:48.020]   You know, many other philosophies and ideologies
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.940]   of the end of the 19th century have all gone.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.340]   This one has survived many others.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.580]   - I'm relieved to hear you say that.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.420]   - The romantic-
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.300]   - Maybe I grew up on too many,
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.060]   I don't know how many romantic comedies I saw,
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:03.900]   but I grew up in a home where love, sex,
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:08.540]   and romance were discussed in very, almost ethereal terms.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:09.380]   - Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.460]   I think that it's a, but it is an experiment.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.780]   It's not something that we have tried throughout history,
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.140]   in human history.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:21.620]   So I think that if you ask,
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.020]   it's an exercise I like to do sometimes.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:28.700]   I say, divide your page with a line in the middle,
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.300]   up from top to bottom.
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.140]   And on the top left, you write,
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:35.020]   when I think of love, I think of.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:37.260]   Then go to the other side,
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:40.820]   and when I think of sexuality, I think of.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.500]   And then you go back and you say,
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.820]   and when I am loved, I feel.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.740]   And when I am desired, I feel.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:50.540]   When I'm wanted.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.940]   And when I love, I feel.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.420]   And when I want or I desire, I feel.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.260]   And when I think about the love between me and my partner,
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.940]   if there is a couple,
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:03.060]   and when I think about the sexuality
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.260]   between me and my partner,
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.180]   and then you let people free associate about this.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:11.700]   And there are words that you find back and forth,
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.740]   and then there are words who just never appear
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:15.060]   in the other column.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:18.020]   - Do you recommend that couples exchange these documents?
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.180]   - Yeah, they do it at the same time.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:21.100]   Then they read it out loud in front of each other.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.220]   I do this in groups, you know, huge audiences as well.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.860]   But what I'm asking people to see is
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:30.260]   when you look at what you responded in both categories,
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:34.660]   create a line between those two.
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:37.100]   Is it a thick line?
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.460]   Like what happens in love is completely separate for me
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.820]   than what happens in desire.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:44.580]   I need a complete different set of things.
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.020]   I express myself differently.
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.460]   I interact differently.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:50.780]   Or is it very much that when this exists,
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.700]   it completely ignites that.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.140]   They are interrelated, interdependent.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:58.260]   One feeds on each other, one reinforces the other.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:00.620]   There is a degree of variety about that.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:04.500]   For some people, love and desire are inseparable.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.500]   And for some people,
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.420]   they are often irretrievably disconnected.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.340]   And I think the model wants them to be really together.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:17.620]   And for a lot of people, it's exactly what they aspire to.
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:20.220]   For other people, it's more challenging.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.740]   - Because somehow in them there's a split
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:23.580]   between these two things.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.140]   - Because some people
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:31.480]   experience love in such a way
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.960]   that it sometimes becomes challenging for them
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.340]   to make love to the person they love.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:40.260]   What I mean by that is that
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:44.660]   love comes with a sense of responsibility,
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:49.660]   worry, care about the wellbeing of the other person.
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:53.320]   And some of us sometimes have learned to love
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.660]   in a way that comes with extra worry,
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.260]   extra responsibility, extra burden.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.700]   We were the parents of our parents.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:05.160]   We took care of our depressed parent.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.500]   We took care of our alcoholic parent.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.740]   We learn to love with a sense that is not free,
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.100]   that is not curious or playful,
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.620]   because curiosity cannot happen in a state of stress,
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.920]   as you so well said.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.540]   When we experience love with that extra sense of burden,
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:28.380]   it is difficult to be with someone that you feel close to,
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.840]   and at the same time, go inside yourself
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.780]   and completely chill and relax in pleasure land.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:37.060]   That's one of the scenarios, there's many others,
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:39.220]   but this is one of the more common ones,
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:41.020]   Michael Bader's work,
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:44.860]   that makes it difficult for some people
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:48.700]   to experience love and desire at the same time.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.220]   The more they love,
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:52.940]   the more challenging the desire becomes for them,
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.180]   because desire is to own the wanting.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:59.140]   It exists in, you can't make someone want.
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:00.460]   You can make someone have sex,
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.920]   but you can never make them want.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:05.300]   Want is your sovereignty, your autonomy, your freedom.
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:09.340]   And for some people, that wanting cannot exist
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.500]   when they are with someone that they feel so responsible
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.980]   and worried and anxious about.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:18.660]   And that's the attachment piece that you're talking about.
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:24.080]   So this is how the attachment style often manifests
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.980]   in the way that you then organize your sexual self.
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:32.260]   - What percentage of infidelity
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:36.140]   do you think reflects somebody's inability
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:41.140]   to integrate this love component from desire component,
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:47.580]   such that they find that they only experience desire
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:54.820]   or strong desire outside their committed relationship?
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:59.620]   - Look, I wrote an entire book about infidelity,
[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:03.660]   as in what happens when desire goes looking elsewhere.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:07.820]   I think that some people go outside
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:13.380]   as a response to a lot of discontents in the relationship,
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:16.180]   loneliness being the first one,
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:21.180]   neglect, indifference, conflict, rejection,
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:27.180]   sexual rejection in particular.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:29.620]   But some people go outside
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:34.060]   and it has very little to do with the relationship.
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:38.060]   It sometimes has to do with how they organize themselves
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:41.060]   in the relationship to the degree
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:43.580]   that in order to feel a certain freedom
[01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:46.000]   or ability to think about themselves,
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.100]   they need to be outside.
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.500]   And I used to say,
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.820]   I have seen a lot of infidelity in happy relationships.
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.900]   It's not always a symptom of a flawed relationship
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.660]   by no means.
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:03.020]   And that in those situations, people tell me,
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:06.120]   it's not that I wanted to find another person,
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.740]   it's that I wanted to find another self
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:12.220]   or to reconnect with lost parts of myself.
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:15.600]   And I don't say this to promote or to condone or anything,
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.580]   but I just listened across the globe.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:22.960]   One word, it's not that I wanted to find another partner,
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.660]   it's that I wanted to find something else inside of me.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:28.300]   And I don't know how to do that
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.100]   in the relationship that I'm in.
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:33.020]   And that's not because of the person I'm with,
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.540]   that's because of what I do to myself
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:38.780]   in the context of intimate connection.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.060]   And the word that you hear all over the globe
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.460]   when you interview people who are in affairs
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:48.820]   is that they feel alive.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:53.740]   It's kind of the erotic as an antidote to deadness.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.560]   They feel that aliveness.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.560]   And that doesn't necessarily involve sex.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:05.500]   It's about something, aliveness is the erotic,
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:06.900]   not the sexual.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:10.340]   And the erotic is the quality of aliveness,
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:13.380]   vibrancy, vitality, hopefulness,
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:16.140]   curiosity, imagination, playfulness.
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:20.460]   It's those elements that often people lose
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:23.820]   for a host of reasons.
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:28.820]   Life, work, children, dying parents, illness,
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:33.740]   economic hardship, you name it, you know.
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:37.580]   And there's a sense that they need to go elsewhere
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.980]   to find that.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:43.980]   And some people would say bullshit justification
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:48.580]   and some people understand that at the heart of affairs,
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:51.660]   there is betrayal and long and duplicity
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.460]   and lying and all of that.
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:55.660]   But there is also longing and loss
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.920]   on an existential level.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.540]   That's a very different lens into this.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:07.280]   So the people for whom that reconciliation
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.380]   that you talk about is more challenging
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:15.020]   are often people who are often more likely
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.360]   to compartmentalize.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.740]   - What you just said brings me back to this idea
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:21.660]   that we were exploring at the very beginning
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:22.540]   of this conversation,
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:25.460]   that it seems that so much of navigating relationship
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.560]   in healthy versus unhealthy ways
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.060]   depends on this internal dynamic within ourselves
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:35.580]   of an ability to be in close intimate relationship
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:36.420]   with another.
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:41.860]   And yet hold on to enough of our own identity
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.480]   and evolve that identity
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.140]   within the relationship to the other.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.300]   - That is the definition of intimacy
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.760]   or a definition of intimacy.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.380]   And that is probably the number one task
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:57.020]   of every relationship, romantic relationships
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:02.020]   is how do I get close to you without losing me?
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:06.760]   And how do I hold on to me without losing you?
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.800]   Now, you know, I said to you in the beginning
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.320]   that we grow up and we have both needs,
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.160]   togetherness and separateness.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.280]   And then we come out of our childhoods
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:20.460]   and some of us need more space, freedom, separateness.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.300]   And some of us need more protection,
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:24.240]   connection, togetherness.
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.180]   Of course, we tend to meet somebody
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:29.480]   whose proclivities match our vulnerabilities.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.740]   And so you find that in many relationships,
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:36.740]   you have one person who is more afraid of losing the other
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:39.820]   and one person who is more afraid of losing themselves.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:43.820]   One person more afraid with the fear of abandonment
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.720]   and one person more afraid with the fear of suffocation.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:49.740]   - This is a recurring dynamic that you see.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:54.520]   And does it swap back and forth across couples,
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.200]   male, female, I'm assuming in that example,
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.560]   heterosexual relationship,
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.080]   but even homosexual relationships,
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.040]   you'll see it switch back and forth
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.560]   or it tends to be a pretty stable feature.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.560]   Meaning one person in the couple
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.980]   tends to be afraid of abandonment by the other,
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:13.740]   the other person more deeply afraid
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.440]   of abandonment of themselves.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.920]   - Right, it doesn't switch back and forth.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.060]   It switches by relationship,
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.620]   but not within one relationship.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:25.260]   You may have been in different roles
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:26.300]   with different partners.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.140]   - Indeed I have.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:31.220]   So interesting.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.260]   Again, not because you weren't clear,
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:35.780]   you were incredibly clear and concise about this,
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.080]   but I think this is such an important concept.
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.820]   Maybe you'd repeat it for us again,
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.580]   just so that people can really drive
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.080]   into their consciousness
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.120]   and maybe ask themselves the question,
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.700]   are they more afraid of abandonment by the other
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.220]   or abandonment of themselves?
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:53.860]   - You know, one of the ways
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.240]   that you sometimes can see this is that,
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.700]   I mean, in the tour this week,
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:02.340]   one woman stood up and basically said,
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:03.780]   I recently divorced.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.540]   I would like to be able to enter another relationship again.
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.060]   And I said, is the issue an issue of trust
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:11.060]   or is the issue, was there betrayal?
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:12.340]   Was it what's led?
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:16.780]   She says, how do I allow somebody to enter into my life
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:18.580]   without losing myself?
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:23.520]   So it's in the language, it's one person,
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.460]   but this could, and really, I think it's very important
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:30.620]   for me, many of these things are not gender specific,
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.500]   nor orientation particular, this is human.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.980]   But then I answered a little bit
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.700]   with some of this and other things.
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:41.180]   And so then the next question is,
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:43.780]   how often do you not say what you really think?
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:50.220]   Because you want to please or you want to harmonize
[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:53.140]   or you want to avoid conflict.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:55.540]   How often did you then resent the partner
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.400]   who actually stood for their ground?
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:58.940]   Because if you're afraid to lose yourself,
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.860]   you're often more the one who stands for your ground.
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:03.260]   You don't give in because you,
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:05.300]   and if it's rigid, you don't give in at all
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.140]   because you think that every time,
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:10.220]   even the language, agreeing is giving in
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:13.260]   and giving in is losing a part of myself.
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.980]   I mean, it's built in.
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:19.300]   It's so, you know, it starts here
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:20.660]   and it continues all the way.
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:23.780]   It's like, so, do you know what I mean?
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:26.340]   And it's like, it's a sequence of things.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:30.220]   You break apart in small granular pieces.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:34.500]   How does it play out for you when you lose yourself?
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.820]   What are the things you do not do
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:41.660]   that facilitate this dissolution?
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:44.500]   And to the other person who is,
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:48.380]   when you're afraid, sorry, of losing the other,
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:51.140]   and when you're afraid of losing yourself,
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.460]   like where's your rigidity?
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.340]   Where is your kind of totalistic thinking?
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:40:00.100]   Where is this lack of flexibility?
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:04.560]   And that may manifest in, I don't travel to those places.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.900]   You know, the sentence that indicates
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.380]   that we're dealing with this bigger issue
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.220]   is something sometimes very anodyne.
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:15.500]   You know, I don't go to those kinds of restaurants.
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.860]   You know, why shall I go to those kinds of places?
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:18.740]   And you kind of want to say,
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:22.180]   why is there such intensity about the restaurant?
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:23.460]   What are you fighting against?
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.580]   And what are you fighting for?
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:25.940]   And why are you even fighting?
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:27.420]   We're talking about going out,
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:30.060]   supposedly meant to be fun.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.300]   Now you start rewinding.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:36.260]   You know, what is this statement connected to
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.260]   that we are going to have, you know,
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:42.260]   so now you have conflict meeting, identity meeting,
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.420]   connection to another person.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:48.340]   This is when, and it is sleuth work.
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:51.900]   It's fantastically engaging and exciting.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.960]   It's like, I'm sure when you do scientific research,
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:57.100]   it's that sleuth work that you say,
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.380]   this thing doesn't fit at all.
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:02.380]   You know, why do you want me to wear blue shoes?
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:04.620]   Why do you make such a big deal out of the blue shoes?
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.260]   What are blue shoes for you?
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.940]   Don't start talking about the shoes, please.
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:12.140]   Talk about, you know, boundaries,
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.980]   but boundaries today is a concept
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:16.940]   that has become so ill-used almost.
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.940]   So it's talk about how the preservation of the self
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:24.460]   now involves not wearing blue shoes.
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.460]   I mean, you get what I'm-
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:30.780]   - I do, and my mind keeps flitting back
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:32.700]   to this parallel construction of these circuits
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:35.860]   were built in infancy and childhood and adolescence.
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:38.340]   And what kind of flashed to mind
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:40.740]   is when we are adolescents and teenagers,
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.860]   there's this fundamental question that we ask
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:45.500]   that rarely do we ask again later in life.
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:46.900]   I mean, maybe people do,
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.340]   but the question is kind of, who am I?
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:51.300]   You know, teenagers try on a lot
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:52.900]   of different identities often,
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:54.740]   and how they dress, you know,
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:56.900]   is one of the ways in which they self-identify.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:58.660]   Their music, I mean, the music we listen to
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:00.440]   when we're teenagers and young adults,
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.280]   it's forever stamped into us
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.620]   as like some core part of our identity.
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.780]   It has an emotional weight that music
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:08.860]   that we arrive to later doesn't,
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.860]   unless it resonates with that early music
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:13.380]   or recapitulates that rather.
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.540]   So in my mind, I'm thinking,
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:18.460]   I wonder if these circuits that are struggling
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:22.140]   with holding onto self versus a kind of a playful,
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:25.260]   curious exploration of new things, novelty,
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:28.600]   which is so fundamental to relationship.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.820]   And they're not, they're, as we say,
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.500]   as neurobiologists are really antagonistic,
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:34.900]   that they're really in a push-pull.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.660]   I mean, there's so many things that we're discussing today
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:41.460]   that really feel as if these are like circuits
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.680]   that can't be co-active easily,
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.520]   that they're like,
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.980]   that we're in this internal grappling match.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:49.500]   And what keeps coming to mind-
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.300]   - But they also need each other.
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.900]   - Right, they're like the, right,
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:57.620]   it's like the front axle and the back axle of a vehicle.
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:59.460]   Like you can't exist without both.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.900]   - You just made me think of something,
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.900]   because you asked before that,
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.620]   the thing about the sexuality,
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:09.620]   and I like the concept of erotic blueprints,
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:12.620]   which I work with a lot.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:17.380]   And I try to really kind of distill it
[01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:22.220]   in this "Desire Bundle" course that I'm releasing that,
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.060]   'cause I thought,
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:27.360]   how can people ask themselves a set of questions?
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.460]   Like a lot of my work is about finding the good questions
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:34.580]   that will, a good question is like a portal, right?
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:36.660]   And the line on top,
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.940]   which is the answer to your question is,
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.580]   tell me how you were loved,
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:44.020]   and I will tell you how you make love.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:48.900]   Not just how you love, but how you make love.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:50.700]   Meaning that your emotional history
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:53.780]   is inscribed in the physicality of sex.
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:57.140]   And it's all about what you asked me in the beginning,
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:59.700]   identity and change.
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:02.180]   Holding on to oneself, connecting with the other.
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:05.300]   Sexuality is the place where this occurs
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:08.560]   at the most fundamental level.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.820]   It's to be inside oneself
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.980]   and inside the other at the same time.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.860]   Their universe, not their orifices.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.580]   That is what is the experience,
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.500]   that temporary oneness that then again,
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:22.300]   opens up as two people.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:27.080]   So people who struggle with that emotionally,
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.160]   how do I stay connected to me and then to you
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.780]   without these polarities, experience that in sex.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:36.500]   And then you ask a set of questions.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.880]   How did you learn to love and with whom?
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.020]   Were you protected by those people who took care of you
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.980]   or did you have to flee for protection?
[01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:49.380]   Did they take care of you or did you take care of them?
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.780]   Did they hold you, rock you, cuddle you,
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:57.760]   or did they harm you or violate you or shake you?
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.360]   Was it okay to laugh and to cry?
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.280]   Was it okay to experience pleasure?
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.800]   Was it safe?
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.580]   You know, a set of questions like that.
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:11.080]   And this is where people enter their erotic blueprint
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.080]   and get to see that their emotional challenges
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.760]   are directly, if you film them,
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:22.000]   if you watch them making love,
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.020]   you'll understand their emotional challenges,
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.760]   but then comes the next level.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.280]   And if you then study their fantasy lives,
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.200]   then you'll understand the depth of their emotional needs,
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.320]   which are brought into their sexuality.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.520]   - Fascinating.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.340]   - You get it?
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.120]   - I get it, I get it.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.160]   And it makes me think that this earlier discussion
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.000]   we were having, you know,
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.960]   is sex a microcosm for the larger relationship?
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.520]   It sounds to me like the answer is yes,
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:57.520]   but especially the relationship to self,
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.800]   and especially like there's a lot of information
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.360]   in one's desire template or blueprint
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:08.720]   about how one was cared for or not cared for.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:10.840]   - Your sexual preferences,
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:15.840]   your sexual fantasies are a translation
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:18.260]   of your deepest emotional needs.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.980]   Not sexual needs, emotional needs.
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.960]   You know, my mother used to say,
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:26.800]   "Tell me about your friends and I'll tell you who you are."
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:29.160]   And then I said, "You tell me about you sexually,
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:31.760]   and I will know a heck of a lot about who you are."
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.880]   But you have to translate, don't,
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.500]   the problem of sexuality in modern society
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:40.160]   is the literalness with which we approach it.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.200]   And in our pornographic society ever more so,
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.580]   to our detriment.
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.260]   - Right, I couldn't agree more.
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:49.080]   And I think that there also seems to be this attempt
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.000]   to directly translate from,
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.280]   well, if somebody had issues with their mother,
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:56.220]   then they're going to have issues with women as an adult.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.520]   Or if they had issues with their father,
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.760]   they're going to have issues with men as an adult.
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.920]   - That's confirmation based.
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.680]   - Right, but in reality, it's the algorithm.
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:05.640]   It's the algorithm.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.120]   It's that these algorithms that are laid down
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.860]   in our neural circuitry earlier,
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.680]   they don't care about male femaleness.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:14.520]   I mean, it doesn't change
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.580]   whether or not people are heterosexual or homosexual.
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:18.840]   It ain't to them, I believe.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.680]   I think these are frankly biologically driven.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.720]   But the idea is that our ways of being
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.500]   don't translate directly that way,
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:28.960]   that these are deeper processes.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.580]   So if one had issues, for instance,
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:33.040]   with who's male and heterosexual,
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.440]   but they had issues with their father,
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:38.040]   they could have the same issues with women as an adult,
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.360]   right, that it could translate,
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.960]   that it's not always mapping male to male,
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.000]   female to female.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.360]   - I have a segment of my podcast
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.900]   Where Should We Begin that opens the tour
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:54.580]   where basically they talk about how they met,
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:58.600]   and then they fight about everything all the time.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.080]   And they think that they're fighting,
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.460]   this is the line of the show,
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.620]   they think they're fighting about the closet,
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.640]   the cat litter, and the cat.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.720]   What I think they're fighting about
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:11.640]   is that when she says, "Why didn't you close the closet?"
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:13.960]   he instantly thinks of his dad,
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:17.680]   who was this military guy who told him,
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:20.860]   and he's basically in a fight saying to her,
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:24.240]   "You ain't telling me what to do, you ain't the boss of me."
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.440]   So she can never make a request
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.640]   for which he doesn't feel like she's controlling him.
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.560]   And he answers with this fight,
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.200]   and that throws her into the,
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.520]   she grew up all alone, took care of her two siblings,
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.480]   mother was gone, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.440]   And she hoped her whole life
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.920]   she would finally meet a partner
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.400]   and she wouldn't feel alone,
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.600]   and there would be somebody to support her.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.880]   And every time he says to her,
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.060]   "You ain't the boss of me, don't tell me what to do,"
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:51.480]   she says, "Oh, I'm going to be alone
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.760]   for the rest of my life.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.800]   Here I am in the worst place
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.640]   that I always wanted to avoid."
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:58.480]   This is what they're fighting about.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:01.240]   But they're talking about,
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.080]   "Why did you leave the cat closet open?"
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.360]   - Beautiful example, beautiful example.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.360]   It cuts across our preconceived notions
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.580]   that if somebody had a good relationship with their mother,
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:13.120]   they will have good relationship with women,
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.640]   if they good relationship with father, with men.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.360]   - It's a little bit more subtle
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.760]   and complicated nuance than that.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:22.060]   I think the frameworks are useful,
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:24.200]   but they are frameworks.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.560]   And they're models that help us to think
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.600]   and make sense of things.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.240]   But it's a little bit like in science,
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.600]   the truth of today is the joke of tomorrow.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:40.820]   - I hadn't heard that, but that one's going up on X.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:46.160]   And repair work is something that is so fundamental
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.120]   to healthy relationships.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.380]   - It connects to what we discussed about apology.
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:55.680]   - What is your recommendation
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:59.180]   for how couples think about repair work?
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:00.860]   Let's assume that they're still together
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:05.100]   and there's some, at least a hint of a hope
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.080]   to recover the relationship.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:09.900]   Should repair work be framed as,
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:14.440]   in a particular way to facilitate it?
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.100]   You know, how does one begin?
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:19.880]   I mean, I can sort of been,
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.100]   we've been doing a lot of threes today.
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:26.100]   So I can imagine mistakes, misunderstandings and betrayals.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.800]   Right, there are mistakes like,
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.360]   I accidentally step on somebody's toes.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.720]   There's a misunderstandings,
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.560]   two people thought the same thing
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:33.460]   and then they're outright betrayals.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:37.220]   And my understanding from your work is that
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.700]   you've seen many couples, indeed helped many couples,
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:42.220]   recover from all three of those categories
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.260]   to the point where they are quite satisfied
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.400]   with their relationship.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.900]   - There's a sequence to this.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.820]   And it's true in intimate relationships.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:50.040]   It's true in friendships.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:52.380]   I'm very interested in friendships these days.
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:56.140]   And in friendship therapy, I do co-founders where,
[01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:58.820]   I mean, there's other diets that I'm very interested in
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:00.940]   beyond the romantic unit.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:03.340]   - But you said something before
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:05.820]   that I thought actually I may come back to.
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:06.660]   When you said, you know,
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.900]   it's about acknowledging that you were wrong.
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:12.740]   Sometimes you may not have been wrong,
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:13.960]   but you were hurtful.
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:18.360]   And rather than get all, you know,
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.180]   I didn't do anything, I didn't do anything.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:21.220]   It doesn't matter.
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:25.180]   What you did, even if you don't think
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:27.420]   it was anything terrible,
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:29.420]   seem to have really upset your partner.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:31.700]   Do you care about that?
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:34.260]   Or do you want to just kind of stand?
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:38.700]   So I think the first piece in repair work,
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:40.540]   and I think by the way that repair
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:42.600]   is not the end of the story.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.580]   The revival is the end of the story.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:46.140]   - Much better word.
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:48.380]   - You know, the erotic recovery,
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:51.420]   erotic in my sense of the, in my definition of the word.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:54.600]   So that's when I say it's not enough to survive.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:58.020]   It's, I'm a child of survivors.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:00.060]   I wanted to see people who,
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:02.660]   how do they continue to live?
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:05.860]   Not just how do they stay alive?
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:08.420]   And I think that's a fundamental difference
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:11.740]   in our lives and in our relationships.
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:13.500]   It's a huge piece of,
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.900]   it's really at the heart of my work and of my life,
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:16.780]   you know?
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:20.880]   So every trauma process,
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:26.880]   you know, of nations or of individuals,
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.560]   demands the acknowledgment of what happened.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:38.120]   And that acknowledgment involves remorse and guilt
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:42.980]   for the hurt and the harm that it caused.
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:47.180]   Even if you don't feel guilty for the act itself,
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:49.080]   and you think the act is justified.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:53.140]   The consequences of the act on the other person
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:56.140]   is where the guilt and the remorse must take place.
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:59.680]   Without that, there is very little option for repair.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.400]   If I don't feel that you even know what you did to me,
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:09.360]   my, you, my dad, you, my boss, you, my political enemy,
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.000]   I mean, that, it's really at the root.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.000]   So after you do the remorse and the guilt,
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.900]   the next part is to be really careful
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:22.840]   that you don't sink into the self,
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:25.760]   now I'm going back to relationships, into the shame.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.040]   I'm such a terrible person.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.680]   How could I do something like this?
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:30.740]   So I feel so bad about myself
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:32.640]   that I still can't feel bad about you.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.800]   Now that's narcissism.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:37.400]   That's a different story.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:39.400]   The point is not for you to still think
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.560]   that you're at the center.
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:42.000]   You were at the center when you hurt,
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.360]   and now you're at the center of your own wound.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:49.760]   It's really a process of reckoning with the other person.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.960]   And it's slow and challenging for some,
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.760]   and it's immediate for others.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:58.840]   And then I think the next piece in a relationship
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:03.840]   is not just to apologize and to show your remorse,
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:07.080]   but it's actually to show that you value the other person
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:08.760]   because hurting a person,
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.440]   and especially when it's betrayal and careless,
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.700]   is a devaluation of the other person.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:14.840]   You didn't matter.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:18.400]   That me mattered more than you.
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.200]   For whatever the reasons, it was still selfish,
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.080]   and I devalued you.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:26.100]   And to become the vigilante of a relationship
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:30.000]   is that you become the person who protects the relationship
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.160]   by showing that the other person really matters.
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:35.360]   And in detail, that sometimes means,
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.640]   you know, how are you today?
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.080]   Is there anything you want to talk about?
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.880]   Do you still think about it?
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:45.720]   You know, this is a big one to carry every day.
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:48.160]   Are you able to go to see this movie?
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:51.400]   Can we, you know, just without being so afraid
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.640]   that every time you ask, you're going to get blamed again,
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.080]   or you're going to feel so bad about yourself.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:01.580]   It's a little bit step out of yourself and just reach out
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:03.420]   and just check in half the time.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:04.840]   When you say, how are you?
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:05.680]   And do you want to talk?
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:07.960]   The person says, no, I don't.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:10.240]   But I just wanted to know that you are prepared to,
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.600]   in case I needed to.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.140]   Set the conditions.
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:17.280]   Make me feel that you value me and our relationship,
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:19.120]   which you have just trashed.
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:22.600]   And then the third thing is what I call the erotic recovery.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.820]   It's the regeneration or the generation of new cells.
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:32.760]   And, you know, I need a new skin to come over the scab.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.340]   That's the real, you know, repair is not yet healing.
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:41.900]   The healing is, I know I hurt myself somewhere.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.040]   It's here.
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:45.040]   I can feel it when I touch it,
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.360]   but I don't feel it the whole time.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:50.480]   It's not front and center every moment
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:53.020]   of my obsessive rumination.
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:57.520]   But when I touch it, it's tender, it's wounded.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:02.200]   It's a place that I need to make sure not to hit again.
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.560]   And don't hurt me again.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:04.800]   And don't do this to me again.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:07.400]   I can't recover from that twice.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:09.560]   It's very, it's that vulnerable.
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.480]   And then it says, let's go do new things.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.600]   You know, erotic recovery is not about comfortable
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.720]   and familiar and the return to the status quo.
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:21.980]   Erotic recovery is about new, risky, curious,
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:26.540]   playful, unknown imagination outside of the comfort zone
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:31.220]   so that we can see ourselves anew as who we are
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.640]   and who we are together.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:36.900]   And I think that's where the revival takes place.
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:40.720]   It's hopeful, it's possibility, it's adventure.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:42.600]   It's got that energy.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.960]   - Beautiful, aspirational, and realistic too.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:51.240]   This notion of, not notion, forgive me.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:55.080]   This act of truly getting outside of oneself
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:57.200]   to be present to the way the other person feels
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.320]   irrespective of who was right or who was wrong,
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:01.060]   if it was a misunderstanding, betrayal,
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.960]   but especially in cases of betrayal.
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:05.780]   The exiting of, as you said,
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:09.200]   either a stance of not wanting to look at it for oneself
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:12.800]   or of self-flagellation, both are self-centered.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.800]   So really getting into genuine care for,
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:21.240]   if not caretaking, or the offer of care
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.260]   for the other person. - I can't believe
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:24.540]   I hurt you that bad.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:27.720]   You know, one of the big things is people are often shocked
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.960]   at the hurt of the, I told you I wouldn't care
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.720]   about what I thought, or I didn't think about it.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:34.680]   I just didn't, because there is a dissociation
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.040]   that takes place when you take off.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.640]   And so, when people are faced with the raw
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:47.720]   hurt, wound, suffering, collapse, fracture
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.240]   of the other person, they find it very hard to tolerate.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:53.400]   And this has to happen.
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:57.680]   You have to be able to know the consequences of your action.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.880]   If you want to, you know,
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:01.700]   freedom in the existentialist, Sartreian terms
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:04.440]   involved the ability to take responsibility
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.040]   for the consequence of your actions.
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:08.300]   This is it.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.420]   I'll help you face that.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:12.760]   That doesn't mean that you become the worst creature
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:15.800]   on the planet, but you are, you have to face that.
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:17.880]   And that is something very hard for us,
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.360]   because sometimes we meant it,
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.160]   sometimes we thought we deserve it,
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:23.640]   and sometimes we didn't think that
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.140]   that was gonna be the case.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:28.960]   And so, it's sometimes easier to stand
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:32.480]   in front of someone else's anger than someone else's hurt.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:34.720]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:36.960]   And what you're describing also perhaps
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.320]   at least partially explains why sometimes, not always,
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.560]   apologies are insufficient, necessary but not sufficient,
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:47.400]   because there are certain modes of apology
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:52.400]   that don't show us that the person who's apologizing
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:54.240]   is really outside themselves.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:56.280]   They're in their own guilt, they're in their own shame,
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.840]   and therefore, they're not really present to how we feel.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.840]   - There's a beautiful book by Harriet Lerner
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:04.480]   about apology that I often recommend in these situations,
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:08.740]   'cause she really analyzes, if you ever do apology,
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:14.440]   this concept of sincerity, of the apology
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.720]   that actually shows that I care about you
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:19.960]   and not just about restoring my dignity
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:21.920]   and my pride and all of that.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.560]   The maneuvers that are about self-preservation
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:27.360]   versus the maneuvers that are really
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:30.360]   about restorative justice.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:34.120]   Who is ready for relationship?
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:37.340]   And for people who are not in relationship or who are,
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:42.480]   what sorts of questions should they be asking themselves?
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:46.580]   What sorts of things should we all be doing?
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:50.880]   - You know, it's a question that I ask people often,
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:53.120]   almost in the first session.
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:56.280]   Knowing yourself as well as you do,
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:59.320]   what do you think makes it hard to live with you?
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.400]   - Great question.
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.480]   My answer's far too long to give here.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.200]   Everyone will be relieved.
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:08.160]   - That will give you some of the material about,
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:13.200]   nobody's ready, as in, I'm prepared, I'm perfect,
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.160]   I'm fully baked.
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:19.040]   I say to every person, everyone has relationship issues
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:20.080]   they're going to have to address
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:21.160]   at some point in their life.
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:26.000]   The only question is with whom, not if, just with whom.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.600]   Who's the one that you're going to do the work with?
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:32.040]   We're all works in progress.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:36.280]   We are notoriously imperfect, rather unpredictable.
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.640]   And many relationship problems are not problems
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.120]   that you solve, they're paradoxes
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.120]   that you have to learn to manage.
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:46.760]   - Well, I want to make clear that before what I say next,
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:51.960]   that if I had my way, we would continue this conversation
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:54.280]   for many hours, if not days.
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.200]   Perhaps there's an opportunity for that in the future,
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:59.400]   but I was told, and not surprisingly,
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.080]   that you're in tremendous demand.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:02.560]   You're on a live tour now.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.120]   I can't wait to see this.
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.000]   It's all sold out, so I'll have to wait like everyone else.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.680]   But it sounds like an incredible experience.
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:13.160]   Indeed, I know some people, and I've spoken directly to them
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:14.960]   who attended one of your lives recently,
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:17.840]   and they sound like a completely immersive
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:21.120]   and experience like no other.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.560]   So I'm very excited about that.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:24.920]   My only regret about your tour
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:28.960]   is that we have to halt this conversation
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.400]   in the next couple of minutes.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.360]   And there are a couple of things
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.160]   I just want to reflect back to you
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:36.840]   that are all from a place of real deep appreciation.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:41.020]   First of all, for bringing forward what you've brought today,
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:45.520]   you're one of these exceedingly rare people
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:50.760]   with whom when they speak, gems just fall out of them.
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:52.720]   And I know I'm not alone in this sentiment.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:55.160]   I mean, just in today's conversation,
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:59.520]   you've transformed the way that I think about relationship,
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:04.520]   self, identity, neurobiology, love, sex, so many key topics.
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:12.360]   And in a much larger way, as you pointed out,
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:14.340]   and I completely agree,
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:16.420]   the themes that you're talking about
[02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:19.080]   are not just fundamental for us to resolve as individuals.
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:21.760]   They are not just fundamental for us to resolve in couples
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:23.380]   or whatever relationship configuration
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:24.920]   people happen to be in.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.980]   - They're societal.
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:30.000]   - They're societal, that we can look at anything,
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.760]   an election, two countries battling one another,
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:36.040]   political groups, whatever.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:39.440]   At every level, this is what it means to be human,
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.960]   built up from the same fundamental circuit,
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.360]   same fundamental dynamics.
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.920]   And I really see you as not just a pioneer,
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:51.520]   but the pioneer of this parting of the veil
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:54.440]   from what has, I think, until this point in human history,
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.440]   been a lot of descriptions of things,
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.960]   of what's right, what's wrong, this and that,
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.900]   and some of that might be true.
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:02.420]   I don't know, I'm not qualified to know,
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:05.360]   but that you represent a real parting of the veil
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:08.280]   into the next evolution of what it means
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.680]   for humans to interact in more healthy ways
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:13.680]   and with curiosity and sense of invitation
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.720]   toward more love, connection, and peace.
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:19.160]   So, there really aren't words to express
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:23.400]   how enthusiastic and appreciative I am
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.220]   of what you brought here today and what you're doing.
[02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:28.680]   And so, I just wanna say deep heartfelt thanks.
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.760]   And I know I speak for many, many people.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.800]   - Thank you so much.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:35.540]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:38.240]   about romantic relationships with Esther Perel.

[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:14.840]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.520]   I do read all the comments.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:17.680]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:18.880]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.480]   It's my very first book.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.880]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:24.040]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:25.200]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.360]   for more than five years,
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.680]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:30.240]   of research and experience.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:33.300]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:35.800]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:38.240]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:41.600]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.680]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:47.600]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.960]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.720]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:53.480]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:56.080]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:58.040]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:01.020]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.600]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:05.480]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:07.040]   And on all those platforms,
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.160]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:10.680]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:12.120]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:14.000]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.200]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:18.280]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:19.440]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:21.200]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:22.640]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:24.640]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:26.200]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:28.360]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:30.140]   one to three page PDFs.
[02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:32.640]   Those protocol PDFs are on things like
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:35.440]   neuroplasticity and learning, optimizing dopamine,
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:38.000]   improving your sleep, deliberate cold exposure,
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.040]   deliberate heat exposure.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.120]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.280]   that describes a template routine
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.800]   that includes cardiovascular training
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:46.760]   and resistance training with sets and reps,
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:48.200]   all backed by science.
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:50.620]   And all of which again is completely zero cost.
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:53.200]   To subscribe, simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:55.820]   go to the menu tab up in the upper right corner,
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:57.920]   scroll down a newsletter and provide your email.
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:05:58.760]   And I should emphasize
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:01.200]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:02.440]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:04.560]   for today's discussion with Esther Perel.
