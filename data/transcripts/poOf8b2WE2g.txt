[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.220]   Today, we are discussing the immune system,
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.600]   and we are also discussing the nervous system,
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.140]   which is the brain, spinal cord,
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.940]   and the connections of the brain and spinal cord
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.720]   with all the organs of the body.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.260]   We are also going to discuss how the nervous system
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.680]   can be used to activate and control the immune system.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.940]   Now, about 10, 20 years ago,
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.020]   somebody said that the mind could control the immune system.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.920]   It'd probably get laughed out of most academic conferences,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500]   and certainly the work wouldn't be published
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.520]   in quality journals.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.020]   But nowadays, there are dozens, if not hundreds,
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.100]   of quality peer-reviewed studies on how the mind
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.580]   and how the nervous system can control activation
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.180]   of the immune system.
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.820]   This is a wonderful growing body of research.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.180]   And just to give you a hint of where we are headed with this,
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.900]   just this last week, there was a paper published in Nature,
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.040]   which is the apex journal for scientific publishing,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.720]   premier journal, extremely stringent.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.500]   A paper published in Nature from Chufu Ma's lab
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.440]   at Harvard Medical School explored how acupuncture
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.580]   can reduce inflammation in the body.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.060]   And I will describe this study in a bit more detail later,
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.660]   but what they discovered was that by stimulating the body
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.420]   in particular ways at particular sites on the body,
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.000]   they were able to liberate certain cells and molecules
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.920]   that enhance the function of the immune system
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.700]   and potentially can be used to combat
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.540]   different types of infection.
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.620]   And just to give you another little hint,
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.260]   they found that a particular type of organ tissue
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.580]   called fascia, some of you may have heard of fascia,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.940]   fascia surrounds our muscles.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.780]   Just to look at it,
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.340]   you might think it's a kind of useless tissue.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.100]   It's sort of like a dense bag
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.000]   in which the muscles are contained.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.100]   Well, it turns out that those dense bags
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.400]   are much smarter than we thought.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.580]   They don't have a mind of their own,
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.860]   but by stimulating the fascia
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.260]   in a particular location on the body,
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.500]   there's a pathway leading out of that fascia
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.400]   directly to an organ called the adrenal medulla,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.600]   I'll explain what all this means,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.300]   that could liberate particular chemicals
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.940]   that had a potent anti-inflammatory effect.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.900]   So what we're basically saying is that the nervous system
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.820]   acts as a set of highways
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.780]   between the different tissues of your body,
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.340]   calling into action the immune system,
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.000]   liberating particular molecules
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.380]   that can reduce inflammation and lead to faster healing.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.400]   And I will explain how all of that works
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.660]   as well as some other non-acupuncture methods
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.700]   for activating and enhancing
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.020]   the function of the immune system.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.220]   So today we're going to be talking
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.100]   all about healing with the mind
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.020]   in a completely non-mystical, non-abstract sense.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.980]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.900]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.160]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.220]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.540]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.040]   to the general public.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.240]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.260]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.580]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.940]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.860]   that are absolute superb quality.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.260]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.680]   And I can tell you that one of the major issues
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.800]   our visual system has to contend with
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.980]   is how to see things clearly in bright environments
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.420]   or dimmer environments, et cetera.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.100]   Roca clearly understands the science of the visual system
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.380]   because one thing that's wonderful about their sunglasses
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.060]   is that you can be in a very bright environment
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.020]   and then walk into a shadowed environment
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.860]   and you don't even notice the transition.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.620]   Everything is still seen with crystal clarity.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.980]   Their eyeglasses as well allow you to see things
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.740]   regardless of how bright or dim internal lighting is.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.780]   I wear readers at night.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.620]   I wear sunglasses during the day.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.300]   And Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are particularly nice
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.960]   because they're very lightweight.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.480]   I often forget that they're even on my face.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.820]   They also don't slip off if you get sweaty.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.580]   They were actually designed to be used
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.220]   while running or cycling.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.900]   And so I can use them while exercising.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.100]   They also have a great aesthetic.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.220]   So you can go from exercising to dinner or to work
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.260]   without having to change from one set of glasses
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.540]   to the next.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.040]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.740]   you can go to roca.com.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.700]   That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman

[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.820]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.620]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.060]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.780]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.660]   And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.660]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.280]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.860]   once or twice per day
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.300]   is because it allows me to cover
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.440]   all of my basic nutritional bases.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.560]   It's got the vitamins and minerals
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.060]   that make sure that no matter what I'm eating,
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.420]   I'm covering all of my micronutrient bases.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.060]   And it has the probiotics.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.800]   And probiotics we now know
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.980]   are essential for a healthy gut microbiome
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.180]   and a healthy gut microbiome we know
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.340]   is essential for many important biological functions
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.620]   related to human health,
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.920]   like metabolic needs, endocrine function,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.800]   immune function, and so on.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.040]   With Athletic Greens, I can mix that up with water.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.160]   I usually add some lemon or lime juice.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.300]   It tastes delicious.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.140]   I like it very much,
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.700]   and I'll drink it once early in the day
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.040]   and once again later in the afternoon.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.400]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.240]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.620]   And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.280]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.380]   which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens,
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.300]   whether you're in the car or on a plane or on the move.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.180]   And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.260]   There is now a lot of data showing that vitamin D3
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.560]   is important for many biological functions
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.840]   that impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.240]   And most people do not get enough vitamin D3,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.820]   even if they're getting a lot of sunshine.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.100]   And K2 is also important,
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.120]   or has been shown to be important for heart health
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.420]   and for blood lipid function, et cetera.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.440]   So again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.540]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.960]   to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.840]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.700]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.520]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.100]   to help you better meet your immediate
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.060]   and long-term health goals.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.980]   I've long been a fan of getting regular blood work done
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.560]   for the simple reason that many of the things
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.880]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.500]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.940]   There's just simply no other body surface marker
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.940]   that you can look at somebody or yourself and say,
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.780]   ah, you know, I know that my blood lipids
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.220]   or my cholesterol are good,
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.540]   or that my hormone levels are X, Y, or Z.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.240]   We really need numbers on those things
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.260]   to know where they sit.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.180]   The problem with a lot of blood tests, however,
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.700]   is you get all those numbers back.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.760]   You don't know what to do with that information.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.340]   Inside Tracker has solved that problem.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.460]   They have a very easy to use dashboard
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.900]   where when you get your numbers back,
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.460]   it can tell you, for instance,
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.220]   where your numbers are high or low or on target,
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.420]   and they can suggest very specific dietary interventions,
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.260]   supplemental interventions, and behavioral interventions
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.020]   that can allow you to bring those numbers
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.380]   to where you would like them to be.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.960]   So they've simplified the whole process.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.500]   And in terms of getting the blood test,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.580]   you can go to a local center to get the blood drawn,
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.300]   or they can even send somebody to your house.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.980]   They've made the whole thing very, very easy
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.440]   from start to finish.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.320]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.420]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.700]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.640]   You just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.380]   Okay, let's talk about the immune system
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.260]   and the nervous system and how the two interact
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.720]   and how you can control your immune system
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.700]   to serve you better.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.380]   We are going to talk a lot of mechanistic science,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.240]   a little bit of detail.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.500]   You learned some new language around the immune system,
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.300]   names of the different cell types and so forth,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.180]   but I promise to make it all very clear
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.900]   regardless of your background.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.420]   We are also going to discuss a lot of tools.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.160]   And I think many of you are probably here
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.060]   because you want to know what you can do
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.460]   in order to boost or enhance the function
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.560]   of your immune system.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.580]   That's a very reasonable question to ask.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.860]   I want to begin by just acknowledging that
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.640]   if one were to put that question into the internet,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.200]   you would get back a lot of answers.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.620]   And there is now a sort of generic form of that answer
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.460]   that deserves our respect,
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.340]   but is not going to be the topic of conversation today.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.620]   I just want to tip my hat to it, however,
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.780]   and list off a few of the things that we know
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.940]   set us up to be healthier than we would be
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.900]   if we didn't do these things.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.020]   So the first of course,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.100]   is the foundation of all mental and physical health,
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.280]   which is to get adequate sleep, meaning enough sleep,
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.500]   whatever it is for you that you require to get deep sleep.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.340]   So it's got to be of high quality
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.620]   and to time that sleep correctly,
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.280]   meaning you can't sleep during the day one day
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.220]   and at night the next day
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.060]   and expect your system to function well.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.840]   Talked a lot about that before on this podcast.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.620]   You need a relatively consistent sleep schedule
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.480]   most of the time, about 80% of the time,
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.360]   or even better would be 90% of the time.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.040]   But the realities of life make it that
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.020]   we can't always go to bed at the same time
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.140]   and wake up at the exact same time.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.540]   So we need sleep.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.700]   We do need sunshine.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.700]   Why do we need sunshine?
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.820]   Because it sets our rhythm into a regular state
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.520]   where the genes in all of our cells
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.260]   can be expressed at the correct times.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.320]   We're sort of a factory of cells, if you will,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.060]   and that factory can only run properly
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.960]   if it knows when certain things should be active
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.100]   and when certain cells should not be active.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.840]   And the best way to coordinate all of those activities
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.680]   of all the cells is to get sunshine in your eyes
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.940]   in the morning and again in the evening
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.180]   and not to get too much bright light in your eyes
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.520]   in the middle of the night.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.860]   That's just foundational.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.860]   And then any lists that you'll find
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.220]   on any number of websites on the internet would say,
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.040]   okay, get good sleep, get sun, get exercise.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.160]   How much exercise?
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.660]   We should all be getting 150 to 180 minutes
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.420]   of zone two cardio.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.440]   That's cardiovascular exercise
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.820]   where we can just barely hold a conversation
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.480]   or maybe not per week.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.660]   We should be eating well.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.220]   We're always told we have to get good nutrition.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.660]   What good nutrition means to you is going to be different
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.940]   than what it means to somebody else.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.460]   But we acknowledge that food intake
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.600]   and quality of food in particular,
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.260]   avoiding processed foods, that's going to be important.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.660]   Social connection is important.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.860]   Hydration is important.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.620]   You're starting to get the picture.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.860]   We can take all that, acknowledge it as useful
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.640]   and foundational for mental and physical health.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.100]   But of course, there are many people who still struggle
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.100]   with getting ill too often or with not being able to heal
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.660]   from physical injuries and wounds or from various bacterial
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.700]   and viral infections quickly enough
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.180]   or deal with chronic disease.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.740]   And so today is really about how you can take all
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.020]   of that information, acknowledge it and follow it.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.220]   But in addition to that, there are things
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.800]   that you can do to leverage your nervous system
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.860]   in order to enhance the function of your immune system
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.760]   in very robust ways.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.380]   So that's where I'd like to shift the conversation to.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.060]   The first topic we have to attack is the question
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.760]   of what is the immune system and how does it work?
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.140]   I think many of you have heard of antibodies
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.500]   or killer cells or the various organs of the body
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.840]   that are involved in the immune system,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.060]   like the bone marrow, the spleen, the thymus
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.220]   and the lymph nodes.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.380]   I'd like to just take a moment
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.380]   and do a sort of brief immune system 101.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.780]   Really simple, cover the basic elements of the immune system
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.120]   so that everyone listening or watching this
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.660]   can get a clear sense of how the immune system functions
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.160]   and what its basic parts are.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.340]   For some of you, this might be too basic.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.940]   It might be a little bit of background
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.960]   that you already know.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.540]   I think for most of you, this information will be new.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.340]   And I promise you, you don't need a biology
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.260]   or medicine background in order to understand this.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.540]   It's actually really simple
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.540]   because it is truly elegant in design.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.540]   You have three main layers of defense for your health.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.580]   These are the three things that are constantly at work
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.540]   to protect you from invasion and illness,
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.240]   from bacteria, from viruses and from parasites.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.140]   And the first of those three is a physical barrier
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.100]   that we call your skin.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.460]   And that might seem kind of obvious,
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.300]   but everything about you is contained in this compartment
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.300]   that is boundaried by your skin.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.100]   And your skin is a very important aspect
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.780]   of your immune system.
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.080]   If you've ever had a cut,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.900]   you essentially have a breach of the boundary
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.860]   that is your immune system.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.960]   And you would notice a number of things would happen.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.220]   You might get some swelling around that cut.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.740]   You might get a scab.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.520]   Likely you would get a scab over time.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.860]   If it got dirty, there were some bacteria that got in there.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.100]   You might see some accumulation of white blood cells,
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.940]   what's called pus.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.220]   I know it's kind of gross, but that's what that is.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.020]   It might take on a yellow tint
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.060]   because of the accumulation of some dead cells there.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.720]   But basically your skin is the primary barrier
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.140]   through which you keep things from the outside
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.900]   that could harm you from getting to the inside.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.600]   Now, still in category one,
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.760]   your body and your external surface,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.300]   you have openings to that surface, right?
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.960]   You're not just a round or a body-shaped,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.460]   completely covered up with skin, you have openings.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.300]   What are those openings?
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.140]   Well, let's start at the top and work our way down.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.100]   A primary site of potential infection are your eyes.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.960]   You have your ears, you have your nostrils,
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.120]   you have your mouth, okay?
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.200]   Those are going to be the primary sites
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.900]   by which things can get into your system.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.260]   And you need to put things into your system.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.300]   You need to drink and eat
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.820]   and you need to get light into your system.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.620]   That's why you have those openings.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.780]   But bad things, meaning things that can harm you,
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.120]   can get into those systems.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.540]   And then of course, along the back of your throat,
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.180]   all the way down to your stomach and your digestive system,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.260]   and through your intestines and out your rectum,
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.400]   you have a tube that you are basically a series of tubes.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.780]   I've said that before in this podcast,
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.460]   and this is one such tube by which you extract nutrients
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.120]   from the outside environment.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.460]   But all along that tube,
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.140]   including your nose and your mouth, it's lined with mucus.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.320]   And while mucus might seem kind of gross to some of you,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.380]   the more you learn about mucus,
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.420]   the more you realize that mucus is really, really cool.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.140]   Because mucus essentially acts as a filter,
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.420]   as a trap for bacteria and viruses.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.240]   And it has certain ways of scrubbing
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.160]   or killing those bacteria and viruses.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.860]   Now, the mucus is constantly being turned over.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.060]   And as we'll talk about later,
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.120]   the chemistry of that mucus is really important
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.060]   in order to make sure that certain things
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.200]   don't make it into your system
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.400]   and other things are allowed to move through your system
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.540]   and you can extract nutrients from them.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.680]   So the reason I'm talking about this first category
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.440]   of a barrier for immune system in such detail
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.140]   is I'd like you to envision yourself as a human, of course,
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.500]   but as a human that is a clear entity from everything else,
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.920]   and you have to bring in the right things
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.400]   and you have to keep out the wrong things or kill them.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   Now, inevitably, bacteria, viruses, and parasitic infections
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.540]   are going to make their way into our body.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.560]   But whether or not they are killed off
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.520]   or whether or not they take over and cause us harm
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.060]   is going to be determined by layers two and three.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.240]   So layers two and three are the so-called
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.620]   innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.120]   So the innate immune system is what I would call
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.480]   the second layer of defense, it's very fast.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.880]   So whether or not it's bacteria, virus, or parasite,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.880]   what happens when you have something enter your body,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.380]   maybe you swallowed it, maybe it got in through your eyes,
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.040]   maybe you shook somebody's hand
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.560]   who is carrying a particular kind of illness
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.200]   and then you wiped your eyes.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.840]   And I've talked about on this podcast before,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   very soon after we meet another person,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.200]   usually within 30 seconds, believe it or not,
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.660]   most people wipe that person's chemicals
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.980]   somewhere on their face or on their body surface.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.740]   This has been demonstrated over and over again.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.800]   If you want to learn more about that,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.780]   we did an episode all about chemical signaling
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.620]   where you can learn about it.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.180]   I know it sounds weird and you might say, I don't do that,
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:41.180]   but indeed you do most of the time, most everybody does.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.220]   Okay, so this innate immune system is this rapid response.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.580]   When something enters our system
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.980]   and our body doesn't recognize it, it's not food,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.860]   it's not clean air,
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:57.160]   it's something that's either a bacteria virus or parasite.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.980]   And the innate immune system involves the release
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.980]   of particular cells that are waiting dormant,
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.620]   ready to attack whatever this invader is.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.480]   And some of these cell types you've heard of before,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.740]   the most typical one are the so-called white blood cells.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.120]   So the white blood cells will actively go
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.700]   to the site of invasion and will start to encapsulate
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.020]   or try and surround that given invader.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.060]   The other names of these different cell types are things
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.900]   like neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells,
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.580]   just a few of the many types of immune cells.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.980]   So there's kind of like an ambulance system,
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.180]   but rather than go and try and heal something
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.420]   like a paramedic would, they go there and they try
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.440]   and surround and kill whatever this invader is.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:47.700]   They work in concert with two other assistants
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.180]   and those assistants are called the complement proteins.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.200]   Complement proteins exist in the blood.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.800]   And what they do is they travel to sites
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.820]   where there's an invasion and they mark certain things
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.180]   for being engulfed and eaten.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.680]   So they sort of put an eat me tag on it.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.220]   They basically put a chemical tag onto invaders
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.340]   that then allows those white blood cells, neutrophils,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.940]   macrophages and natural killer cells to say,
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.580]   ah, I need to basically wrap, you'll kill this thing
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.500]   and then wrap it in a body bag and send it off,
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.520]   kill that thing, wrap it in a body bag and send it off.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.460]   And I'm using the analogy of the body bag,
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.380]   but in a sense it is one, it's the right one rather,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.780]   because these cells that come in and kill things,
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.340]   the way they do that is actually to engulf
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.700]   the invading bacteria virus or parasite.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.060]   So they actually surround it.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.900]   And when you see pus or you see infection
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.420]   maybe a cut on the skin or something like that,
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.720]   or even in an ingrown hair that gets some bacteria in it,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.000]   that pus and that the white part,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.220]   I know it's kind of gross to talk about,
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.980]   but those are the white blood cells.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.360]   And those are the dead, oftentimes it's dead cells,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.420]   and that's the dead invader sitting there.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.660]   So it's trying to create an isolated compartment
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.000]   'cause it wants to keep it in that part of the body.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.960]   So you've got the innate immune system.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.100]   The compliment comes through blood
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.360]   and helps it by tagging certain things
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.860]   with an eat me signal.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.740]   And then there are the cells that are either damaged
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.100]   from the injury or from the parasite
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.820]   or are suffering because of the bacteria
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.360]   or the virus itself.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.140]   And the cells of your body
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.860]   will also release an alarm signal,
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.720]   which is not an eat me signal, but a help me signal.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.040]   And those help me signals come in the form
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.740]   what we call cytokines.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.460]   And the cytokines are things like interleukin-1,
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.620]   interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.900]   You may have heard of these things
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.580]   if you are at all curious about
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.460]   or been learning about the health space,
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.560]   online health space, especially in the last few years.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.940]   Inflammation is all the buzzword now.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.040]   Everyone's talking about inflammation,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.300]   inflammation, inflammation.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.380]   What do we mean when we say inflammation?
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.800]   Well, inflammation is a physical response,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.060]   but it's also a chemical response.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.660]   And many times the markers of inflammation
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.380]   that are measured in people or an animal model,
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.060]   excuse me, where this research is done
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.060]   are things like interleukin-1, interleukin-6,
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.720]   tumor necrosis factor alpha.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.340]   So when those go up in the blood,
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.500]   it's a sign that somewhere there's a cell
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.840]   that's saying, help me, help me,
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.020]   and it's secreting these things,
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.060]   which calls in those neutrophils, macrophages,
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.820]   natural killer cells, and white blood cells, okay?
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.860]   And it might help to remember all this,
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.200]   but by just telling people that what interleukin means
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.540]   is to communicate, right?
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.500]   So the interleukin is shouting out, help me,
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.540]   the complement proteins are coming in and saying,
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.300]   eat this, and tagging the invader with an eat me signal.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.840]   And then the killer cells and the white blood cells
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.300]   are doing the job of trying to kill off that thing.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.140]   That's the innate immune system.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.940]   So your skin and your mucus lining,
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.700]   plus your innate immune system
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.260]   are a beautiful two-layered set of defenses
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.580]   against various kinds of invaders and infections.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.080]   And then there's the third type,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.020]   which is the adaptive immune system.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.300]   And you'll notice that leading up until now,
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.060]   I haven't said the word antibody at all.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.180]   And that's because it is the job,
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.480]   not of the skin or the mucus or the microbiome
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.820]   or the innate immune system to produce antibodies
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.840]   that can recognize specific invaders,
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.140]   but rather it is the job of the adaptive immune system
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.740]   to create antibodies against bacteria, viruses,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.520]   and even parasites and even physical intruders
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.880]   to your system.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.320]   So the adaptive immune system has this incredible ability
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.960]   to show up at the site of invasion
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.520]   or infection or inflammation.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.420]   It's called there by various cues,
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.380]   including the cytokines that we've talked about earlier.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.380]   And what it does is it actually attaches to
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.680]   and creates a sort of an imprint of the shape
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.400]   of whatever invader happens to be there.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.580]   So if that particular invading bacteria or virus
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.680]   has a contour that's kind of rippled or kind of spiky
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.120]   or whatever shape it happens to have,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.520]   it creates an imprint of that.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   And then using that imprint in concert with some other cells
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.420]   creates antibodies that are specific
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.240]   to recognize that invader should the body
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.160]   ever have that invader inside of it again.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.760]   Now that's why it's called the adaptive immune system.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.760]   And in many ways, it creates a memory of a prior infection
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.560]   so that these antibodies can be made anytime
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.060]   that same invader comes back again, all right?
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.840]   And so this is the basis of what we call immunity.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.580]   This is the basis of what we call an enhanced ability
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.060]   to combat certain types of infections.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.080]   And it's really a wonderful, and I mean,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.800]   just I can't even state how incredible this really is
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.640]   that all of our bodies have this capacity, right?
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   We have something called leukocytes.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.720]   These are essentially white blood cells.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.600]   We have red blood cells and white blood cells,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.320]   and they both are derived from the same type of origin cell.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.520]   It's a stem cell.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.360]   When you hear stem cell,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.200]   a stem cell just means a cell that can become
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.280]   many different types of other cells.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.080]   We sometimes hear about stem cells
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.840]   in terms of people that are getting injections of stem cells
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.760]   or the potential therapeutic effects of,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.920]   or potential of stem cells,
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.220]   but we all harbor certain stem cells within us as well
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.000]   that can become lots of different cell types.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.120]   And there's one particular type of stem cell,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.040]   which is the hemopoietic stem cell,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.960]   which can give rise to red blood cells
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.380]   and white blood cells.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.960]   And in general, these reside in the marrow,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.180]   at least in adults.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.360]   So in our bone marrow,
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.160]   we have this ability to make certain cells
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.400]   that can go out when they are called out chemically,
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.020]   they're called out to sites of infection
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.840]   and create antibodies and then maintain those antibodies
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.960]   in our system or have a memory of that particular infection
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.040]   so that if the infection comes back again,
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.620]   we can kill it off immediately.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.680]   And it doesn't have to pass through these multiple stages
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.080]   of first the innate response,
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.600]   then the adaptive response, taking some time.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.740]   Now, there are a lot more details
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.360]   to the adaptive immune system,
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.600]   but I just want to emphasize a few points
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.400]   that might be relevant.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   First of all, the name of the antibodies that are created
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.500]   sometimes come in the form of IgM and IgG,
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.760]   things of that sort.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.520]   This isn't a full deep dive immunology class,
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.420]   but Ig stands for immunoglobulin, okay?
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.200]   So the immunoglobulins are part
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.740]   of the adaptive immune response in creating antibodies.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:54.580]   If you hear IgM, the IgM is the first of the adaptive
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.760]   immune responses, and it tends to come on earlier.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.000]   So if somebody is immunopositive for IgM
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.380]   for a particular type of viral or bacterial invader,
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.040]   that means that it was a fairly recent infection.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.160]   Later, one creates the adaptive immune system,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.080]   I should say, creates an IgG,
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.980]   which is the more stable form of the specific antibody
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.840]   that's going to recognize a given invader.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.880]   So IgG tends to come up a little bit later.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.040]   So just to recap, something gets into your system
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.040]   through your eyes, through some hole in your skin,
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.720]   a cut through your mouth.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.120]   Sexually transmitted diseases come in
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.160]   through the mucus membranes that are on the genitalia
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.520]   or in the genitalia.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.760]   Sexually transmitted disease, airborne disease,
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.900]   gets into the mucus, somehow gets into the bloodstream.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.320]   Then there's the innate response,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.960]   which is a more general response of trying to contain
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.240]   and combat the infection or invader.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.000]   And then the adaptive response is the one
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.240]   that generates the antibodies.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.520]   First, the IgM response, the immunoglobulin M response,
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.000]   and then the immunoglobulin G response, IgG response.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.640]   So how do we keep these three barriers
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.920]   or these three defense systems to infection tuned up?
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.640]   Well, leaving aside the list of things
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.180]   that I mentioned before that generally enhances
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.200]   their function, things like sleep and sunlight
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.440]   and good nutrition, et cetera,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.680]   the sort of generic things for good health.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.100]   One of the key ways we can do that is to keep
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.040]   that mucus lining in really good shape.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.860]   And what does that mean?
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.380]   Well, the mucus lining needs to turn over quite often,
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.600]   and it needs to be the correct chemistry
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.440]   to be a trap for the bad stuff
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.560]   and for it to be permeable to the good stuff,
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.240]   to the nutrients that we need.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.360]   And it is now very clear from hundreds if not thousands
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.980]   of studies that the best way to do that
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.340]   is to maintain a healthy so-called microbiome.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.700]   The microbiome being these little bacterial organisms
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.600]   that are good for us that live all along our mucus pathways
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.020]   and even in our eyes.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.420]   Now, just to be really clear,
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.560]   it's not just about the gut microbiome.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.880]   We actually have a microbiome in our eyes.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.520]   We have one that's specific to our mouth.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.320]   We have a nasal specific microbiome.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.960]   There's one all along the gut and the species of microbiota
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.680]   that live all along the digestive tract differ
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.480]   from the mouth to the throat, to the stomach,
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.160]   intestines, and to the rectum.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.720]   It's well established that there are healthy microbiota
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.240]   that live all along that length
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.740]   and they differ along that length.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.760]   There's also a urethral microbiota
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.640]   and there's a vaginal microbiota
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.160]   that promotes health of that environment as well.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.540]   So how is it that one can maintain the healthy microbiota
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.940]   and not favor growth of harmful bacteria
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.820]   or allow that mucus lining to become too permeable
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.740]   to the bad stuff that can come in from the environment?
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.960]   Well, as far as we know,
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.680]   there are three main ways to do that.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.920]   The first two are purely structural and mechanical.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.840]   It's very clear now from work,
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.220]   some of which was done at Stanford, but elsewhere as well,
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.680]   that the nasal microbiome is particularly good
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.840]   at scrubbing bacteria,
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.180]   at preventing certain types of infections.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.920]   So this is a reminder that whenever possible,
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.680]   unless eating or speaking, you want to be nasal breathing,
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.120]   not breathing through your mouth.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.040]   Your nose is a much better filter
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.500]   for viruses and bacteria than is your mouth.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.940]   The mouth contains certain structural features,
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.180]   even organs and cell types that can protect
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.840]   against incoming infection,
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.740]   but you don't want to be a mouth breather
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.060]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.600]   And there's a terrific book called "Jaws, a Hidden Epidemic,"
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.740]   which was written by my colleagues,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.940]   Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.420]   and Stanford Medicine with a forward by Jared Diamond
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.720]   and Robert Sapolsky.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.440]   So it's really a lot of heavy hitters on that book
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.040]   that talks about the increase in infection
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.580]   that one gets when breathing through the mouth
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.640]   as opposed to the nose.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.480]   Now, of course, during hard exercise,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.240]   one reads through the mouth, that's not necessarily bad.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.640]   When one is eating or speaking,
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.400]   that's not necessarily bad at all.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.860]   I guess it depends on what you're saying, it was a joke.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.920]   But in general, when possible,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.640]   you want to be breathing through your nose.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.660]   Many people have trouble breathing through their nose
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.480]   because of so-called deviated septums
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.780]   or chronically collapsed sinuses.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.800]   The best way to dilate those sinuses
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.200]   is actually to breathe through your nose.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.440]   So it can take a little bit of time,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.820]   but there is some plasticity to the sinuses.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.600]   And so be a nose breather, not a mouth breather,
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.540]   you will combat more of the infections
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.080]   that you are constantly confronted with.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.240]   I should mention that we are always bombarded
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.040]   with different types of bacteria, viruses,
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.560]   and parasites in our environment.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.360]   And the goal, of course, is to reinforce your immune system
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.460]   so you can keep these things at bay and not get sick.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.320]   There's actually a paper that was published in Cell Report,
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.780]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.180]   that showed that the nasal microbiome,
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.040]   it has particular species of microbiota
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.360]   that are good at fighting off infection.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.800]   There has not been a direct link
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.420]   between particular patterns of nasal breathing
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.180]   and the nasal microbiome yet,
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.100]   but oxygenation of that environment
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.480]   by breathing through your nose
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.960]   turns out to be quite important overall
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.920]   for enhancing it as a filter.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.520]   So don't just think of your nose
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.800]   as something to smell foods and to bring in air.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.680]   It's also an active filter for things that could invade you.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.880]   The other way to try and keep out bad things
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.440]   and to avoid getting sick is the advice that your mother
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.240]   and certainly my mother gave me,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.440]   which is to not touch your eyes
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.440]   after touching other people or touching other surfaces.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.480]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.720]   we tend to do this subconsciously.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.180]   But the reason to avoid doing that
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.080]   is the eyes are a primary entry point
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.340]   for a lot of bacteria and viruses.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.400]   You're constantly lubricating the surface of your eyes
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   with the so-called lacrimal glands and tears
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.680]   and things of that sort.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.240]   If you've ever noticed when you wake up in the morning,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.120]   you have some sleep in your eyes,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.240]   you're the kind of crusty stuff
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.440]   in the corners of your eyes or on your eyelashes,
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.140]   that sleep, that crust are actually dead bacteria
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.960]   that you've successfully battled during the night.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.800]   That's what that is.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.640]   It's not the accumulation of some healthy tissue.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.080]   It's the accumulation of your healthy mucous membranes
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.200]   and tears and other things that are specifically combating
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.380]   those bacteria.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.040]   So I know that sounds a little bit gross,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.880]   but that's what that is.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.320]   So you're wiping away the casualties of a battle
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.040]   that you fought at night.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.820]   So during the daytime, you don't want to introduce viruses
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.080]   and things to your eyes as much as possible.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.660]   It is a primary site of entry.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.880]   This is why people wear goggles in surgical units
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.800]   and things of that sort to try and avoid getting things
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.840]   into their eyes.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.000]   Very, very important.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.720]   And then the third way to keep a healthy line of defense
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.200]   for your entire mucus tract
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.160]   is to enhance the proliferation of good gut microbiota.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.000]   The best way to enhance the quality of your gut microbiome
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.020]   and the mucus lining that serves as this protective layer
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.520]   all along your body is to ingest two to four servings a day
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.160]   of fermented foods, low sugar fermented foods.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.000]   I've talked about this before a bunch of times on the
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.140]   podcast, but these are data from my colleague,
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.600]   Justin Sonnenberg's lab at Stanford Med.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.120]   And there, I just wiped my eyes.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.040]   Yep, you got me.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.480]   But that a paper published in the journal Cell,
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.400]   which is a absolutely spectacular journal really points
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   to the fact that when people eat fermented foods,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.160]   two to four servings per day,
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.500]   it helps reduce the activity of certain cytokines.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.900]   Now, you know what those are, right?
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.360]   Cells make cytokines to call out,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.160]   help me, help me, to reduce the amount of cytokines,
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.400]   the so-called inflammatome.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.440]   Now that doesn't render those cells more vulnerable.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.120]   The reason they saw a reduction in IL-6 and IL-1
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.400]   and some of these other cytokines is because when people
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.320]   have a healthy gut microbiome,
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.080]   there are fewer cells in the body being infected
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.060]   from outside infections and therefore less of a reason
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.460]   for cells to be crying out help
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.600]   because they are thriving, not suffering.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.240]   So don't wipe your eyes, keep your hands clean,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240]   everyone tells you that, right?
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.120]   But keep your hands clean, don't wipe your eyes.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.200]   Be a nasal breather, not a mouth breather,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.840]   unless you're speaking, exercising, or eating.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.280]   And keep a healthy gut microbiome by eating two
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.720]   to four servings a day of quality,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.960]   low sugar fermented foods, things like sauerkraut,
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.880]   things like natto, if you can access that.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.480]   I've tried it before, it's interesting.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.920]   It's sort of an acquired taste.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.080]   Kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources are going
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.720]   to be the sources that are going
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.880]   to be most effective for this.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.520]   So now you're armed with three ways to enhance the function
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.240]   of your immune system and combat infection that is,
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   I like to think, separate from the typical type
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.840]   of information that you get, such as, you know,
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.300]   get good sleep, good nutrition,
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.520]   good social connection, et cetera.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.800]   All that stuff still holds true,
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.080]   but these three other points I think can really
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.680]   make a substantial difference in terms
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.720]   of bolstering the immune system, your immune system.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.960]   I do want to mention, because these names are going
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.740]   to come up several times during this episode,
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.920]   that while interleukins like IL-6
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.180]   and IL-1 encourage inflammation,
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.700]   they are these help me signals that call in cells
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.000]   to gobble up invaders, there are some interleukins
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.440]   that are anti-inflammatory.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.500]   And the one that I'd like to highlight in particular,
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.520]   because it will come up again in a little bit,
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.200]   is interleukin 10.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.940]   So not all of the IL, insert number,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.440]   not all of the interleukins are inflammatory,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.880]   some are anti-inflammatory.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.380]   So that's important point to keep in mind as we go forward.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.280]   Next, I'd like to talk about what's called
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.700]   sickness behavior.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.580]   And indeed, there is a category of behavior
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.820]   that we call sickness behavior that is very informative
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.920]   as to the things that we can do to avoid getting sick.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.260]   Now, this notion of sickness behavior goes back
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.440]   several decades or more, and it's a very interesting way
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.480]   of looking at the function of the immune system,
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.400]   because what it does is it bridges us from this thing
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.600]   that we're calling the immune system,
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.220]   where it's T cells and B cells and cytokines and leukocytes,
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.720]   and it starts taking us into the realm
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.480]   of the nervous system, because of course,
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.640]   the nervous system controls behavior.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.040]   So sickness behavior is a suite of responses
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.180]   that we tend to all undergo when we are feeling sick.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.640]   So this is going to vary from person to person,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.360]   but there's some general categories of things
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.180]   that we all do and that happened to all of us
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.320]   after we are wounded or sick or dealing with an infection
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.160]   of any kind.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.500]   And by examining sickness behavior in some detail,
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.440]   it can be really informative as to routes
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.980]   that we can take to health.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.960]   So the main thing about sickness behavior
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.540]   is that it tends to involve a slowing
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.540]   of our usual levels of activity.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.500]   People start to feel lethargic or they feel like
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.420]   the activities that previously they could do
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.540]   with relative ease are very difficult for them
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.400]   or somewhat overwhelming.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.440]   The other thing you start to see is that people
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.360]   and animals, by the way, stop grooming.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.880]   They stop taking care of themselves,
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.300]   not necessarily stop showering,
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.640]   although oftentimes that's the case,
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.280]   but they will stop doing their hair.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.820]   They'll stop putting on makeup, you know,
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.880]   depending on whether or not they did that before,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.720]   they might stop.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.040]   Animals will stop licking and grooming themselves.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.760]   People will stop taking care of their cosmetic appearance.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.760]   Now it's not just because they don't care how they look
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.600]   when they're sick.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.280]   It's because there's this overall suppression
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.860]   of certain kinds of activities and an enhancement
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.040]   of other kinds of activities.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.240]   And this is really important.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.980]   Sickness behavior is actually a motivated state.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.720]   It's a state that's designed to accomplish certain things.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.580]   One of the other features of sickness behavior,
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.120]   in addition to being lethargic, loss of grooming,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.800]   will be a loss of appetite, right?
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.360]   Oftentimes people who have a great appetite normally
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.280]   just won't feel hungry at all.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.620]   And there are several theories as to why this would be.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.720]   One prominent idea in the literature
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.960]   is that it's to discourage vomiting and diarrhea,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.360]   which of course can be infectious to other people.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.120]   So that's a theory.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.540]   I don't know that that's ever been tested directly,
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.240]   but that's one idea.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.400]   The other idea is that it's simply to harbor more resources
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.840]   for sake of repair.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.200]   And I want to talk about that
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.140]   because we are all told to get extra sleep
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.440]   when we aren't feeling well or to rest.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.680]   But just like any good two or three-year-old
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.260]   constantly asks why, why?
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.400]   Good scientists, good people who are interested
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.240]   in health information should always be asking why?
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   Why should I get more sleep?
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.880]   What happens in sleep
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.500]   that I should get more sleep when I'm sick?
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.140]   Why shouldn't I just push through this?
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.280]   And there are a couple of reasons for this
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.160]   that have been established in the literature.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.520]   The first is that there does seem to be something useful
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.840]   about slowing circulation when we are ill.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.340]   One idea that has some data to support it
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:28.520]   is that when we slow our circulation, our blood circulation,
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.900]   so not running around so much or running at all,
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.460]   but rather lying down, getting extra rest,
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.240]   maybe sleeping, maybe even just remaining still
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.380]   is that the lymphatic system,
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.560]   which carries a lot of the immune-related cells and fluids
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.560]   is able to ramp up its levels of activity.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.880]   So this is interesting, right?
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.240]   So reducing circulation of the blood,
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.840]   but increasing circulation of the lymphatic system.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.920]   You've all probably been familiar with the lymphatic system.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.640]   When you're combating an infection,
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.340]   your lymph nodes can get sore.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.320]   You've got lymph nodes behind your ears and your groin,
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.920]   your armpits, around your throat,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.560]   around near your thyroid, in your throat, et cetera.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.900]   So that's the other reason.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.880]   Now, some people, when they get sick,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.800]   get psychologically go into a very vulnerable state
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.160]   where they really, really want people,
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.860]   other people to take care of them.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.840]   You've probably witnessed this,
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.300]   or you feel this way yourself.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.660]   About 50% of people have that response.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.360]   They really want to be taken care of.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.000]   Now, when you think about it from an adaptive perspective,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.480]   this makes sense, right?
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.100]   A member of our species is ill,
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.460]   and they more or less will cry out for help
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.840]   in one form or another
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.200]   to the other members of their species to take care of them.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.720]   And of course, this will be especially apparent
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.880]   in cases where people are young enough
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.120]   or incapacitated enough
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.720]   that they can't actually get resources on their own.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   If you've ever been really sick,
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.880]   just getting up and going to the fridge or to the restroom
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.920]   can feel like a monumental task.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   So about 50% of people report or describe seeking of help
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.660]   and support when they are sick.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.560]   But you could also imagine
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.800]   how this would be a very non-adaptive response
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.040]   because it increases the opportunity
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.380]   to spread infection to the caretaker.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.200]   So that's an interesting consideration.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.720]   Another 50% of people seem to have the opposite response
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.560]   when they're sick.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.140]   So somehow, regardless of how they were
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.800]   prior to getting ill,
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.200]   the sickness behavior that's engaged
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.040]   by these neural circuits in the brain,
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.760]   they are indeed neural circuits in the brain,
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.640]   create a stay away from me.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.640]   I don't want to be bothered.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.660]   I want to be left alone.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.240]   I don't want to be taken care of, right?
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.720]   It's not stubbornness.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.840]   It's literally a lack of interest or a disinterest
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.640]   in social connection when one is sick.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.160]   And you see this in animals too.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.920]   Some animals will seek out other members of their species.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.320]   Others, like my unfortunately now passed away bulldog,
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.360]   Costello, when he was sick,
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.160]   I always knew because he would go around
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.720]   in the back of the house and he would just hide there.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.600]   He would just take himself away from everybody else.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.400]   He did not want to be taken care of.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.480]   And it was just a natural response to him.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.840]   I don't think he was trying to prevent me
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.140]   from getting whatever it was that he had.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.400]   So if ever somebody doesn't want to be taken care of,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.640]   or if they do want to be taken care of,
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.400]   realize that people tend to fall into these two bins naturally
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.880]   and animals tend to fall into these bins,
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.840]   regardless of what species they are, it's about 50/50.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.480]   And again, this sickness behavior is a motivated state.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.580]   It's designed to slow circulation of the blood,
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.520]   increased circulation of the lymph
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.320]   and the other killer cells in the body,
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.900]   reduce the probability of infecting others
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.020]   by reducing its thought, diarrhea and vomit,
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.240]   but also breathing on others, interacting with others.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.300]   And in some cases it will activate this,
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.040]   I don't want to call it a regressed state,
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.060]   but many people feel somewhat more if they are adults,
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.380]   they feel more childlike when they are ill
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.340]   and they want to be taken care of very badly.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.300]   Some of it might be learned,
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.620]   some of it might be innate, we don't know,
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.040]   but the sickness behavior is very interesting
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.080]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.120]   First of all, it mimics another state
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.760]   that has been described in the neuroscience literature,
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.540]   which is major depression.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.760]   And in both sick individuals,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.160]   sick from bacterial viral infection,
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.720]   and in people with major depression,
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.760]   it's been shown that there are robust increases
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.720]   in the levels of interleukin-6
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.800]   and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.580]   So there is an idea now circulating that depression
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.580]   involves these inflammatory cytokines being very active.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.380]   And we know that illness
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.180]   involves inflammatory cytokines being very active.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.020]   So if you think about it,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.940]   the similarity between major depression and being sick
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.940]   ought to be able to point us in a direction of interventions
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.660]   that could help us either prevent illness
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.100]   or move through illness more quickly.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.160]   But as we head in that direction,
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.020]   because indeed that's the case,
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.720]   I just want to emphasize that sickness behavior
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.220]   is what provides this bridge between the immune system
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.720]   and the nervous system.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.400]   And what we'll soon see also is that healthy behavior,
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.660]   behavior that allows us to avoid infection
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.320]   also points to a clear bridge
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.800]   between the nervous system and the immune system.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.220]   That it isn't just that we have a brain and body
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.040]   and our organs, and then we have an immune system.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.920]   That's true, but they're interacting all the time.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.960]   And this is going to lead us to a place
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.920]   where it's going to be very clear
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.500]   and not at all surprising how certain patterns of thinking
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.740]   and certain behaviors that we can elect to take
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.680]   can help enhance our immune system function and vice versa.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.180]   There are two other features of sickness behavior
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.260]   definitely worth pointing out.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.680]   One is a theory, which is that the reduced appetite,
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.320]   in particular appetite for protein-rich foods when sick
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.660]   is thought to be an attempt,
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.580]   a subconscious attempt of the organism
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.860]   to reduce the amount of iron that it's taking in.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.460]   Now, typically the amount of iron intake
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.460]   that's recommended or more or less is for men,
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.760]   it's about eight milligrams per day.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.740]   For women, it's anywhere from 18 to 27 milligrams per day,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.220]   depending on whether or not they're pregnant,
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.860]   lactating or menstruating, et cetera.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.080]   The ranges can vary.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.620]   But, and indeed it's true that if iron levels in the blood
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.900]   go too high, like over 45 milligrams per day,
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   can be very toxic to the system.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.740]   But the theory that's prominent in the biology literature
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.020]   and in the health literature is that the reduction
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.180]   in appetite is actually an attempt to reduce iron intake
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:44.220]   specifically because many bacteria
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.860]   and other forms of infection seem to thrive
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.860]   when levels of iron in the blood are high.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   Now, I don't want to see anyone take this to extreme
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.680]   and suddenly do an iron deprivation diet
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.940]   in order to get well.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.160]   But it's an interesting theory that I'd be remiss
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.540]   if I didn't mention, because it makes good sense.
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.780]   Iron is actually attached to hemoglobin
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.760]   and red blood cells in the bloodstream.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.220]   Normally that can help us quite a lot.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.340]   It's also in muscle.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.340]   I should mention that iron can be sequestered into muscle
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.100]   and iron serves a lot of important health promoting roles,
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:24.100]   but by reducing appetite and thereby reducing iron intake,
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.120]   it does reduce the capacity of certain things,
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.300]   including infections to travel
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.580]   in certain compartments within the body.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.320]   So again, that's just theory,
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.580]   but I think many of you are probably familiar
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.480]   with not having an appetite when you're sick.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.940]   The other thing that's very typical
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.160]   of people with major depression is loss of appetite.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.820]   Not always, but often loss of appetite.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.720]   So here again, we have loss of appetite
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.560]   in sickness behavior, loss of appetite in major depression.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.220]   And perhaps not surprisingly,
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.140]   one of the major symptoms of sickness behavior
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.880]   and major depression that map more or less onto one another
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.260]   is loss of libido or interest,
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.720]   not just in social interactions,
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.280]   but in sex and reproduction.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.780]   And so again, if you think about sickness behavior
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.900]   and depression, they are very, very similar.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.720]   Okay, so sickness behavior and major depression
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.280]   have certain core features in common.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.520]   We need to therefore ask ourselves why and how
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.160]   does being sick influence the way that we think
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   and perceive our environment and impact our appetite,
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.420]   whether or not we want to be cared for more
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.400]   or cared for less.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.780]   Again, people tend to diverge
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.040]   into two different bins there.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.340]   And believe it or not,
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.760]   the pathway for this has been identified.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.280]   When we have an infection someplace in our body,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.600]   and it could be up in our head,
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.340]   you know, it could be a sinus infection,
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.920]   it could be an ear infection,
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.740]   or I should also mention many of these same mechanisms
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.780]   can also be the consequence of a wound
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.380]   or an injury to the body,
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.660]   you know, a back injury or a slipped disc,
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.700]   or I guess it's called a herniated disc
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.700]   is the way that you hear it described.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.080]   When we have that, we can be kind of irritable.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.760]   We don't want to do certain things
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.900]   and we just want to be left alone.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.140]   Things are harder, how, why?
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.920]   Well, there's a known pathway,
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.820]   which is the so-called vagus nerve
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.340]   that connects the body and the brain,
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.940]   signals to particular brain sites
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.980]   to engage this category of motivational state
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.540]   that we call sickness behavior.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.780]   Many of you have probably heard of the vagus,
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.480]   V-A-G-U-S, vagus.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.960]   The vagus nerve is a very extensive nerve pathway.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.080]   It's the 10th cranial nerve
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.920]   comes out of the back of the brainstem,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.400]   heads into the body and branches out extensively
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.180]   to innervate or connect to many of our organs,
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.420]   including our lungs, our heart, our gut, et cetera.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.780]   And all of those organs are able also
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.440]   to send neural signals back up to the brain.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.860]   We sometimes hear the vagus
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.600]   as the route to calming ourselves down.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.920]   Unfortunately, that's more or less a myth
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.960]   that I don't know how it got propagated.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.060]   You have lots of different pathways in the vagus.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.560]   Usually vagal stimulation
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.160]   actually creates more arousal and alertness,
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.180]   although it does have multiple pathways.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:23.520]   But there have now been many studies of the vagus
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.900]   in various contexts, including in sickness behavior.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.040]   And it's very clear that the vagus nerve
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:33.640]   is the fast pathway by which an infection in the body
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.840]   is signaled to the brain
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.200]   to a particular location in the brain
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.400]   called the hypothalamus,
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.180]   which harbors a lot of different types of neurons.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.280]   Neurons, for instance, in the preoptic area
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.240]   that increase body temperature and fever, right?
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.560]   That's one of the most important things
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.100]   is to increase body temperature in order to,
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.900]   it's the body's attempt to kill off this invader
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.020]   because many viruses and many bacteria
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.220]   don't survive well at elevated heat.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.520]   That's the function of a fever.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.140]   A fever actually has a functional role.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.940]   So in biology, we like complicated words.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.800]   So we call anything that increases body temperature
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.560]   or creates a fever.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.100]   Pyrogen, many years ago in my undergraduate years,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.680]   I was working on pyrogens, injecting something called
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.660]   lippy polysaccharide into the belly,
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.860]   which then gives you a fever.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.980]   The way it does that is LPS causes an inflammation response
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.000]   in the gut.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.620]   The gut doesn't know what is happening.
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.500]   The stomach cells don't know what's happening.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.860]   So they just start secreting the IL-6, the IL-1,
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.740]   all those cytokines, the killer cells migrate into the gut.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.280]   That's why you sometimes get a stomach ache
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.920]   when you don't feel well, you have a flu
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.980]   or something like it.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.300]   So a neural signal, electrical signals get sent up
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.340]   to the hypothalamus.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.180]   The hypothalamus says,
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.840]   "Oh, I don't know what's going on out there,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.500]   but there's a signal something's going on.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.140]   Let's just heat up the body.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.060]   Let's just start cooking whatever it is out there."
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.800]   And of course, you don't want fever to go too high
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.540]   because you can kill brain cells,
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.480]   but within a particular range,
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.780]   the fever is a functional and adaptive response, okay?
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.720]   So if you're taking drugs to try and lower the fever,
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.140]   that might make you feel more comfortable,
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:14.020]   but actually that's limiting the response
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.060]   that your body is creating
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.900]   in order to try and kill off that invader.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.900]   And again, you don't want fever to go too high.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.420]   This is going to vary depending on age.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.340]   You can look up online
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.220]   what the tolerable ranges are for fever,
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.780]   but when you're trying to lower body temperature,
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.380]   when you have a fever,
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.820]   unless you're heading into dangerous levels of heating up,
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.860]   that's actually the wrong way to take your system
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.180]   if you do indeed want to kill off that invader.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.300]   Okay, so the vagus nerve is the quick response.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:46.700]   It also sends input to areas of the brain
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.200]   that change your perception of the outside world.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.860]   One of the most obvious of these,
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:56.060]   obvious once I tell it to you, is photophobia, right?
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.460]   I love bright sunshine.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.140]   I love bright lights when I want to be alert.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.940]   We all have different levels of light sensitivity,
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.780]   but most people, when they are sick,
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.420]   when there's an inflammation response in the body,
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.640]   they feel like bright lights are kind of aversive.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.060]   They get a well-described kind of classical photophobia.
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.820]   And that's mediated by a pathway that goes from your eye
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.880]   to an area of your thalamus
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.040]   called the anterior nucleus of the thalamus.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.980]   This is work that was done by Clifford Saper
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:27.860]   at Harvard Medical School.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.000]   It's really beautiful work.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.580]   And then from there up to the outer lining of the brain,
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.020]   which is the meninges,
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   just sort of on the outside of the brain
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.420]   where the brain starts to interface
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.380]   with some of the other connective tissues.
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.040]   We'll talk more about these later.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.540]   It can actually create a photophobia and a headache
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.500]   when one is ill.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.580]   So here's the pathway.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.900]   Some invader gets into your system
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.940]   'cause you wiped your eyes or it got in through your mouth.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.100]   You didn't listen to your mother
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.100]   and got in through your eyes.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.200]   You're feeling sick.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.980]   Something's going on there.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.860]   You have a stomach ache
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.180]   because of all the inflammation there.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.540]   The signal goes up from your vagus nerve.
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.320]   You're heating up with a fever.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.240]   You've got photophobia
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.160]   because you've activated this pathway
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.240]   by which what would normally be tolerable light
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.080]   is triggering this thalamic nucleus, the anterior thalamus.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.800]   That's projecting up to the meninges.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.120]   You've got a headache in response to looking at light.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.320]   It's basically triggering an overall pathway
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.400]   to get you to go into a quiet, dark place and rest.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.420]   And the last element I'd like to talk about is the rest.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.440]   There's something that gets triggered
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.940]   from the body to the brain to the hypothalamus.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.460]   And we think we know which hypothalamic area it is.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.740]   It's the supraoptic nucleus, we think.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.260]   Supraoptic 'cause it's right above
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.900]   your so-called optic chiasm.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.100]   If you want to look up where that is,
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.780]   it's right above the roof of your mouth.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:51.780]   And there are nuclei there that promote the desire to sleep
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.280]   even during the daytime,
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.740]   what would normally be the active phase
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.800]   of your circadian cycle.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.060]   Now, that is really interesting
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.500]   because what's happening here
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.560]   is you've got multiple pathways that are saying,
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:08.880]   "Avoid light, reduce your amount of behavior,
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.200]   heat up all the things that are making you sick."
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   This is sickness behavior,
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.600]   and it's going from your body to your mind
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.040]   to make you do the right thing.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.560]   Now, there's also a slow pathway
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.080]   that's purely mediated by the blood,
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.660]   so-called humoral factors, not 'cause they're funny,
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.720]   but humoral factors are factors of the blood.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.720]   As you have an infection for many hours or days,
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:39.540]   the amount of IL-6 and IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.960]   and other inflammatory cytokines is starting to increase
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.540]   such that the total amount in your circulation
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.740]   gets high enough and is communicated to the brain.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.400]   And it tends to enter the brain
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.260]   through a particular type of tissue
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.880]   that's really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.640]   Choroid is really interesting.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.260]   It's kind of this fluffy tissue that sits in your ventricles.
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.120]   The ventricles are the spaces in your brain,
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.520]   and the spaces in your brain
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.900]   have what's called cerebral spinal fluid in them.
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:10.760]   The cerebral spinal fluid
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.400]   contains a number of important things,
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.080]   but the choroid starts releasing and responding
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.640]   to these cytokines, the inflammatory cytokines,
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.320]   and then the brain actually starts to experience
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.340]   all sorts of changes in terms of inflammation to neurons.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.040]   Your memory tends to get poor.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.280]   Your cognition tends to get poor.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.960]   These are transient things most often.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.580]   Eventually these things will pass,
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.960]   but this is deep into sickness
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.320]   when you're really feeling lousy.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.880]   You can't read, you can't watch a movie,
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.720]   you can't do anything.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.160]   So if you ever get sick
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.620]   and you just can't be bothered by anything,
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.380]   it's probably because you've had that fast response
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.320]   from the body, and you've also had this slower response
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.920]   where you literally have a set of tissues in your brain
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.260]   that are sending out these inflammatory signals,
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:58.880]   and now your whole brain is starting to cope
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.880]   or is trying to cope with this infection.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.280]   So you've got a slow pathway and a fast pathway.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.480]   That all sounds really terrible.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.160]   So now I'd like to talk about what you can do
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.500]   to reduce the probability of getting sick,
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.600]   and there are actually things that one can do
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.120]   as you start to get sick and once you're sick
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.320]   to accelerate the healing process by flipping the equation.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.200]   Up until now, we've been talking about how the body
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.960]   activates certain areas in the brain to create sickness
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.920]   behavior that's very much like depression.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.080]   You're probably all familiar with this
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.640]   from any time you've had a cold or a flu
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.900]   or something really lousy or an injury.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:39.080]   Now let's flip the equation and ask,
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.880]   what can we do with our nervous system
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.120]   in order to enhance the function of our immune system
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.280]   in order to be able to heal and recover
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.560]   from illness and injury more quickly?
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.600]   So let's say you are in that unfortunate circumstance
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.000]   of waking up one day or coming home
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.980]   and you've got that tickle in your throat,
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.600]   or when you breathe, your nasal passages
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.760]   don't feel the same way.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.820]   You've got a little bit of a headache.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.160]   You're feeling kind of off.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.320]   We all know what we should do.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:12.080]   We should all hydrate, drink some water and go to sleep.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.360]   Right, that's what we are all told.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.200]   But there are actually things that you can actively do
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.400]   in order to get your immune system
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.860]   to deploy a more robust response
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:27.700]   at that early phase of potential infection.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.740]   Let's focus first on the rest component.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.520]   Yes, of course, we are all told
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.720]   that we should take a hot shower and go to sleep
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.700]   and get nine or 10 hours of sleep,
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.280]   but there's an interesting way of looking at sleep
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.080]   specifically for its role in enhancing the immune system.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.540]   And there's a wonderful review.
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.220]   I'll put the review in the captions
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.020]   that looked specifically at the literature
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:59.240]   surrounding sleep that is different
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.720]   because it occurs in support of the immune system.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.140]   So normally when we go to sleep,
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.640]   we have slow wave sleep predominantly
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.920]   in the early phase of the night.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.160]   And then over time, as we sleep longer and longer,
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.520]   we get more so-called REM, rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.200]   Talked all about this on the episodes on sleep.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.200]   Of course, you have slow wave sleep and REM sleep
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.440]   throughout the night always,
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.580]   but it's the fraction of slow wave sleep to REM sleep
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.860]   that shifts and they have different functions, et cetera.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:26.260]   There is some evidence that the sleep
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.120]   associated with an infection,
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.660]   in particular early stage of infection,
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:36.220]   is associated with elevated levels of serotonin in the brain
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:39.140]   that either through an adaptive mechanism
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:41.500]   or for whatever reason, the brain,
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.920]   the neurons in the brain of the so-called raffae nucleus
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.380]   start releasing more serotonin.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.300]   And that that serotonin and its related pathways
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:53.820]   can help enhance some of the immune system function
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:56.160]   that could combat the infection.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.540]   There is starting to be some data,
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:00.920]   and I emphasize starting
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.480]   because it's not a very robust literature yet,
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.520]   looking at whether or not supplementing precursors
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.240]   to serotonin like 5-HTP,
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.480]   which can be taken in a supplement form,
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   or consuming foods that increase serotonin naturally.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.300]   So these would be any foods
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.780]   that contain high levels of tryptophan.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.960]   You can look up what those are.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.160]   So white meat, turkey, for instance,
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.480]   certain complex carbohydrates
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.440]   can often be rich with tryptophan.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.040]   That consuming those foods can enhance
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.660]   the amount of serotonin that's available
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:35.980]   in the brain and blood,
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.200]   and thereby lead to the particular quality of sleep
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.440]   that allows for more deep healing,
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.240]   or for, when I say deep healing,
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.160]   I mean for a more robust immune response.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.880]   Now, again, those are still emerging data.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.040]   What is very clear, however,
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.200]   is that during sleep, and in particular during sleep,
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.920]   that's associated with the early stage
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.620]   of any kind of viral or bacterial infection,
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.480]   the so-called glymphatic system
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.020]   is much more active than it would be normally.
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.400]   What's the glymphatic system?
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   The glymphatic system
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.500]   is actually a relatively recent discovery.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.000]   I mentioned lymph and the lymphatic system earlier.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.520]   The glymphatic system, with a G,
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:20.080]   is a system in the brain by which debris
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.240]   that accumulates throughout the day,
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.940]   but in particular debris that accumulates
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.200]   under conditions of neuroinflammation
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.840]   and inflammation of the body,
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.080]   is cleared out or is washed out of the brain.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.280]   And the activity of this glymphatic system
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.200]   is extremely important
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.780]   for the recovery from infection of any kind.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.880]   And it's now becoming clear,
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.820]   is important for recovery from traumatic head injury
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.880]   and maybe even from psychological trauma.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.320]   So the glymphatic system can be thought of
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.680]   more or less as a plumbing system
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.160]   that runs through the ventricles,
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.620]   but also mainly through the lining
[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.680]   that sits between the brain and the skull
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.020]   and some of the other tissues and things of that sort.
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.160]   The choroid is involved as well.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.220]   Brain imaging reveals that the glymphatic system
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.640]   is very active during deep sleep
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.400]   and there's this kind of washout of the glymphatic system.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.440]   And I'm aware of some studies that are ongoing now
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.240]   where augmenting the serotonin system
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.680]   through either supplementation of tryptophan or 5-HTP
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.600]   or even serotonin itself, these are laboratory studies,
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.080]   is being looked at for its capacity
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.520]   to increase the amount of circulation
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.980]   in the glymphatic system.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.600]   And the idea is that it might, and I want to underscore,
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   might potentially lead to more rapid recovery
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.040]   from injury and illness and potentially ramp up, if you will,
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.820]   the activity of the immune system.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.620]   So it essentially is a ramping up
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.300]   of the activity of the immune system.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.660]   Now, regardless of whether or not you decide to,
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.060]   for instance, supplement with 5-HTP before sleep or not,
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.260]   I'll talk about what that might look like in a moment,
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.440]   there is a way that you can increase the activity
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.160]   of your glymphatic system under normal circumstances.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.660]   Because of the mechanics of the glymphatic system,
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.720]   it turns out that if you elevate your heels
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.000]   by about 12 degrees, it doesn't have to be exactly 12,
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   as you sleep by putting maybe a rolled pillow
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.800]   or two pillows underneath your feet,
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.460]   by having the head below your legs,
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.080]   it seems that there's more glymphatic washout
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.960]   or clearance during sleep.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.600]   And this is without taking any compound
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.160]   to adjust the serotonin system.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.420]   So I would say, if you're not feeling well,
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.600]   yes, take the hot shower.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.640]   Yes, get into bed and go to sleep,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.960]   but elevate your feet to try
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.660]   and increase the activity of the glymphatic system.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:41.100]   Some might even consider that if you have to be awake,
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.960]   that you might want to be awake with your feet elevated
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.000]   above your head.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.960]   Now, that might not be practical for the workplace,
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.640]   but it might be practical for a short nap during the day
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.780]   or something of that sort.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.280]   The glymphatic system is not just active during sleep,
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.400]   it's also active during certain phases of waking,
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.000]   in particular, when we are in a deep state of relaxation.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.200]   So as many of you probably know, I'm a big proponent
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.800]   of self-hypnosis
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.260]   because of the quality scientific literature on this.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.840]   If you're interested in self-hypnosis,
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.960]   you can go to Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.960]   Reveri is a cost-free app for Apple and Android
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.080]   that was developed by my colleague, David Spiegel,
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.380]   and others at the Stanford University School of Medicine
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.240]   based on quality studies and peer-reviewed data,
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.580]   showing that deep states of relaxation
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.960]   can be used to improve pain management,
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.720]   improve transition time to sleep,
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.400]   and a number of other things.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.040]   You can select the various sort of outcomes
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.920]   that you're seeking using Reveri.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.320]   It's a great thing that,
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.860]   especially for people that are challenged
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.320]   with meditation could use
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.560]   because you just listen to the script,
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.080]   involves deep relaxation.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.640]   I would suggest using that script,
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.800]   or the script for sleep,
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   but with feet elevated to increase activity
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.040]   of the glymphatic system.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.000]   Now, if you do decide that you want to test out
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.180]   this serotonin hypothesis on your own,
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.540]   obviously check with a doctor.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.920]   I'm not a doctor, I'm a professor,
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.720]   so I'm professing things, not suggesting things.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.620]   But 5-HTP is a supplement that I've talked about before
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.360]   on this podcast that I actually do not recommend
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.400]   for most people for sake of sleep,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.240]   because it can disrupt the normal architecture of sleep
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.540]   and create a deep sleep early in the night,
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.980]   and then a spontaneous waking
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.760]   with some trouble to get back to sleep.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.840]   And that's because of the way that the serotonin system
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.920]   and the melatonin system interact.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.880]   However, under conditions where one is feeling
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.200]   like they might have an infection
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.540]   or an early stage of illness,
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:35.800]   in that case, 5-HTP might be a useful supplement
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.200]   in order to access these states of sleep
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.720]   that are not typical.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.820]   They're not the typical deep sleep that you would achieve
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:43.880]   when you're feeling healthy.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.140]   These are states of sleep that are specifically there
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.420]   in order to try and repair some of the immune system
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.560]   related inflammation that's occurring.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.700]   If you'd like to explore the 5-HTP approach
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.780]   and you feel it's right and safe for you,
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.560]   and you've talked to your doctor,
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.420]   it's 300 to 500 milligrams taken about 30 to 60 minutes
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.360]   before going to sleep for the night.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.580]   That's the typical protocol.
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.440]   Not incidentally,
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.740]   increasing serotonin is also one typical approach
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.080]   for the treatment of major depression.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.960]   This is the basis for things like SSRIs,
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.840]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.440]   like Prozac and Zoloft and so forth.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.860]   The 5-HT approach is a much milder approach
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.520]   than prescription drug, of course,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.240]   but will allow more serotonin to be synthesized
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.400]   and/or released.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.900]   Now, for those of you that are interested
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.660]   in learning more about the glymphatic system,
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.140]   it's a fascinating system,
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.820]   and you might want to do a deep dive there
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.360]   in terms of the behavioral protocols
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.200]   and what's known about it.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.320]   There's a wonderful article called "The Glymphatic System,"
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.560]   a beginner's guide.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.180]   This is a scientific article.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:59.480]   The first author is Jessen is the last name, J-E-S-S-E-N.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.960]   If you put in Jessen, the glymphatic system,
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.800]   a beginner's guide,
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.300]   you can access the full-length manuscript easily online.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.240]   It'll show up immediately in your search.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.120]   And in a really interesting way,
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.480]   the glymphatic system has now also been tied
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.220]   to the iron deposition system.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.640]   Earlier, we were talking about iron
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.080]   and how, of course, getting enough dietary iron
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.960]   is important, but if levels of iron are too high,
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.120]   it isn't good for a number of reasons.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.920]   There's a very interesting article
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.360]   that just came out last year
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:34.140]   called "Dysfunction of the Glymphatic System Might Be
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.000]   Related to Iron Deposition in the Normal Aging Brain."
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.920]   So we're starting to see these links
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.640]   between iron levels being too high,
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.360]   the glymphatic system not being active enough,
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.760]   and so forth, leading to sickness behavior,
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.480]   inflammation, and maybe even damage to neurons
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.080]   associated with aging.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.440]   We can flip that on its head and say that
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.920]   increasing the activity of the glymphatic system,
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.440]   feet elevated during deep sleep,
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.160]   maybe even feet elevated above the head,
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.400]   while awake during a nap or doing a reverie script
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.400]   once a day or something of that sort,
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.740]   could increase the activity of the glymphatic system,
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:18.740]   lowering iron to a point that's probably below
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.720]   the typical intake during periods of infection,
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.840]   perhaps, perhaps I should say,
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.480]   can enhance the glymphatic system and vice versa.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.440]   And then you've got this specialized sleep
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.700]   that's related to sickness behavior
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.480]   that seems to have heightened levels of serotonin
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.840]   that might be augmented by increasing, excuse me,
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.920]   that might be augmented by ingesting 5-HTP.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.880]   Again, not on a regular basis.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.060]   I don't suggest that people take compounds
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.120]   that increase serotonin unless it's prescribed to you
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.700]   for depression or something,
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:55.180]   but not doing it by supplement with tryptophan or 5-HTP
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.720]   on a regular basis, but only under conditions where,
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.080]   as I mentioned, you might be starting to feel sick
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.140]   or you're coming down with something
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.500]   or you're combating some sort of infection.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.680]   So if we consider the advice that we typically get
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.600]   when we're not feeling well of take a hot shower,
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.360]   get into bed and go to sleep,
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.420]   and we've now touched on ways to potentially increase
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:17.120]   the efficacy of the sleep part through the glymphatic
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.480]   and the serotonin system.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.120]   What about the take a hot shower part?
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:20.940]   Is that good advice?
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.780]   Well, it turns out it is,
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.080]   and there's actually a way to do even better.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.780]   There's a study, very interesting study.
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.640]   The title reveals where I'm going with this.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.500]   It's effect of a single finish sauna session
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.280]   on white blood cell profile and cortisol levels.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.440]   In this case, it was done in athletes and non-athletes,
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.340]   which is kind of nice.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.240]   This involves taking athletes and non-athletes
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.000]   and exposing them to sauna.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.720]   It wasn't particularly hot.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.960]   It was 96 degrees, which isn't cool, but it's not really hot.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.840]   Nowadays, you hear about people doing very, very hot sauna.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.480]   The humidity of the sauna, if you want to know,
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.200]   is 15 plus or minus 3%,
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.640]   but basically what they found was that just
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.280]   one 15-minute sauna session
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.520]   could really increase white blood cell profiles
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.960]   and could adjust cortisol levels in ways
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.760]   that were beneficial for combating infection.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.060]   And now there are many other studies like this.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.940]   Now, this should immediately make sense
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.540]   based on what we said before about fever.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.780]   Heating up can actually help combat infection.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.920]   But for those of you that have listened
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.820]   to the episodes on temperature,
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.920]   what you probably know is that when you get into a sauna
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.320]   or any kind of hot environment,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.540]   your body is also going to be actively pushing
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.160]   to cool itself off.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.720]   So there's probably an increase in heat,
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.280]   there is an increase in heating,
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.320]   that then afterwards your body will cool off,
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.400]   maybe even with a dip below baseline.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.520]   I do want to provide a cautionary note
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.880]   that if you are already running a fever,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.240]   getting into a sauna could take your body temperature
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.740]   into dangerously high levels,
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.480]   dangerously meaning you can kill neurons.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.960]   And once you kill neurons, they do not come back.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.720]   So please don't kill your neurons.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.900]   I don't recommend getting into a sauna
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.180]   if you're already running a fever.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.900]   So this would be something to do
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.600]   at the initial stage of an infection
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.340]   or if you're feeling a little bit off.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:04.020]   So this is kind of a ramping up or a super protocol
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.740]   of the typical advice of take a hot shower
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.160]   and get into bed, that is good advice.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.440]   Now we're talking about a hot sauna, probably showering off
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.320]   and then getting into bed, maybe augmenting serotonin.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.520]   I know many people don't have access to sauna.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.600]   So in that case, a very hot bath or shower,
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.100]   don't scald yourself of course,
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.600]   but as hot as you can comfortably tolerate
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.200]   or right at that edge of what you can tolerate
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.360]   would be a good idea.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.280]   Some people I've heard are creating saunas
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.320]   in their bathrooms by running hot water
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.440]   and creating a ton of steam.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.520]   Anything that really heats you up
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.100]   but not to dangerously high levels is going to be beneficial.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.240]   If you have access to a sauna, terrific.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.820]   This again was only 15 minutes.
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:47.800]   They'd had a cool off session.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.160]   Would you get more of an increase?
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.920]   People always want to know if you did it twice as much,
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.380]   would you get twice increase?
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.760]   Those data don't really exist yet.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.360]   However, if you are interested
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.600]   in maximizing the effects of sauna,
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.540]   it is clear that a cool off period is important.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.320]   So it's not that a 15 minute sauna is good
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.880]   and a 30 minute sauna is better.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.080]   If you are going to take that route of exploring more,
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.400]   it does seem that doing a 15 minute heating period
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.600]   followed by a five to 10 minute cooling period
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   and then getting back into the heat can be beneficial.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.580]   And this is interesting.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.400]   It gets to the mechanisms by which the hypothalamus
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.980]   that areas, the areas of the hypothalamus that is
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.220]   that generate increases in body heat.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:32.560]   The activation of those neurons occurs as you heat up.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.500]   And then were you to just stay in that heated environment,
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.680]   they would actually shut off
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.720]   and some other neurons would be handling the job,
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.640]   so to speak.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.180]   But by getting in and out of the heated environment,
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:45.420]   you actually force that system to send repeated pulses
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.800]   of these cortisol lowering
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.320]   and white cell stimulating signals to the body.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.000]   Some of you have probably heard the phrase,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.200]   feed a fever, starve a cold.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.920]   I don't know who first said that.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.380]   I couldn't find the citation, but we hear this
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:05.440]   and we can speculate that the reason that phrase,
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.140]   feed a fever, starve a cold came to be
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.740]   is because of the adaptive function of fever
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.320]   that increases in body temperature make it challenging
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.120]   for intruding viruses and bacteria to survive.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.080]   Even though of course, highly elevated body temperatures
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.600]   pose a danger to the host organism, to you.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:31.000]   Feeding, eating does cause an increase in body temperature
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.440]   through the so-called thermogenic effect of food.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.700]   So I can understand the logic of feed a fever.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.660]   It would mean that when you have a fever,
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.240]   it's your body's natural attempt to heat up
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.100]   and kill some invading thing.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.040]   And by eating,
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.900]   you would further increase your body temperature.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.180]   Why you would want to starve a cold, I don't know, however.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:55.240]   Maybe it's because when your nasal passages are congested,
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.020]   it's uncomfortable to eat or something of that sort.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.900]   So the feed a fever part makes sense to me
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.860]   that the starve a cold part is still mysterious to me.
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.820]   I couldn't find any logical reason why that would be good.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.800]   There are communities out there that believe that fasting
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.720]   is a viable way to combat certain types of infection.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.340]   Fasting, in particular prolonged fast,
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:21.500]   do increase the amount of adrenaline,
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.260]   also called epinephrine in the brain and body.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:27.900]   And as we will next explain, epinephrine,
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:31.020]   adrenaline does have a powerful effect
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.220]   on the various inflammatory cytokines
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.340]   and on the immune system in general.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.140]   So let's talk about a behavioral protocol
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.160]   that anyone can use.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.660]   It doesn't involve any equipment.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.220]   You don't need a sauna.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:45.620]   You don't need anything at all that has been demonstrated
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.540]   in excellent peer reviewed research
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.940]   to enhance the function of the immune system
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.900]   and actually allow people to combat infection
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.740]   in very dramatic ways.
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:58.860]   Next, I'd like to do an in-depth analysis of a study
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:01.740]   that has achieved some prominence out there,
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.060]   not just in the scientific literature, but on the internet,
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:09.480]   because it relates to how particular types of breathing
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.580]   can impact the immune system
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.620]   and the ability to combat infection.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.820]   The title of this paper is voluntary activation
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.580]   of the sympathetic nervous system
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:23.980]   and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.220]   This is a paper that was published in PNAS,
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.060]   which is the Proceedings
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.080]   of the National Academy of Sciences USA.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.180]   It's a very prestigious journal.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.500]   For those of you that know PNAS,
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.580]   you know that there are certain papers published in PNAS
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.340]   or there used to be that were not peer reviewed.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.180]   In recent years,
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.300]   I think all of them have moved to peer reviewed papers.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:46.340]   So this is a peer reviewed, very high quality study.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.140]   And I just want to describe the basic contour of the study.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.340]   I'll explain the findings,
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.660]   and then I want to go in depth
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.780]   and explain the mechanistic basis for these findings
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:00.040]   and the protocol that we can all export from these findings.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.820]   So here we go.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.480]   First of all, a couple of terms
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.380]   so that everybody is on the same page.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.040]   The sympathetic nervous system
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.460]   is one division of our nervous system.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.680]   It's a set of neurons down the middle of our spinal cord
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.900]   and in our brain that generally lead
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.980]   to a heightened state of arousal and alertness.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.520]   It's associated with epinephrine release in the brain
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.640]   and adrenaline release in the body.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.820]   It's the so-called fight or flight system
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.380]   when it's really active,
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.240]   but it's the system that's active when we are wide awake.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.820]   And we already talked about the innate immune system.
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:39.620]   That's that first line of defense
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:42.100]   after the skin barrier, of course,
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.620]   whereby some infection comes into the body
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.660]   and there's this rapid response of increasing inflammation.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:52.060]   And that's also about the time that you first feel lousy.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:52.900]   So when you start to feel like,
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.140]   oh, I think I've got something.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.620]   I don't feel right, a headache.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.840]   I feel nauseous, I'm heating up.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.680]   I don't feel good.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.900]   That's the innate immune system kicking in.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.220]   That's what they did in this study.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.700]   And by the way, I should say they,
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:10.840]   this is the first author is Cox, K-O-X,
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.540]   last author, last name Pickers, P-I-C-K-K-E-R-S.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:20.160]   What they did was they exposed human subjects
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.700]   to an endotoxin by, in other words,
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.300]   they injected people with E. coli.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.400]   There's a bacteria which makes people,
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.300]   all people feel terrible.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:36.300]   See nauseous, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, very unpleasant.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.060]   These people voluntarily signed up for this study.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:42.640]   However, some of the subjects in this study
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.140]   performed a behavioral protocol
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:50.700]   that can best be described as cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.180]   My lab works on these types of breathing protocols.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.620]   This is not work that my lab did,
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.800]   but basically subjects hyperventilate
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.100]   followed by breath retention, by breath holds.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.180]   And I'll explain exactly what they did.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.560]   They also looked at other forms of behavioral protocols,
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.020]   but let's focus on that one.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.820]   So they're comparing controls
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.080]   that do just sort of a basic meditation
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.400]   versus people that do this intense breathing
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.840]   followed by some breath holds.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.440]   I'm just paraphrasing here.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.480]   In the intervention group, the breathing group,
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.540]   plasma levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.720]   So this is a cytokine that lowers inflammation,
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:32.120]   increased after endotoxin administration.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.800]   And that was triggered by an increase
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.060]   in epinephrine and adrenaline.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:37.900]   So in other words,
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.500]   doing a particular pattern of breathing
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.340]   allowed an anti-inflammatory cytokine to be turned on,
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.420]   whereas that was not the case in the subjects
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:49.860]   that did not do this particular breathing protocol.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:53.700]   And they discovered that levels of pro-inflammatory
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.380]   TNF alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha,
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.420]   IL-6, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8,
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:01.240]   which you should all be familiar with now,
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.620]   as pro-inflammatory cytokines
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.560]   were lower in the intervention group,
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.760]   whereas these IL-10 levels
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.560]   that are anti-inflammatory went up.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.640]   Finally, flu-like symptoms
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.480]   were lower in the intervention group.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.740]   So this is an amazing finding, right?
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.320]   These are human subjects.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.280]   One group of subjects is doing this breathing protocol.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.420]   The other group of subjects is just meditating.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.320]   They both, both sets of subjects
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.520]   have been injected with E. coli.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.520]   So you know everyone's getting the same amount
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.480]   placed into their system.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.720]   This is very, very interesting.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.960]   And it leads to the question that every good scientist,
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.280]   two-year-old, or health information seeker asks,
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.500]   which is why, how?
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.760]   How in the world does this work?
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.960]   Why does this work?
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.720]   Well, to make a long story short-ish,
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.000]   because I am going to go into depth here,
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.960]   the reason it works is because
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.880]   the sympathetic nervous system,
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.780]   the so-called stress part of our nervous system,
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:01.640]   it's not really called that,
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.120]   but the part of our nervous system that triggers stress
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.420]   from mild stress to severe stress, even to panic,
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:11.360]   causes the release of adrenaline and epinephrine
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.040]   in the brain and body.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.260]   And under normal circumstances,
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.480]   when we have some sort of invading infection,
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.960]   our body is able to push back on that,
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.920]   to resist it by engaging the stress response.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.940]   So what's happening here is there's a behavioral protocol
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:29.440]   involving the nervous system,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.640]   'cause all behaviors are generated
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.360]   from the nervous system, of course,
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.200]   a behavioral protocol that people are deliberately employing
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.800]   that allows them to activate the sympathetic nervous system,
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.580]   which in turn allows them to activate the normal pathways
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:48.320]   by which immune system function is enhanced, okay?
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.480]   Now, the reason I'm underscoring this
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.260]   is that the common interpretation of this study
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.880]   is that somehow it blocks the normal immune response,
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.740]   but that's not really what's happening here.
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.500]   Yes, there's a reduction in inflammatory cytokines
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.380]   and there's an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines,
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.300]   but that's not really the same thing
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.580]   as blocking the immune response.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.460]   This could just as easily be viewed
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:14.080]   as enhancing the immune response
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:18.100]   and combating the intruder, in this case, E. coli.
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:21.920]   So let's parse this study a little bit more closely.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:24.880]   First of all, what is this magical pattern of breathing?
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.300]   Some of you may recognize this
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.100]   as so-called Wim Hof breathing.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.780]   Wim, of course, the Dutchman,
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:32.660]   I think his occupation online used to be listed as Daredevil,
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:34.060]   believe it or not, on Wikipedia.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:37.340]   That's a pretty cool occupation.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:42.340]   Wim is best known for his activities with cold exposure.
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:44.980]   He holds multiple world records for that,
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:48.460]   swimming under icebergs and other incredible feats
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.780]   that you definitely don't want to try
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:52.380]   unless you're extremely skilled
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.700]   and really know what you're doing as he does,
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.860]   but also for the use of breath work.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.400]   The breathing that is so-called Wim Hof breathing
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.340]   is very similar, not exactly the same,
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:05.380]   but very similar to Tummo breathing
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:07.380]   as it's been described historically.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.720]   In the science and physiology community
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.540]   and in my laboratory, because I run a university laboratory,
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.620]   we refer to it as cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:17.900]   which just means repeated deep breaths in and out,
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.340]   and then there are these retention.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:23.100]   So I'm, because I'm here in the hot seat anyway,
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.860]   I might as well demonstrate it for you
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.120]   so you know what this looks like.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.380]   There are variations on this.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:31.080]   So with respect to Wim, with respect to Tummo practitioners,
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:34.100]   with respect to the cyclic hyperventilators everywhere,
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.980]   this is one general theme of it.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:40.380]   It involves 20 to 30 deep inhales
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.820]   and then exhales through the mouth,
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:47.740]   followed by a exhale of all one's air and a breath hold.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.780]   That's the retention.
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:53.300]   And then at some point, 15 to 60 seconds later,
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:55.460]   repeating the 25 or 30 breaths,
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:59.020]   and then again, a breath hold with lungs empty.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.440]   There are variations on this,
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.460]   but in our laboratory and in this particular study,
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.940]   it looks something like this, okay?
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.360]   I'm not going to do the whole thing right now,
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.100]   but it goes something like this.
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.260]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:20.900]   Okay, so let's assume I did that for 30 breaths.
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.820]   I can already feel myself perspiring a little bit.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.220]   You're heating up, that's the release of adrenaline.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.560]   It's caused by that breathing pattern.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.980]   And then exhaling all of one's air,
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.860]   no speaking in between like I'm doing.
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.020]   [exhales]
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:37.780]   And then sitting, lungs empty,
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:39.820]   until one feels the impulse to breathe,
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:42.100]   and then repeating for several rounds,
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:43.720]   two or three or even four rounds.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.900]   Now, some people will also introduce
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.420]   a big inhale and breath hold at the end
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.740]   and find that indeed they can hold their breath
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.000]   much longer than they normally would be able to,
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.580]   because the trigger to breathe is normally activated
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.240]   by increases in carbon dioxide.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.540]   In our blood, we have neurons in our brain stem
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.220]   and in our various regions of our brain, actually,
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.200]   that respond to when carbon dioxide is too high
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.700]   and trigger the reflex to breathe.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.940]   But when we exhale deeply,
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.820]   we blow off a lot of carbon dioxide
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.820]   so we don't feel that impulse to breathe come quite as soon.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:21.020]   Basically, this study looked at people doing
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:24.400]   these cyclic hyperventilation with retention,
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.700]   25 or 30 breaths, then the retention,
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.520]   25 or 30 breaths, then retention, 25 or 30 breaths,
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.360]   then the retention.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.360]   So three rounds of 25 to 30 breaths
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:37.160]   followed by exhale hold in between of various duration,
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.940]   but in general, 15 to 60 seconds is typical.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:43.400]   What happened physiologically?
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.280]   This is one of the reasons I like this study.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.780]   What happened physiologically?
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.460]   Well, a couple of things.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.740]   Of course, blood oxygenation drops.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.360]   You would expect that based on hyperventilation
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.820]   and especially based on the exhale
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.100]   of so much carbon dioxide.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:59.200]   We could explain why that is,
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.540]   but blood levels of oxygen drop.
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:08.540]   The pH, the alkalinity of the body goes way up.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.100]   This is very interesting.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.380]   If you look up this paper,
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.500]   you can look at figure one, panel C.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.700]   The pH goes way up.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.800]   People become alkaline.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.220]   You've heard before of alkaline water.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.060]   I hate to say this.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.540]   I probably lose some friends for this,
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:24.100]   but yeah, don't waste your money on drinking alkaline water.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.380]   You can't really shift the alkalinity of your body.
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:30.300]   There are cases where some compartment in your body
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:31.920]   needs to be more alkaline than the rest.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.500]   Your gut is a different alkalinity
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.780]   than other areas of your body, et cetera,
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.260]   but ingesting high alkaline water
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:41.300]   isn't going to shift your overall alkalinity.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.120]   If someone can send me a quality reference
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.900]   that shows different,
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.420]   then I'm happy to revise that statement,
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.720]   but in any case, doing that pattern of breathing
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.500]   that I just described greatly increases the pH.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.700]   Greatly, I should say,
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.320]   it doesn't send it off into dangerous levels.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.400]   It takes it from 7.4 to 7.6,
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.220]   which is a significant increase in alkalinity.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.460]   So as pH levels,
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.580]   for those of you who remember high school
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.060]   or college chemistry,
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.700]   as the numbers on the pH go down,
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.140]   you're becoming more acidic.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.980]   As they go up, you're becoming more alkaline, okay?
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.060]   Or more basic.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:18.900]   So the subjects went from 7.4 to 7.6 during the breathing,
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.660]   and then afterwards it returned to normal.
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:22.780]   But that shift in alkalinity
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.920]   is thought to be important here.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:25.860]   So what's going on here?
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:30.660]   How is the breathing leading to these shifts in,
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:35.060]   or I should say reduction in inflammatory cytokines
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:38.740]   and an increase in the liberation
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.220]   of these anti-inflammatory cytokines?
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:43.420]   Well, the authors make some good arguments
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:47.740]   as to why it's not the shift in pH per se,
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:51.980]   or the shift in carbon dioxide levels in the blood,
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.580]   but rather it's the release of epinephrine.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.700]   There's some good reason to believe why that's the case.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.140]   It's beyond the scope of this discussion,
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.260]   but that it's actually the release of epinephrine,
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:03.780]   AKA adrenaline,
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:07.140]   that's causing this reduction in inflammation.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.580]   And that's actually supported
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.340]   by something that you've probably experienced before,
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.140]   which is if you've ever worked, worked, worked,
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.020]   worked really hard,
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.180]   or you've been a caretaker for somebody else
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:21.540]   or studying for exams and people around you are getting sick
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.660]   and you're just powering through it
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.900]   and you're not getting sick, but then you stop,
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.520]   you turn in your final exam,
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.880]   you stop taking care of somebody else,
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:32.300]   or you finally stop and rest or you go on vacation
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.020]   and then you get sick.
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:37.860]   Well, you've just experienced the effect
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.120]   that adrenaline, epinephrine can have
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.000]   in activating your immune system
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   by way of the nervous system
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.680]   in order to keep fighting and combating infection.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.440]   And that brings us to a larger theme,
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.940]   which is that stress and combating infection or a wound
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:56.460]   is not one unique system.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.740]   It's the same stress system
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:00.080]   that you use to combat psychological stress.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.800]   So when you're very, very stressed,
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.620]   at least in the short term,
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.640]   because you release so much adrenaline and epinephrine,
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.300]   you're actually better able to combat infections
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.680]   and you reduce inflammation
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.580]   and the whole feeling lousy response, right?
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:14.780]   Remember, reduced flu-like symptoms here.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:18.060]   So this pattern of breathing is actually a very useful tool.
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:19.920]   And I confess, I use this pattern of breathing
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.560]   anytime I am at the initial stages
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.760]   of getting some sort of bug.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.400]   If I feel like I've been running myself ragged
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.440]   or if I somehow, for whatever reason,
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.720]   have a tickle in my throat
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.900]   or I have that kind of sensation in my nose,
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:35.300]   like I might've caught a bug of some sort,
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.740]   I will do this pattern of breathing.
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.300]   I've been doing it consistently,
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.680]   gosh, for the last four years or more.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.140]   Now, this is just anecdotal reports,
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.880]   but I find that it allows me, indeed,
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.700]   to either have those early symptoms disappear
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.540]   or it allows me to just kind of push through
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:55.740]   and harder longer.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:59.260]   I don't suggest people continue to push through
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:00.580]   exposure to infections.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:03.080]   Obviously, you don't want to infect other people,
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.340]   nor do you want to crash
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:07.220]   and suddenly get a massive illness of some sort
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.100]   because you stopped doing this breathing.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:10.780]   But I do think it's a useful tool.
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:13.140]   It's a purely behavioral intervention
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.160]   that has been shown here.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.800]   And now there are additional studies on the way
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.140]   to enhance the function of your immune system
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:22.700]   and to reduce inflammation.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:26.060]   And this is, to me, one of the most concrete examples
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:31.060]   of a zero cost tool that bridges the activation
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.840]   of the nervous system through breathing
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.180]   with the immune system by way of releasing adrenaline
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:41.660]   and thereby reducing the terrible effects
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:45.600]   or feelings of lousiness from a,
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.020]   in this case, an E. coli infection.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:52.220]   Now, I'd like to focus on a couple of important points
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:55.800]   that I haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere,
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.620]   which is that the hyperventilation
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.640]   and the breath retention are both important.
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   So you can't simply hyperventilate to get this effect
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:09.180]   at the level of epinephrine release
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.820]   and reduction in inflammatory cytokines.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:15.220]   It's been shown before that the hyperventilation phase
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:19.900]   and the hypoxia, which is a kind of low oxygen saturation
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:21.980]   due to the breath retention,
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:26.080]   they both combine to increase epinephrine adrenaline levels.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.000]   So you have to do the 25 or 30 breaths
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.200]   and then the retention, 25 or 30 breaths,
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.100]   then the retention, meaning that the exhale
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.700]   with the breath hold in order to get the full effect.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.780]   I also want to provide a critical cautionary note.
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:43.700]   Don't do this anywhere near water or while driving a car.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.580]   These things might seem kind of obvious,
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:49.700]   but obviously in the off chance that you black out
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.260]   or something like that, it could be disastrous.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.340]   So please be careful.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.540]   And again, don't try and push the breath hold.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.940]   The moment you feel the impulse to breathe, just breathe.
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:01.020]   And it did seem that the three rounds
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.360]   of 25 to 30 breaths with interventions, excuse me,
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.600]   with breath hold retentions in between
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.500]   was the ideal protocol.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.580]   There's one last very interesting feature of this study
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.940]   that I want to emphasize.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:15.460]   And that was that they actually measured
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.980]   the so-called catecholamine concentrations.
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:20.660]   Catecholamines are things like dopamine, epinephrine,
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:25.220]   norepinephrine, these are chemicals in your nervous system
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:28.580]   and body that promotes states of alertness.
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.140]   Dopamine of course, part of the reward and motivation
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.720]   pathways.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.100]   They explored the levels of these molecules in blood,
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:41.100]   in plasma, during and after this breathing protocol.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.180]   And as interesting, as I mentioned before,
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.500]   epinephrine showed robust increases compared
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.520]   to the control group.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:49.480]   Norepinephrine, significant increases occurred
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:53.660]   in the breathing group, but in the cyclic hyperventilation
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.900]   retention breathing group, of course, but less so.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:01.600]   And dopamine levels actually dropped somewhat.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.860]   But this is very interesting because there's a new
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:09.860]   and emerging literature, largely from ISA, A-Y-S-A,
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:13.380]   Rolle's lab in Israel.
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:18.380]   What her laboratory has shown is that motivational state
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:24.340]   and mindset has a powerful impact on various aspects
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:27.220]   of the immune system that were thought to be independent
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.380]   of the brain and mind and thinking.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.840]   So this brings us back to something that we discussed
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.220]   at the very beginning of this episode,
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:37.140]   which is that 20, 30 years ago,
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.420]   the idea that you could heal the body with the mind
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.500]   was considered kind of quackery.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:45.300]   I think that there was an intervening period up until now
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.100]   where people might've said, sure, if you're stressed out,
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.180]   it's going to make things worse.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.920]   I mean, I think everyone agrees that stress
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.440]   makes everything worse at some level.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.240]   Outcomes to neurodegeneration, performance
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:00.480]   in physical endeavors and mental endeavors.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:04.360]   If stress is too high for too long,
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.460]   people experience different challenges
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.880]   and essentially every major psychiatric disorder,
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.020]   everything suffers.
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:13.880]   But in the short term, stress can actually be beneficial
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.180]   in the ways that we just described.
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:18.220]   And stress, if we break it down,
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:20.840]   is really a neurochemical state, right?
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.280]   It's the release of these catecholamines.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:26.720]   And what ISA roles as laboratory has shown
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.880]   is that when the so-called dopamine system,
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.240]   and at several episodes I described
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:32.720]   there are multiple dopamine systems,
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.260]   but the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:38.800]   involving areas like the nucleus accumbens, et cetera,
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:43.540]   when the reward system that's associated with dopamine
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.980]   and norepinephrine is activated,
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:50.900]   you see incredible effects, including for instance,
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.920]   highly significant reduction in tumor size in cancers.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.520]   Now, why would that be?
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:02.520]   How is it that mindset, dopamine and tumor growth
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:03.600]   are somehow linked?
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.200]   We now know how this occurs,
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:09.180]   largely through the incredible work of ISA roles and others.
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:13.120]   So now I'd like to turn our focus to how it is specifically
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.280]   that certain mindsets impact the immune system
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.460]   in ways that we can actually point
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.160]   to specific biological pathways
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.720]   and also specific protocols related to mindset.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.640]   I guess a simple way to frame all this would be to say
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.160]   that most of us are aware that yes, indeed,
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.340]   you can worry yourself sick.
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:33.180]   We've been told that.
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.120]   You're going to worry yourself sick.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.800]   And actually there was a paper published in Science,
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.920]   again, one of the top three journals out there,
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.120]   the top three really being Nature, Science and Cell,
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.520]   and then other, of course, excellent journals exist.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.440]   But this was a paper that came out in Science last year.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:53.520]   First author is Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A,
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.480]   describing psychogenic stress and fever.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.360]   So this was looking or asking the question,
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:05.060]   are there areas of the brain that actually underlie
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:07.960]   this notion that we can worry ourselves sick?
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.840]   And they discovered a new pathway
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.660]   and they were able to both activate this pathway
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:16.240]   independent of worry and stress and see illness occur.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.160]   And they were able to inhibit this pathway,
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.220]   block activity in this neural pathway
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.840]   and prevent psychogenic fever
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.120]   and the worrying of oneself sick.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.760]   So they were able to do this in a very controlled way.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.920]   I'll just mention the pathway
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:34.260]   in case you want to look it up in more detail.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:37.520]   This is a corticolimbic pathway.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.980]   So for just to orient us,
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.720]   the cortex is more or less the outer shell of the brain.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.560]   It's involved in thinking and sensation
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.520]   and perceptions and learning
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.040]   and maintenance of a lot of memories are stored there.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.760]   We all hear that you learn and remember in the hippocampus.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.040]   That's the initial side of learning and memory.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.620]   But then that information, believe it or not,
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.460]   is passed off to the cortex where it's stored
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:01.840]   in kind of a long-term hard drive type storage.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.840]   So the corticolimbic pathway is one in which your thoughts,
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.200]   your prior experiences can literally in a structural way
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.720]   feed down onto the areas of the brain
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.800]   that control very basal processes,
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.080]   including temperature regulation.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.320]   So this is a corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.680]   We talked earlier about the hypothalamus
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.660]   as controlling temperature
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:25.160]   and a lot of sickness-related behavior, right?
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.840]   Remember, vagus up to the hypothalamus
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.000]   and all the sleep more, less appetite, fever, okay?
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.400]   That's all in the hypothalamus.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:36.400]   This is a top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway,
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.040]   and it has a fancy name.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.880]   It's the dorsopeduncular cortex, dorsotonia tecta.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.880]   The short of that is the DPDTT.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.920]   So let's just call it the DPDTT
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.800]   to the dorsomedial hypothalamus.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.160]   Not a lot of Ds.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.320]   It shouldn't mean anything.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.160]   Doesn't really matter what we call it,
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:59.040]   but what's important is conceptually,
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.400]   it's a pathway that originates in sites of the brain
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.800]   that are associated with thinking,
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.440]   with emotion and with prior history,
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.380]   and feeds directly into an area of the brain
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.460]   that's involved in basic physiological
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.640]   subconsciously controlled processes.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.240]   So that's incredible, right?
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.300]   And it points to a physical pathway
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.600]   by which the way we think about something
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:23.720]   changes something core about our physiology.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.680]   Now, in some ways that shouldn't be surprising, right?
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.360]   If you think about something that excites you,
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.820]   your heart rate can increase.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:30.040]   You think about something that terrifies you,
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.060]   your heart rate can increase.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:33.560]   So the idea that thinking controls our physiology
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.280]   is not a new concept at all,
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:38.420]   but somehow human beings,
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:41.360]   we have been challenged with the idea
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.640]   that we could actually think ourselves into being sick.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:48.160]   But this paper from Kataoka shows that
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.320]   if you expose somebody to a psychological stress,
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.440]   you can actually activate this pathway and create a fever.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.280]   And how did they do that?
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.720]   Well, you can do this by exposing subjects
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.920]   to a very stressful real event
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.040]   and you cue it through associative learning.
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:07.960]   So maybe like my pilot V5s, which I love so much,
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.280]   we could traumatize me to the pilot V5
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.880]   if I had some horrible experience happen to me
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:14.480]   while I'm looking at and concentrating on the pilot V5,
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.980]   then you take away the horrible experience,
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.220]   you give me the pilot V5,
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.880]   and I start to experience a lot of the symptoms
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.360]   associated with that terrible event.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.320]   They were able to do this
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.600]   using sickness-inducing stimuli and so forth.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.280]   They did all the various derivations
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.100]   and identified this pathway that when activated,
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.160]   even in the absence of some horrible event,
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.800]   could create fever and illness-like behavior and so forth.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.540]   And if they blocked certain stations
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.560]   along this neural pathway, they could block that effect.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:48.320]   So this is really concrete evidence, proof, if you will,
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.280]   that there are dedicated pathways in the mammalian brain,
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.760]   your brain and mine,
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.620]   that allow us to turn thoughts into illness.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:58.240]   That's kind of a depressing idea.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.520]   What about the inverse?
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:02.260]   What about turning thoughts into health?
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:04.580]   Well, that's the work of ISA roles.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.600]   They explored the well-established psychological phenomenon
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:15.600]   that when cancer patients or very ill people
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.600]   or people who are suffering from very debilitating injuries,
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.600]   when they had or when people had or reported a sense of hope,
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.660]   their rates of recovery were much higher, right?
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:29.640]   Sounds very subjective.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:32.040]   But what is a sense of hope?
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.840]   A sense of hope is a sense of the future.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.960]   A sense of the future is tightly associated
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.640]   with the dopamine system.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.940]   Dopamine, again, being this molecule of reward
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.880]   and motivation and movement,
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.880]   but movement and motivation are about things
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.800]   that are beyond the confines of our skin
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:51.400]   and are about the future.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:54.120]   And so what they've discovered and through other studies
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.360]   from other groups have discovered is that stimulation
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.520]   of the dopamine pathway,
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:02.120]   either simply by thinking about a future,
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.380]   ideally a positive future,
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.060]   but thinking about a positive future leads to activation
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.560]   of this so-called mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.720]   and could reduce the size of tumors,
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:13.560]   could accelerate wound healing,
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:18.340]   could greatly accelerate the passage from a state of illness
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.200]   to a state of health and wellbeing.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:24.020]   So there are many, many studies now starting
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:27.240]   to wick out related to this.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.700]   There's also the idea that augmenting the dopamine system
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:33.200]   can increase the rate of healing.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.680]   And so there are individuals out there who opt, for instance,
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.820]   to take things that increase dopamine.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.220]   Now, obviously drugs of abuse would not be a good idea
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.240]   in this context, even though they increase dopamine,
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.300]   they lead to big crashes,
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:48.000]   they have addictive properties, et cetera.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   I've talked before on this podcast about things
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.440]   like L-tyrosine, take it anywhere from 500
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.420]   to 750 milligrams, can increase dopamine
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:00.100]   because tyrosine is a dopamine precursor, of course,
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.060]   things like micuna purines, which are L-DOPA,
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.200]   the immediate precursor to dopamine.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.460]   Some of these will lead to somewhat of a crash
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.420]   in certain individuals,
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:10.560]   other people tolerate them a little bit better.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.820]   Again, you have to talk to your doctor,
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.120]   you have to figure out what's right for you.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.200]   If you have bipolar or mania or schizophrenia,
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.240]   these things are, I would not recommend them at all.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.360]   I'm not recommending them all,
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.600]   I'm just mentioning them for potential exploration
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.200]   if it's safe and right for you.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.420]   But the point is this, the dopamine system,
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:30.140]   when activated, can accelerate healing.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:34.160]   It can accelerate the recovery from injury of all kinds.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.420]   And that shouldn't come as a mystery
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:39.460]   or a surprise result to us.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.920]   It's because this reward pathway
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.160]   and the fact that it's related to a sense of the future
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.400]   seems to liberate entire systems within the body
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.760]   that make inflammatory cytokines go down
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.580]   and anti-inflammatory cytokines go up,
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:40:00.300]   exactly as was demonstrated in the beautiful PNAS study
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:04.000]   where breathing, cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.600]   was used to increase epinephrine, increase norepinephrine,
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.760]   and to augment the catecholamine system.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.560]   So I think that the bridges between these studies
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.400]   are really relevant.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.160]   In one case, I'm talking about potentially
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.340]   taking an over-the-counter compound
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.240]   to increase dopamine to accelerate healing.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:24.340]   In another case, we're talking about using breathing.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:27.620]   There's also the use of cold water exposure
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:28.540]   to increase dopamine.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.260]   I talked about this several episodes ago,
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.000]   but it's been shown that cold water,
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.960]   immersing oneself in cold water up to the neck or so,
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.800]   how cold?
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.000]   Well, it depends on what you can tolerate,
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.280]   but uncomfortably cold,
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.160]   but not so cold that you become hypothermic.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.840]   But where it's challenging to get in,
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.240]   but you can stay there for three to 10 minutes or so,
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.240]   has been shown to lead to very significant doubling or more
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.640]   of baseline dopamine levels and epinephrine levels
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.840]   that go on for several hours.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.180]   This may be the basis for why people will do cold showers
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.080]   or ice baths and then get into a sauna,
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.860]   so what's called contrast, cold heat contrast therapy,
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.300]   as a way to augment these neurotransmitters.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.160]   Today, we've been talking about how these neurotransmitters
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.900]   can be used to enhance the function of the immune system.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:17.820]   And so just keep in mind that anytime you're talking about
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.300]   increasing neurotransmitter levels,
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:22.140]   that can be done pharmacologically through supplementation,
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:24.500]   or it can be done behaviorally through exposure
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.300]   to cold water, for instance,
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:29.180]   or it can be done even just simply by breathing
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.060]   in a particular way,
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.860]   cyclic hyperventilation followed by retention.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:36.380]   The catecholamines, noradrenaline, dopamine,
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.740]   and norepinephrine are the bridge of activation
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:42.340]   for the immune system and the nervous system.
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:44.460]   They are the way that the nervous system calls out
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.780]   to the immune system.
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:49.260]   Aha, we have a problem, we need to counter this.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:53.020]   So you can think of them, them meaning dopamine,
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.860]   epinephrine, and norepinephrine,
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:59.860]   as being able to deploy larger amounts of immune cells,
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.060]   all the types of immune cells that we talked about
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:04.080]   at the beginning of the episode.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:06.940]   Okay, so thus far, we've been discussing
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:09.860]   how one can prevent getting sick
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:12.700]   or when one starts to feel ill,
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:14.660]   how one might be able to shorten the course
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:17.380]   of that infection by ramping up the activity
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.940]   of the immune system.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:22.400]   But what about when you're already experiencing symptoms,
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.580]   the runny nose, stuffed up nose, congestion, headache,
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.820]   et cetera?
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.380]   Well, there are many ways to address that
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:31.560]   at the symptom level.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.040]   You're probably aware of all the over-the-counter
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.040]   medications, many of which focus on the epinephrine system.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.140]   Things that are of the Sudafed variety prevent
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:46.020]   or reduce congestion because of the way
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:48.500]   that they cause release of epinephrine.
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:52.160]   And some of the effects on dilating the bronchioles
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.500]   and dilating the nasal passages and so forth.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:57.460]   I'm not going to speak to whether or not
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:59.140]   those are good or bad choices.
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:02.120]   They do have a couple of effects that are not so great
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:05.620]   for the course of treating the underlying cause,
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:09.120]   which are, first of all, they can cause dehydration.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.860]   So you have to make sure that you're hydrating well
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:13.540]   both fluids and electrolytes.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:16.800]   And they also can interfere with sleep
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:20.320]   because as I've talked about in the episodes on sleep,
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.960]   one of the hallmarks of deep sleep and in particular REM
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:27.160]   sleep is that epinephrine adrenaline levels are low.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.800]   This is what allows you to have intense,
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.740]   often very emotionally laden dreams during REM sleep
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:36.340]   and not act those out.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:40.080]   And low adrenaline epinephrine during REM sleep
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.320]   is basically a signature, a neurochemical signature
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.080]   of the REM sleep state, which is so vital
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:48.120]   for emotional and physical repair and so forth.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.440]   So the fact that they can inhibit sleep,
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.520]   the fact that they can cause dehydration,
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.360]   the fact that they can make people feel kind of lightheaded
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.360]   and jittery makes them not terrific choices
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.000]   for a number of people.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.120]   There is an interesting alternative choice.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:04.080]   And when I say alternative, I do mean alternative.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.620]   The choice that I'm referring to is spirulina,
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:09.000]   which is actually a form of algae.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000]   Years ago, I think when I first heard about spirulina,
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.220]   it sounded very much of the kind of 1970s, '80s
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.260]   health food store variety.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.920]   It seemed really kind of mystical and wacky,
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.400]   but actually now there are some really nice studies
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.200]   and some data and also an understanding of the mechanism
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:27.960]   by which spirulina can have potent effects
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.880]   in reducing what's called rhinitis,
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:33.400]   which is a fancy word for congestion of the nose
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.780]   and inflammation of the nose.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:39.780]   Basically, anytime you hear a word that includes itis,
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:41.800]   at least if it's in the medical or health context,
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:44.160]   it generally means inflammation of some tissue.
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.620]   So rhinitis just being inflammation of the nasal passages,
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.480]   but that's one of the most uncomfortable symptoms
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.040]   of any kind of infection.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:54.300]   So there are two studies I'd like to highlight
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:55.140]   just very quickly.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:58.200]   One is the effects of spirulina on allergic rhinitis.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.000]   And the other is a clinical comparison
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000]   to the efficacy of spirulina platensis,
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.600]   that's a technical name,
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:10.600]   and cetirizine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.560]   These looked at humans, so this is not a mouse study,
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.820]   this is a study on humans.
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:18.760]   Both sexes, so males and females,
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:22.240]   in one case looking at 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects,
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.680]   the other 65 subjects, so a decent number of subjects,
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:27.440]   randomized trial, double-blind.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.440]   Both cases saw significant decreases in nasal obstruction,
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.200]   improved ability to smell, improved sleep,
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.280]   daily working, inflammatory cytokines were reduced as well,
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:44.420]   reduction in nasal itching,
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.520]   all the stuff that you'd like to experience, I can imagine,
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:50.560]   after taking two grams, two grams, not milligrams,
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.740]   but two grams of spirulina,
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.180]   sometimes had to be taken for a short while
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:56.720]   before the effect kicked in.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.440]   So that's pretty impressive, I would say,
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.280]   but it doesn't really speak to mechanism,
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.720]   but in exploring the underlying mechanisms
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:08.240]   for spirulina's effects on reducing rhinitis,
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.680]   it's interesting to find that spirulina
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.800]   actually can inhibit the formation and/or activity
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.520]   of so-called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.580]   We haven't talked a lot about mast cells,
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:23.760]   but they are a very interesting cell type
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.560]   in the immune response.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:29.480]   Essentially, what they are are little packets of histamine,
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:34.480]   and when we have some sort of injury
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.440]   or irritant, rather, to the skin,
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.240]   so a mosquito bite, for instance,
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.100]   or poison oak or poison ivy,
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:44.800]   something that causes an itch
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.040]   or something that causes inflammation internally,
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.540]   doesn't just have to be on the skin,
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.400]   these mast cells are these little bubbles
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.800]   that contain histamine that go to that site
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:56.160]   and release their histaminergic contents
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.220]   and cause swelling and inflammation of whatever cells
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:01.640]   are affected locally.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.000]   That's cause, you might think,
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.960]   well, why would I want to have a mechanism in my body
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:06.720]   that would cause swelling and inflammation?
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:11.080]   Ah, well, then those cells in turn send out cytokine signals
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:14.960]   that recruit the very cell types that we were talking about
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.600]   way back at the beginning of the episode,
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.440]   the cells that are characteristic
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:21.700]   of the innate immune system that come in,
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:24.240]   the macrophages and the other types of cells
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.920]   that will come in and gobble up the foreign invaders
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.840]   or will help sequester and move away,
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.000]   say, the poison from a bite or from whatever irritant.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.880]   Again, it doesn't just have to be at the skin surface.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.720]   I'm describing an example at the skin.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.140]   For instance, if you've ever had hives of any kind,
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:47.040]   that almost certainly involved mast cells.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.680]   So when you take an antihistamine, antihistamine,
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:53.360]   in order to deal with seasonal allergies, for instance,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.760]   you're dealing, you're, excuse me,
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:58.680]   you're taking a compound that's reducing histamines
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.320]   in mast cells, and spirulina has also been used
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:04.900]   quite effectively as a way to treat seasonal allergies
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:07.560]   and some of the symptomology equally on par
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.040]   with some of the major prescription
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.360]   and over-the-counter drugs for that.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.960]   One cautionary note, spirulina does,
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:16.600]   can carry some side effects for people
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.080]   that have a genetic mutation
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.320]   leading to something called PKU.
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.400]   These people know who they are.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.600]   They're very sensitive to phenylalanine.
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:26.920]   The same people cannot drink any sort of
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:30.080]   nutris read or diet soda for reasons that they understand.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:30.960]   It can be quite dangerous.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.280]   It's a rare genetic disorder, but nonetheless,
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.380]   spirulina can be an issue for those people.
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:40.280]   For most people, the side effect profile is pretty minimal.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.040]   And just to be clear, I don't have any relationship
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.720]   to spirulina company or anything.
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.440]   I just find it interesting that there are these compounds
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.040]   that sound rather, forgive the phrase,
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.480]   but rather new-agey because they come from algae,
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.320]   from a plant.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.660]   But when you look at the underlying mechanism,
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:56.960]   it makes perfect sense.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:59.440]   So that's often what we like to point out here
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:02.460]   is that if there are these so-called alternative therapies,
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.000]   alternative because most people haven't heard of them,
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]   it's always nice if they map to a specific logical mechanism
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.840]   and framework by which that compound would work
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.480]   as opposed to just some anecdote of,
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:13.480]   "Oh, I hear spirulina is great for allergies."
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:14.540]   Well, now we know why.
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:17.280]   It inhibits mast cells and histaminergic mast cells
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:18.760]   in particular.
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:22.340]   Earlier, I mentioned a new and very exciting study
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.520]   published as a full article in Nature.
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:28.440]   Full article means that it is a major finding.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.660]   At the journal Nature, they have letters,
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.060]   which are important findings.
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:34.000]   They're still very high stringency
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.560]   for getting a letter in Nature published.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.760]   But the full articles,
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.880]   generally there's only one or two per issue
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:44.680]   in the weekly edition of Nature.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.720]   And just last week, there was a very exciting article
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:51.360]   published from Chufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.320]   Chufu, I've known for a number of years,
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.760]   his group has done phenomenal work
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.480]   on the mechanisms of itch and pain
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.520]   and discovering some of the receptors and pathways
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.360]   for itch and pain.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.400]   And more recently, they've been exploring
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.620]   the mechanistic basis of acupuncture.
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:07.600]   And the title of the article is,
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.680]   "A Neuroanatomical Basis for Electroacupuncture
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:13.120]   to Drive the Vagal Adrenal Axis."
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.160]   And while that's a mouthful,
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:18.520]   now most all of you are probably familiar
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.480]   with what I mean when I say vagal adrenal axis.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.480]   Vagal, meaning of the vagus,
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.260]   and adrenal of the adrenal glands.
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.920]   And so perhaps we should not be surprised,
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:30.200]   although excited nonetheless,
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:35.200]   that Wen-Chufu's lab looked at stimulation
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.640]   of the body with so-called electroacupuncture.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.800]   So these are needles
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.560]   where a small bit of electrical current,
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.140]   low level of electrical current,
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:47.500]   is passed into the needle and therefore into the body.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:50.140]   They located sites on the body
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.460]   that can increase inflammation
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:55.080]   by way of releasing inflammatory cytokines.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.600]   These areas included the abdomen.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.160]   And they found areas on the body,
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:03.580]   such as the lower limbs or the hind limbs in this case,
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:07.340]   that can stimulate the vagal adrenal reflex
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:10.740]   and can lead to reduced inflammation.
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:14.400]   And what was really interesting is that they figured out
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.200]   that it was activation of nerve endings
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.080]   that resided in the fascia.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.560]   I mentioned earlier what fascia is,
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:21.440]   but just to remind you,
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.180]   the fascia is a really thick sheath of tissue
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.920]   that surrounds muscle.
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.560]   If ever you've heard of rolfing,
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:31.400]   rolfing is a form of very intense massage.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.200]   I've never had this done, but I've heard about this.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:37.040]   It involves, among other things,
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:40.800]   actually separating the muscle away from the fascia somewhat.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:43.460]   So it's a very, very deep tissue massage.
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:47.040]   Actually, a good friend of mine who had this done
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:50.840]   told me that it was probably the most challenging experience
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.820]   that physical experience that he'd ever been through
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:54.220]   going through this rolfing procedure.
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:57.120]   Maybe some of you have been rolfed, as they say,
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.000]   and can report to the experience
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.580]   whether or not it was pleasant or unpleasant
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.100]   or you felt benefits or not.
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:04.920]   In any case, this study isn't about rolfing per se,
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.520]   but it is about the fascia.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.320]   And so what they discovered is
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.500]   there's a specific population of neurons.
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:13.120]   Those neurons have a name, as they often do in science.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.200]   Name isn't important, but if you want to look it up,
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.200]   it's the Prok R2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2 neurons.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.460]   And they send a connection deep into the limb fascial tissue.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:27.880]   Okay, and then they send another connection.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:29.480]   The connections we're referring to
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.880]   are axons, neurons have axons.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.320]   So a wire in one direction
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:37.800]   that goes into the deep fascial tissue of the lower limb
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.440]   and near the calf and thigh.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:44.020]   And then they send another wire up into the spinal cord
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.860]   and to a region of the hindbrain
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.400]   in the back of your brain, kind of near your neck,
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:51.140]   called the medulla, in the medulla oblongata.
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:53.520]   That neuron also has a name called the DMZ, doesn't matter.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.800]   And that neuron connects to the adrenal gland
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:59.800]   to release our good old friends, the catecholamines,
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:04.080]   noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine, or norepinephrine,
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:06.300]   epinephrine, and dopamine.
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:11.300]   And their release causes a reduction in inflammation,
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:13.640]   even in response to an injection
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:15.160]   of something called lipopolysaccharide,
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:16.360]   which can actually induce fever.
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.260]   So what is all this saying?
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:21.440]   This is saying that activation of the deep fascial tissue
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:26.440]   causes a chain of neural reactions that leads eventually
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:30.200]   to the release of norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline,
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.440]   and dopamine, and once again, lowers inflammation,
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.880]   very much like the breathing study
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:37.000]   that we talked about earlier
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.660]   in the pattern of cyclic hyperventilation with retention,
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:41.720]   leading to reductions in inflammation.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.320]   I can't tell you how happy this makes me.
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:44.620]   I had nothing to do with this work,
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:45.840]   but the reason it makes me happy
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.320]   is because I have a particular fondness
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:53.240]   for when practices that have existed for many centuries
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.760]   or even thousands of years, such as acupuncture,
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:59.960]   such as respiration work, start to converge
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:02.740]   with some of the hardcore mechanistic science.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.580]   And the reason this excites me
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:06.320]   is not because we want to take science
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:09.340]   and erase the previous tools and methods
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:11.660]   of these ancient practices, not at all.
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.900]   And it certainly isn't the case
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.800]   that we just want to name things
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:17.140]   or rename things with modern science.
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:20.840]   What's very exciting is when we can discover mechanism
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.640]   that explains why certain practices work.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.440]   First of all, that validates those as legitimate practices,
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:31.240]   maybe even insurance will start to cover them,
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:33.080]   whereas maybe they previously had not.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.520]   I don't know what the current status is
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.720]   for insurance coverage of acupuncture.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:38.440]   I'm guessing there are places that do it,
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.400]   maybe others that don't.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:43.360]   I personally am not somebody who receives acupuncture.
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.200]   I have in the past,
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.360]   but it's not that I'm a particular fan of it,
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:48.720]   but I think that there are a number of people
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:51.600]   that have benefited from it, so I think that's wonderful.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:54.240]   Breath work and respiration work is something
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.400]   that I've cultivated as a practice over the years.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.880]   I mentioned earlier how I use it to push back
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:00.720]   on incoming infections and so forth.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:04.320]   And now that doesn't sound like total,
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.960]   like just a figment of my imagination.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:09.080]   There's actually a published mechanism to explain it.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.600]   But the most exciting thing to me about all this
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.080]   is that practices that traditionally have been shrouded
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:17.480]   in complicated language or were the unique domain
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:21.180]   of the practitioners and relied on phrases
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:23.840]   like the meridians or the chakras,
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:25.820]   of which I think is perfectly valid language,
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:27.320]   but doesn't inform mechanism.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.980]   And then in a separate community,
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:32.380]   the community I come from, the community of scientists,
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:35.880]   have used language like our two neurons,
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:38.320]   medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis,
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.720]   and basically no one can communicate with one another
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:41.960]   because the language is shrouding.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:46.560]   What we're now starting to see is that at their convergence
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.120]   is a common mechanism.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.060]   And with that understanding, what's going to be
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:55.060]   really terrific is as new protocols start to emerge.
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:57.340]   So in understanding mechanisms and pathways
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:01.340]   and in being able to understand the base set of practices
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:04.120]   like breathing, like electroacupuncture and so forth,
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.980]   we can now start to daydream in a very realistic way
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:10.280]   about the development of new protocols,
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:11.660]   more effective protocols,
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.780]   protocols that perhaps one can do at home without needles,
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:17.240]   perhaps protocols such as the breathing
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.820]   that you can do anywhere, anytime,
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:21.560]   and be confident that you're actually impacting
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.620]   the IL-6 and the IL-8 pathways,
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:25.780]   reducing those and increasing IL-10.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:29.160]   So we are no longer wandering around in the fog,
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.140]   hearing about these magical techniques
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:32.540]   without understanding why they work,
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.900]   nor are we just seeing a bunch of science
[01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:38.020]   that is descriptive but not mechanistic
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:39.700]   or pointing to specific protocols.
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:41.340]   So I'm just delighted.
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:42.800]   Again, I had nothing to do with this work,
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.800]   but really terrific work, Chufu and colleagues.
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:50.220]   And I also want to acknowledge a journal
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.580]   as prominent as nature for featuring this upfront
[01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:55.580]   because I think it really does mark the beginning
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:58.920]   of a new path in medicine.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.220]   And just to underscore that point a little bit further,
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:03.880]   the National Institutes of Health, of course,
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:05.780]   has a cancer institute, an eye institute
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:07.460]   that deal with trying to combat cancer
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:10.420]   and to cure blindness and so forth.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.800]   And now they have what's called NCCIH,
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:14.560]   which is complementary health.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:18.060]   And so there are good tax dollars being put
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.120]   to the kinds of explorations that we're talking about
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.260]   that undoubtedly are going to lead to better treatments
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:26.480]   for immunological diseases, neurological diseases,
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.020]   the convergence of the immune system and the nervous system,
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:30.480]   very exciting times.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:32.660]   And I hope that by learning about some of this new
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:35.780]   and emerging science and hearing about some of the protocols
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:38.720]   that are either zero cost or low cost,
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:41.220]   certainly for respiration, that's the case,
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:43.100]   or for the use of heat or cold,
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:45.020]   or maybe even electroacupuncture,
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.380]   if you have access to that,
[01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:50.060]   that we can really see that we're starting to evolve
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:52.280]   as a field of health and medicine and science
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:53.260]   and ancient practices,
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:54.920]   and that they're really starting to converge
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:56.400]   and have a vector, as we say,
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:59.140]   in a new and more exciting direction.
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:01.220]   Once again, we've covered a lot of information.
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:02.780]   Today, we learned about the immune system,
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:05.320]   the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system,
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:07.660]   and the nervous system and how those interact.
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:10.700]   And throughout, we discuss protocols that can allow you
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:12.480]   to tap into this relationship
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.620]   between the nervous system and immune system,
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:18.240]   and hopefully avoid and/or shorten the course
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:21.220]   of any illnesses, injuries, or inflammation
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:22.960]   that you might encounter.

[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.160]   and in many previous episodes, I mentioned supplements.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:10.780]   Not everybody needs to take supplements,
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:13.000]   but many people find benefit from them.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.800]   A key thing if you're going to take supplements
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:16.780]   is to know that the quality of the supplements
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:19.220]   that you're taking is very high.
[01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:21.500]   And that's not always the case with many supplement brands.
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:25.340]   That's why we partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:26.640]   Thorne supplements are known to be
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:27.960]   of the very highest quality,
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:31.660]   and the specificity of the ingredients is very high as well,
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:32.820]   meaning what they list on the bottle
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.860]   is actually what's contained in that bottle.
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:36.060]   They've worked with the Mayo Clinic,
[01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:37.200]   all the major sports teams.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:40.480]   So trust is very, very high with Thorne products.
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:42.040]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:47.040]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.240]   And there, you can see all the supplements that I take.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:51.540]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:53.800]   And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,
[01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.000]   you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000]   That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.940]   to see the supplements that I take
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:08.120]   or get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:10.920]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.140]   please do so.
[02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:15.000]   There, I teach neuroscience and health-related topics
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.840]   sometimes, but not always overlapping
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:19.340]   with the content of the podcast.
[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:22.380]   We are also Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:24.580]   And last but not least,
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:26.360]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.940]   (upbeat music)
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:31.520]   (upbeat music)
