[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   What is dualism, what is idealism, what is materialism,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   what is functionalism, and what connects with you most?
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.280]   In terms of, 'cause you just mentioned,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.360]   there's a reality we don't have access to.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.640]   Okay, what does that even mean?
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.520]   And why don't we get access to it?
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.720]   Aren't we part of that reality?
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.680]   Why can't we access it?
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.160]   - So the particular trajectory that mostly exists
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.640]   in the West is the result of our indoctrination
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.480]   by a cult for 2,000 years.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.320]   - A cult, which one?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.480]   - The Catholic class mostly.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.360]   And for better or worse, it has created or defined
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.240]   many of the modes of interaction that we have
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.200]   that has created this society.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.880]   But it has also, in some sense, scarred our rationality.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.680]   And the intuition that exists, if you would translate
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.160]   the mythology of the Catholic church into the modern world
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.900]   is that the world in which you and me interact
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.680]   is something like a multiplayer role-playing adventure.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.360]   And the money and the objects that we have in this world,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.400]   this is all not real.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.400]   Or as Eastern philosophers would say, it's maya.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.800]   It's just stuff that appears to be meaningful
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.080]   and this embedding in this meaning,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.320]   if you believe in it, is samsara.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   It's basically the identification with the needs
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.300]   of the mundane, secular, everyday existence.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.920]   And the Catholics also introduced the notion
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.000]   of higher meaning, the sacred.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.520]   And this existed before, but eventually
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.440]   the natural shape of God is the platonic form
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.120]   of the civilization that you're a part of.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.920]   It's basically the superorganism that is formed
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.980]   by the individuals as an intentional agent.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.720]   And basically, the Catholics used
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.000]   a relatively crude mythology to implement software
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.480]   on the minds of people and get the software synchronized
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.920]   to make them walk in lockstep.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.760]   - To get the software synchronized.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.520]   - To basically get this God online
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.480]   and to make it efficient and effective.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   And I think God technically is just a self
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.280]   that spans multiple brains as opposed to your and myself,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   which mostly exists just on one brain.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.880]   So in some sense, you can construct a self functionally
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.320]   as a function that is implemented by brains
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.520]   that exists across brains.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.320]   And this is a God with a small g.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.200]   - That's one of the, if you look,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.280]   Yuval Harari kind of talking about,
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.480]   this is one of the nice features of our brains,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600]   it seems to, that we can all download
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.760]   the same piece of software, like God in this case,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.280]   and kind of share it.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.320]   - Yeah, so basically you give everybody a spec
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.600]   and the mathematical constraints
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.400]   that are intrinsic to information processing
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.360]   make sure that given the same spec,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.520]   you come up with a compatible structure.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.960]   - Okay, so that's, there's this space of ideas
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.080]   that we all share and we think that's kind of the mind.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.400]   But that's separate from, the idea is,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.080]   from Christianity, from religion,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.520]   is that there's a separate thing between the mind--
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.360]   - There is a real world.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.920]   And this real world is the world in which God exists.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.240]   God is the coder of the multiplayer adventure,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.160]   so to speak, and we are all players in this game.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.600]   And-- - And that's dualism.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   You would say-- - Yes.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.240]   But the dualist aspect is because the mental realm
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040]   exists in a different implementation
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.640]   than the physical realm.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.520]   And the mental realm is real.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.600]   And a lot of people have this intuition
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.800]   that there is this real room
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.440]   in which you and me talk and speak right now.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.800]   Then comes a layer of physics and abstract rules and so on.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.160]   And then comes another real room
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.000]   where our souls are and our true form
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   isn't a thing that gives us phenomenal experience.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.800]   And this, of course, is a very confused notion
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.080]   that you would get.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.120]   And it's basically, it's the result of connecting
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.120]   materialism and idealism in the wrong way.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.080]   - So, okay, I apologize, but I think it's really helpful
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.720]   if we just try to define, try to define terms.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.440]   Like, what is dualism, what is idealism,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320]   what is materialism for people that don't know?
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.360]   - So the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.880]   is that there are two substances,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.760]   a mental substance and a physical substance.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.200]   And they interact by different rules.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.320]   And the physical world is basically causally closed
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.800]   and is built on a low-level causal structure.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.600]   So there's basically a bottom level
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.480]   that is causally closed that's entirely mechanical.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.360]   And mechanical in the widest sense, so it's computational.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.800]   There's basically a physical world
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.640]   in which information flows around.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.280]   And physics describes the laws
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.880]   of how information flows around in this world.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.760]   - Would you compare it to like a computer
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   where you have hardware and software?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.240]   - The computer is a generalization
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.920]   of information flowing around.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.160]   Basically, what you will discover
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.040]   that there is a universal principle,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.600]   you can define this universal machine
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.320]   that is able to perform all the computations.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.520]   So all these machines have the same power.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.400]   This means that you can always define
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.720]   a translation between them,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.600]   as long as they have unlimited memory,
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.640]   to be able to perform each other's computations.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.120]   - So would you then say that materialism,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   this whole world is just the hardware,
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.480]   and idealism is this whole world is just the software?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.320]   - Not quite.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.400]   I think that most idealists
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.320]   don't have a notion of software yet.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   Because software also comes down to information processing.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.120]   What you notice is the only thing
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.800]   that is real to you and me is this experiential world
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.000]   in which things matter, in which things have taste,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.120]   in which things have color, phenomenal content, and so on.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.360]   - Oh, there you are bringing up consciousness, okay.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.520]   - And this is distinct from the physical world.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   In which things have values only in an abstract sense.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.240]   And you only look at cold patterns moving around.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.840]   So how does anything feel like something?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.680]   And this connection between the two things
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.480]   is very puzzling to a lot of people,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.800]   and of course, to many philosophers.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.720]   So idealism starts out with the notion
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.680]   that mind is primary,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.520]   materialism, things that matter, is primary.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.120]   And so for the idealist,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.320]   the material patterns that we see playing out
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.920]   are part of the dream that the mind is dreaming.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.440]   And we exist in a mind
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.720]   on a higher plane of existence, if you want.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.600]   And for the materialist,
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.400]   there is only this material thing,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.360]   and that generates some models,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.520]   and we are the result of these models.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.400]   And in some sense,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.560]   I don't think that we should understand,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.840]   if you understand it properly,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.120]   materialism and idealism is a dichotomy,
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.080]   but as two different aspects of the same thing.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.480]   So the weird thing is we don't exist in the physical world.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.640]   We do exist inside of a story that the brain tells itself.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.160]   - Okay, let me,
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   let my information processing take that in.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.840]   We don't exist in the physical world,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.400]   we exist in the narrative.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.560]   - Basically, a brain cannot feel anything.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.880]   A neuron cannot feel anything.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.720]   They're physical things.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.440]   Physical systems are unable to experience anything.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.360]   But it would be very useful for the brain
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.660]   or for the organism to know what it would be like
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.840]   to be a person and to feel something.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.240]   So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.520]   that it uses to model the interactions of the person.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.960]   It's the best model of what that brain,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.440]   this organism, thinks it is
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.160]   in relationship to its environment.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.280]   So it creates that model.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.820]   It's a story, a multimedia novel
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.160]   that the brain is continuously writing and updating.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.320]   - But you also kind of said that,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.160]   you said that we kind of exist in that story.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.000]   - In that story, yes.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.480]   - In that story.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.660]   What is real in any of this?
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.340]   So like, there's a, again, these terms are,
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.500]   you kind of said there's a quantum graph.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.420]   I mean, what is this whole thing running on then?
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.980]   Is the story, and is it completely, fundamentally impossible
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.260]   to get access to it?
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.140]   Because isn't the story supposed to,
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.780]   isn't the brain in something,
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.900]   in existing in some kind of context?
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.780]   - So what we can identify as computer scientists,
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.580]   we can engineer systems and test our theories this way
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.220]   that may have the necessary insufficient properties
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.620]   to produce the phenomena that we are observing,
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.540]   which is there is a self in a virtual world
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.740]   that is generated in somebody's neocortex
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.700]   that is contained in the skull of this primate here.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.860]   And when I point at this,
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.300]   this indexicality is of course wrong.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.660]   But I do create something that is likely
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.860]   to give rise to patterns on your retina
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.380]   that allow you to interpret what I'm saying, right?
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.140]   But we both know that the world that you and me are seeing
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.260]   is not the real physical world.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.760]   What we are seeing is a virtual reality generated
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.300]   in your brain to explain the patterns on your retina.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.900]   - How close is it to the real world?
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.800]   That's kind of the question.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.700]   Is it, when you have people like Donald Hoffman,
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.220]   let's say that you're really far away,
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.480]   the thing we're seeing, you and I now,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.820]   that interface we have is very far away from anything.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.940]   Like we don't even have anything close
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.860]   like to the sense of what the real world is.
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.340]   Or is it a very surface piece of architecture?
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.780]   - Imagine you look at the Mandelbrot fractal, right?
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.220]   This famous thing that Bernard Mandelbrot discovered.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.580]   If you see an overall shape in there, right?
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.340]   But you know, if you truly understand it,
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.340]   you know it's two lines of code.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.580]   It's basically a series that is being tested
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.480]   for complex numbers in the complex number plane
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.320]   for every point.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.560]   And for those where the series is diverging,
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.400]   you paint this black.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.840]   And where it's converging, you don't.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.520]   And you get the intermediate colors
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.240]   by checking how far it diverges.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.140]   - Yes.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.480]   - This gives you this shape of this fractal.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.280]   But imagine you live inside of this fractal
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.220]   and you don't have access to where you are in the fractal.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.600]   Or you have not discovered the generator function even.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.840]   Right, so what you see is,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   all I can see right now is a spiral.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.620]   And this spiral moves a little bit to the right.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.280]   Is this an accurate model of reality?
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280]   Yes, it is, right?
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.720]   It is an adequate description.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.120]   You know that there is actually no spiral
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.960]   in the Mandelbrot fractal.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.560]   It only appears like this to an observer
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.400]   that is interpreting things as a two-dimensional space
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.960]   and then defines certain irregularities in there
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.120]   at a certain scale that it currently observes.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.200]   Because if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.540]   and turn out to be something different
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.900]   at a different resolution, right?
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.740]   - Yes.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.900]   - So at this level, you have the spiral.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.820]   And then you discover the spiral moves to the right
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.260]   and at some point it disappears.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.580]   So you have a singularity.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.900]   At this point, your model is no longer valid.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.700]   You cannot predict what happens beyond the singularity.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.700]   But you can observe again and you will see
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.460]   it hit another spiral and at this point it disappeared.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.500]   So we now have a second-order law.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.660]   And if you make 30 layers of these laws,
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.460]   then you have a description of the world
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.420]   that is similar to the one that we come up with
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.100]   when we describe the reality around us.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.640]   It's reasonably predictive.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.720]   It does not cut to the core of it.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.680]   It does not explain how it's being generated,
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.000]   how it actually works.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.720]   But it's relatively good to explain the universe
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.560]   that we are entangled with.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.360]   - But you don't think the tools of computer science
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.080]   or the tools of physics could step outside,
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.060]   see the whole drawing, and get at the basic mechanism
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.520]   of how the pattern, the spirals, is generated?
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.200]   - Imagine you would find yourself
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.560]   embedded into a motherboard fracture
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.880]   and you try to figure out what works
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.200]   and you somehow have a Turing machine
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.300]   with enough memory to think.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.620]   And as a result, you come to this idea,
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.540]   it must be some kind of automaton.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.900]   And maybe you just enumerate all the possible automata
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.660]   until you get to the one that produces your reality.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.620]   So you can identify necessary and sufficient condition.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.020]   For instance, we discover that mathematics itself
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.340]   is the domain of all languages.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.980]   And then we see that most of the domains of mathematics
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.420]   that we have discovered are, in some sense,
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.700]   describing the same fractals.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.860]   This is what category theory is obsessed about,
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.280]   that you can map these different domains to each other.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.140]   So there are not that many fractals.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.560]   And some of these have interesting structure
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.000]   and symmetry breaks.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.840]   And so you can discover what region of this global fractal
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.400]   you might be embedded in from first principles.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.720]   But the only way you can get there is from first principles.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.200]   So basically, your understanding of the universe
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.480]   has to start with automata and then number theory
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.240]   and then spaces and so on.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.640]   - Yeah, I think, like Stephen Wolfram still dreams
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.660]   that he'll be able to arrive at the fundamental rules
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.120]   of the cellular automata or the generalization
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.260]   of which is behind our universe.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.340]   You've said on this topic,
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.620]   you said in a recent conversation that, quote,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.820]   "Some people think that a simulation can't be conscious
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.860]   "and only a physical system can,
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.300]   "but they got it completely backward.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.080]   "A physical system cannot be conscious.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   "Only a simulation can be conscious.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.040]   "Consciousness is a simulated property
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.380]   "that simulates itself."
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.900]   Just like you said, the mind is kind of,
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.580]   we'll call it story, narrative.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.740]   There's a simulation.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.260]   So our mind is essentially a simulation?
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.580]   - Usually, I try to use the terminology
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.920]   so that the mind is basically the principles
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.100]   that produce the simulation.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.100]   It's the software that is implemented by your brain.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.820]   And the mind is creating both the universe that we are in
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.680]   and the self, the idea of a person
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.420]   that is on the other side of attention
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.420]   and is embedded in this world.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.420]   - Why is that important, that idea of a self?
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.660]   Why is that an important feature in the simulation?
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.520]   - It's basically a result of the purpose
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.740]   that the mind has.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.260]   It's a tool for modeling, right?
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.340]   We are not actually monkeys.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.000]   We are side effects of the regulation needs of monkeys.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.820]   And what the monkey has to regulate
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.100]   is the relationship of an organism to an outside world
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.340]   that is in large part also consisting of other organisms.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.340]   And as a result, it basically has regulation targets
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.740]   that it tries to get to.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.700]   These regulation targets start with priors.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.980]   They're basically like unconditional reflexes
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.460]   that we are more or less born with.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.220]   And then we can reverse engineer them
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.860]   to make them more consistent.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.260]   And then we get more detailed models
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.140]   about how the world works and how to interact with it.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.380]   And so these priors that you commit to
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.360]   are largely target values
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.180]   that our needs should approach, set points.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.780]   And this deviation to the set point
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.580]   creates some urge, some tension.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.540]   And we find ourselves living inside of feedback loops,
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.380]   right?
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.820]   Consciousness emerges over dimensions
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.880]   of disagreements with the universe.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.660]   Things that you care,
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.420]   things are not the way they should be,
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.660]   but you need to regulate.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.840]   And so in some sense, the sense itself
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.740]   is the result of all the identifications
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.580]   that you're having.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.780]   An identification is a regulation target
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.900]   that you're committing to.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.700]   It's a dimension that you care about,
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.300]   that you think is important.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.660]   And this is also what locks you in.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.460]   If you let go of these commitments,
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.140]   of these identifications, you get free.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.500]   There's nothing that you have to do anymore.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.740]   And if you let go of all of them,
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.660]   you're completely free and you can enter Nirvana
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.660]   because you're done.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.180]   - And actually, this is a good time to pause and say
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.820]   thank you to a friend of mine, Gustav Sordestrom,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.260]   who introduced me to your work.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.780]   I want to give him a shout out.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.540]   He's a brilliant guy.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.540]   And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.500]   And Gustav is a good representative of that.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.340]   You are as well.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.020]   So I'm glad, first of all,
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.780]   I'm glad the internet exists and YouTube exists
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.500]   where I can watch your talks
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   and then get to your book and study your writing
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.940]   and think about, you know, that's amazing.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.100]   Okay, but you've kind of described
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.660]   in sort of this emergent phenomenon of consciousness
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.800]   from the simulation.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.420]   So what about the hard problem of consciousness?
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.780]   Can you just linger on it?
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.060]   Why does it still feel?
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.860]   Like, I understand you're kind of,
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.340]   the self is an important part of the simulation,
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.300]   but why does the simulation feel like something?
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.500]   - So if you look at a book by, say, George R.R. Martin
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.980]   where the characters have plausible psychology
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.540]   and they stand on a hill
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.460]   because they want to conquer the city below the hill
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.300]   and they're done in it
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.660]   and they look at the color of the sky
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.900]   and they are apprehensive and feel empowered
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.740]   and all these things.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.660]   Why do they have these emotions?
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.940]   It's because it's written into the story, right?
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.860]   And it's written into the story
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.900]   because it's an adequate model of the person
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.660]   that predicts what they're going to do next.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.740]   And the same thing is true for us.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.060]   So it's basically a story that our brain is writing.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.220]   It's not written in words.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.300]   It's written in perceptual content,
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.180]   basically multimedia content.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.060]   And it's a model of what the person would feel
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.900]   if it existed.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.860]   So it's a virtual person.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.100]   And you and me happen to be this virtual person.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.340]   So this virtual person gets access to the language center
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.740]   and talks about the sky being blue.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.140]   And this is us.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.100]   - But hold on a second.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.020]   Do I exist in your simulation?
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.740]   - You do exist in an almost similar way as me.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.740]   So there are internal states that are less accessible
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.580]   for me that you have and so on.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.060]   And my model might not be completely adequate.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.820]   There are also things that I might perceive about you
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.280]   that you don't perceive.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.140]   But in some sense, both you and me are some puppets,
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.540]   two puppets that enact this play in my mind.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.460]   And I identify with one of them
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.260]   because I can control one of the puppet directly.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.980]   And with the other one, I can create things in between.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.900]   So for instance, we can go in an interaction
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.420]   that even leads to a coupling to a feedback loop.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.100]   So we can sync things together in a certain way
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.460]   or feel things together.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.260]   But this coupling is itself not a physical phenomenon.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.100]   It's entirely a software phenomenon.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.180]   It's the result of two different implementations
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.300]   interacting with each other.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.260]   - So that's interesting.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.220]   So are you suggesting,
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.860]   like the way you think about it,
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.000]   is the entirety of existence, the simulation,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.060]   and we're kind of each mind is a little sub-simulation
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.900]   that like, why don't you,
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.820]   why doesn't your mind have access
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.940]   to my mind's full state?
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.060]   Like--
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.540]   - For the same reason that my mind
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.100]   doesn't have access to its own full state.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.020]   - So what, I mean--
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.540]   - There is no trick involved.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.700]   So basically when I know something about myself,
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.260]   it's because I made a model.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.340]   So one part of your brain is tasked with modeling
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.420]   what other parts of your brain are doing.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.900]   - Yes, but there seems to be an incredible consistency
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.460]   about this world in the physical sense,
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.900]   that there's repeatable experiments and so on.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.980]   How does that fit into our silly
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.780]   descendant of apes simulation of the world?
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.820]   So why is it so repeatable?
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.460]   Why is everything so repeatable?
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.760]   And not everything.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.540]   There's a lot of fundamental physics experiments
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.780]   that are repeatable for a long time,
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.340]   all over the place, and so on.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.380]   The laws of physics, how does that fit in?
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.220]   - It seems that the parts of the world
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.660]   that are not deterministic are not long lived.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.900]   So if you build a system, any kind of automaton,
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.380]   so if you build simulations of something,
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.720]   you'll notice that the phenomena that endure
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.880]   are those that give rise to stable dynamics.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.980]   So basically if you see anything that is complex
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.900]   in the world, it's the result of usually of some control,
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.780]   of some feedback that keeps it stable
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.260]   around certain attractors.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.740]   And the things that are not stable,
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.080]   that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.300]   and so on, they tend to get weeded out over time.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.740]   So if we are in a region of the universe
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.280]   that sustains complexity, which is required
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.100]   to implement minds like ours,
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.940]   this is going to be a region of the universe
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.800]   that is very tightly controlled and controllable.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.580]   So it's going to have lots of interesting symmetries
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.980]   and also symmetry breaks that allow
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.740]   to the creation of structure.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.300]   - But they exist where?
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.220]   So there's such an interesting idea
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.000]   that our mind is simulation that's constructing
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.300]   the narrative.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.700]   My question is, just to try to understand
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.620]   how that fits with the entirety of the universe.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.260]   You're saying that there's a region of this universe
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.980]   that allows enough complexity to create creatures like us,
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.480]   but what's the connection between the brain,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.300]   the mind, and the broader universe?
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.220]   Which comes first?
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.700]   Which is more fundamental?
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.300]   Is the mind the starting point, the universe is emergent?
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.980]   Is the universe the starting point, the minds are emergent?
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.940]   - I think quite clearly the latter.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.940]   That's at least a much easier explanation
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.220]   because it allows us to make causal models.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.780]   And I don't see any way to construct an inverse causality.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.780]   - So what happens when you die to your mind simulation?
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.540]   - My implementation ceases.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.320]   So basically the thing that implements myself
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.880]   will no longer be present.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.320]   Which means if I'm not implemented
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.420]   on the minds of other people,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.120]   the thing that I identify with.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.620]   The weird thing is I don't actually have an identity
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.740]   beyond the identity that I construct.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.680]   If I was the Dalai Lama,
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.360]   he identifies as a form of government.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.560]   So basically the Dalai Lama gets reborn,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.440]   not because he's confused,
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.020]   but because he is not identifying as a human being.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.280]   He runs on a human being.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.760]   He's basically a governmental software
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.840]   that is instantiated in every new generation and you.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.540]   So his advisors will pick someone
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.340]   who does this in the next generation.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.320]   So if you identify with this,
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.640]   you are no longer a human and you don't die in the sense,
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.200]   what dies is only the body of the human that you run on.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.280]   To kill the Dalai Lama, you would have to kill his tradition.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.400]   And if we look at ourselves,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.760]   we realize that we are to a small part like this,
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.600]   most of us.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.520]   So for instance, if you have children,
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.400]   you realize something lives on in them.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.040]   Or if you spark an idea in the world, something lives on.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.860]   Or if you identify with the society around you,
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.440]   because you are a part that.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.960]   You're not just this human being.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.240]   - Yeah, so in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.160]   in the sense that you, Josh Abach,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.760]   is just a collection of ideas.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.200]   So you have this operating system
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.560]   on which a bunch of ideas live and interact.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560]   And then once you die,
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.080]   they kind of, some of them jump off the ship.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.520]   - Put it the other way, identity is a software state.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.720]   It's a construction.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.000]   It's not physically real.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.340]   Identity is not a physical concept.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.720]   It's basically a representation of different objects
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.480]   on the same world line.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.840]   - But identity lives and dies.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.680]   Are you attached?
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.120]   What's the fundamental thing?
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.880]   Is it the ideas that come together to form identity?
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.280]   Or is each individual identity
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.760]   actually a fundamental thing?
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.120]   - It's a representation that you can get agency over
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:05.960]   if you care.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.360]   Basically, you can choose what you identify with
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.520]   if you want to.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.520]   - No, but it just seems, if the mind is not real,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:21.120]   that the birth and death is not a crucial part of it.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.400]   Well, maybe I'm silly.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.720]   Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.320]   But it seems that the physical,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.280]   being a physical object in this world
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.240]   is an important aspect of birth and death.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.880]   Like it feels like it has to be physical to die.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.400]   It feels like simulations don't have to die.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.960]   - The physics that we experience is not the real physics.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.600]   There is no color and sound in the real world.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.000]   Color and sound are types of representations
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.720]   that you get if you want to model reality
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.680]   with oscillators, right?
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.480]   So colors and sound in some sense have octaves.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.320]   - Yes.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.240]   - And it's because they are represented
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.680]   probably with oscillators, right?
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.000]   So that's why colors form a circle of use.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.520]   And colors have harmonics, sounds have harmonics
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.280]   as a result of synchronizing oscillators in the brain, right?
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.840]   So the world that we subjectively interact with
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.120]   is fundamentally the result
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.560]   of the representation mechanisms in our brain.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.600]   They are mathematically, to some degree, universal.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.000]   There are certain regularities that you can discover
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.680]   in the patterns and not others.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.320]   But the patterns that we get, this is not the real world.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.480]   The world that we interact with
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.040]   is always made of too many parts to count, right?
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.720]   So when you look at this table and so on,
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.000]   it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.920]   that you cannot count them.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.160]   So you only look at the aggregate dynamics,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.720]   at limit dynamics.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.560]   If you had almost infinitely many particles,
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.200]   what would be the dynamics of the table?
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.400]   And this is roughly what you get.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.800]   So geometry that we are interacting with
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.920]   is the result of discovering those operators
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.760]   that work in the limit,
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.120]   that you get by building an infinite series that converges.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.640]   For those parts where it converges, it's geometry.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.280]   For those parts where it doesn't converge, it's chaos.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.320]   - Right, and then, so all of that is filtered
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   through the consciousness that's emergent in our narrative.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.760]   So the consciousness gives it color,
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.960]   gives it feeling, gives it flavor.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.480]   - So I think the feeling, flavor, and so on,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.640]   is given by the relationship that a feature has
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.240]   to all the other features.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.280]   It's basically a giant relational graph
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.460]   that is our subjective universe.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.840]   The color is given by those aspects of the representation,
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.080]   or this experiential color where you care about,
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.680]   where you have identifications,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.040]   where something means something,
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.760]   where you are the inside of a feedback loop,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.160]   and the dimensions of caring are basically dimensions
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.800]   of this motivational system that we emerge over.
