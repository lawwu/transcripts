[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300]   ♪
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.300]   Bonsir, the chariot builder of Babylon, was thoroughly discouraged.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.300]   From his seat upon the low wall surrounding his property, he gazed sadly at his simple home
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.300]   and the open workshop in which stood a partially completed chariot.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300]   His wife frequently appeared at the open door.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.300]   Her furtive glances in his direction reminded him that the meal bag was almost empty
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.300]   and he should be at work finishing the chariot, hammering and hewing, polishing and painting,
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.300]   stretching taut the leather over the wheel rims, preparing it for delivery
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.300]   so he could collect from his wealthy customer.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.300]   Nevertheless, his fat, muscular body sat stolidly upon the wall.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.300]   His slow mind was struggling patiently with a problem for which he could find no answer.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:30.300]   The hot, tropical sun, so typical of this valley of the Euphrates, beat down upon him mercilessly.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.300]   Beads of perspiration formed upon his brow and trickled down unnoticed
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.300]   to lose themselves in the hairy jungle on his chest.
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.300]   Beyond his home towered the high terraced walls surrounding the king's palace.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.300]   Nearby, cleaving the blue heavens, was the painted tower of the temple of Bel.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.300]   In the shadow of such grandeur was his simple home and many others far less neat and well cared for.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   Babylon was like this, a mixture of grandeur and squalor,
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.300]   of dazzling wealth and direst poverty,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.300]   crowded together without plan or system within the protecting walls of the city.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300]   Behind him, had he cared to turn and look,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.300]   the noisy chariots of the rich jostled and crowded aside the sandaled tradesmen
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   as well as the barefooted beggars.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.300]   Even the rich were forced to turn into the gutters to clear the way
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   for the long lines of slave water carriers on the "king's business,"
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.300]   each burying a heavy goatskin of water to be poured upon the hanging gardens.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   Bonsir was too engrossed in his own problem to hear or heed the confused hubbub of the busy city.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   It was the unexpected twanging of the strings from a familiar lyre that aroused him from his reverie.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   He turned and looked into the sensitive, smiling face of his best friend, Cobi the musician.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   "May the gods bless thee with great liberality, my good friend," began Cobi with an elaborate salute.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   "Yet it does appear they have already been so generous thou needest not to labor.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   I rejoice with thee in thy good fortune. More I would even share it with thee.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.300]   Pray from thy purse, which must be bulging, else thou wouldst be busy and yawn shop,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.300]   extract but two humble shekels, and lend them to me until after the nobleman's feast this night.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.300]   Thou wilt not miss them, ere they are returned."
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.300]   "If I did have two shekels," Bonsir responded gloomily, "to no one could I lend them,
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.300]   not even to you, my best of friends, for they would be my fortune, my entire fortune.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.300]   No one lends his entire fortune, not even to his best friend."
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.300]   "What!" exclaimed Cobi with genuine surprise. "Thou hast not one shekel in thy purse,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.300]   yet sit like a statue upon a wall? Why not complete that chariot?
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.300]   How else canst thou provide for thy noble appetite? 'Tis not like thee, my friend.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   Where is thy endless energy? Doth something distress thee? Have the gods brought to thee troubles?"
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   "A torment from the gods it must be," Bonsir agreed. "It began with a dream, a senseless dream,
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:25.300]   in which I thought I was a man of means. From my belt hung a handsome purse, heavy with coins.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   There were shekels which I cast with careless freedom to the beggars. There were pieces of silver,
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.300]   with which I did buy finery for my wife, and whatever I did desire for myself.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.300]   There were pieces of gold which made me feel assured of the future and unafraid to spend the silver.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   A glorious feeling of contentment was within me. You would not have known me for thy hard-working friend,
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.300]   nor wouldst have known my wife, so free from wrinkles was her face and shining with happiness.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.300]   She was again the smiling maiden of our early married days."
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.300]   "A pleasant dream indeed," commented Cobby. "But why should such pleasant feelings, as it aroused,
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.300]   turn thee into a glum statue upon the wall?"
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.300]   "Why, indeed, because when I awoke and remembered how empty was my purse, a feeling of rebellion swept over me.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.300]   Let us talk it over together, for, as the sailors do say, we ride in the same boat, we two.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   As youngsters we went together to the priests to learn wisdom. As young men we shared each other's pleasures.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.300]   As grown men we have always been close friends. We have been contented subjects of our kind.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.300]   We have been satisfied to work long hours and spend our earnings freely.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.300]   We have earned much coin in the years that have passed.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.300]   Yet, to know the joys that come from wealth, we must dream about them.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.300]   Bah! Are we more than dumb sheep? We live in the richest city in all the world.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:03.300]   The travelers do say none equals it in wealth. About us is much display of wealth, but of it we ourselves have not."
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.300]   "After half a lifetime of hard labor, thou, my best of friends, hast an empty purse, and sayest to me,
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   'May I borrow such a trifle as two shekels until after the nobleman's feast this night?'
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   Then what do I reply? Do I say, 'Here is my purse, its contents will I gladly share?'
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   No, I admit that my purse is as empty as thine. What is the matter?
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   Why cannot we acquire silver and gold, more than enough for food and robes?
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.300]   Consider also our sons,'" Bonsire continued, "are they not following in the footsteps of their fathers?
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.300]   Need they and their families and their sons and their sons' families live all their lives in the midst of such treasurers of gold,
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.300]   and yet, like us, be content to banquet upon sour goat's milk and porridge?"
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.300]   "Never in all the years of our friendship didst thou talk like this before, Bonsire."
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   Cobi was puzzled. "Never in all those years did I think like this before.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.300]   From early dawn until darkness stopped me, I have labored to build the finest chariots any man could make.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:14.300]   Soft-heartedly hoping someday the gods would recognize my worthy deeds and bestow upon me great prosperity.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.300]   This they have never done. At last I realize this they will never do.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.300]   Therefore my heart is sad. I wish to be a man of means.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.300]   I wish to own lands and cattle, to have fine robes and coins in my purse.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   I am willing to work for these things with all the strength in my back,
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.300]   with all the skill in my hands, with all the cunning in my mind,
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.300]   but I wish my labors to be fairly rewarded.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.300]   What is the matter with us?
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   Again I ask you, why cannot we have our just share of the good things so plentiful
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   for those who have the gold with which to buy them?"
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:01.300]   "Would I know an answer," Cobi replied. "No better than thou am I satisfied.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:08.300]   My earnings from my lyre are quickly gone. Often must I plan and scheme that my family be not hungry.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:14.300]   Also within my breast is a deep longing for a lyre large enough that it may truly sing the strains of music
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:22.300]   that do surge through my mind. With such an instrument could I make music finer than even the king has heard before.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.300]   Such a lyre thou shouldst have. No man in all Babylon could make it sing more sweetly,
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:34.300]   could make it sing so sweetly, not only the king but the gods themselves would be delighted.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.300]   But how mayest thou secure it while we both of us are as poor as the king's slaves?
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.300]   Listen to the bell, here they come!"
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   He pointed to the long column of half-naked, sweating water-bearers
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   plodding laboriously up the narrow street from the river.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.300]   Five abreast they marched, each bent under a heavy goatskin of water.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   "A fine figure of a man, he who doth lead them," Cobi indicated the wearer of the bell,
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   "who marched in front without a load. A prominent man in his own country 'tis easy to see."
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   "There are many good figures in the line," Bonsire agreed, "as good men as we.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   Tall, blond men from the north, laughing black men from the south,
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   little brown men from the nearer countries, all marching together from the river to the gardens,
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:28.300]   back and forth, day after day, year after year.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.300]   Nought of happiness to look forward to, beds of straw upon which to sleep,
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   hard-grained porridge to eat. Pity the poor brutes, Cobi!"
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.300]   "Pity them I do, yet thou dost make me see how little better off are we,
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.300]   free men though we call ourselves."
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.300]   "That is truth, Cobi, unpleasant thought though it be.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.300]   We do not wish to go on year after year living slavish lives,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   working, working, working, getting nowhere."
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   "Might we not find out how others acquire gold and do as they do?" Cobi inquired.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   "Perhaps there is some secret we might learn if we but sought from those who knew,"
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   replied Bonsire thoughtfully.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:18.300]   "This very day," suggested Cobi, "I did pass our old friend Arkad riding in his golden chariot.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.300]   This I will say, he did not look over my humble head as many in his station might consider his right.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   Instead he did wave his hand that all onlookers might see him pay greetings
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.300]   and bestow his smile of friendship upon Cobi the musician."
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.300]   "He is claimed to be the richest man in all Babylon," Bonsire mused.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.300]   "So rich the king is said to seek his golden aid in affairs of the treasury," Cobi replied.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.300]   "So rich," Bonsire interrupted, "I fear if I should meet him in the darkness of the night,
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.300]   I should lay my hands upon his fat wallet."
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.300]   "Nonsense," reproved Cobi. "A man's wealth is not in the purse he carries.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   A fat purse quickly empties if there be no golden stream to refill it.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.300]   Arkad has an income that constantly keeps his purse full, no matter how liberally he spends."
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:16.300]   "Income, that is the thing," ejaculated Bonsire. "I wish an income that will keep flowing into my purse,
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:23.300]   whether I sit upon the wall or travel to far lands. Arkad must know how a man can make an income for himself.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.300]   Dost suppose it is something he could make clear to a mind as slow as mine?"
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.300]   "Methinks he did teach his knowledge to his son, Nomasir," Cobi responded.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.300]   "Did he not go to Nineveh? And so it is told that the inn become, without aid from his father,
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.300]   one of the richest men in that city?"
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:48.300]   "Cobi, thou bringest to me a rare thought," a new light gleamed in Bonsire's eyes.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:54.300]   "It costs nothing to ask wise advice from a good friend, and Arkad was always that.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   Never mind though our purses be as empty as the falcon's nest of a year ago, let that not detain us.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:07.300]   We are weary of being without gold in the midst of plenty. We wish to become men of means.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:13.300]   Come, let us go to Arkad and ask how we also may acquire incomes for ourselves."
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   "Thou speakest with true inspiration, Bonsire. Thou bringest to my mind a new understanding.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   Thou makest me to realize the reason why we have never found any measure of wealth.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.300]   We have never sought it.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.300]   Thou hast labored patiently to build the staunchest chariots in Babylon.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   To that purpose was devoted your best endeavors. Therefore, at it, thou didst succeed.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   I strove to become a skillful lyre-player, and at it I did succeed.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.300]   In those things toward which we exerted our best endeavors, we succeeded.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   The gods were content to let us continue thus.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.300]   Now at last we see a light, bright like that from the rising sun.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.300]   It biddeth us to learn more that we may prosper more.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   With a new understanding we shall find honorable ways to accomplish our desires."
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.300]   "Let us go to Arkad this very day," Bonsire urged.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.300]   "Also, let us ask other friends of our boyhood days,
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:18.300]   who have fared no better than ourselves, to join us, that they too may share in his wisdom."
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.300]   "Thou wert ever thus thoughtful of thy friends, Bonsire.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.300]   Therefore hast thou many friends. It shall be as thou sayest.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.300]   We go this day and take them with us."
