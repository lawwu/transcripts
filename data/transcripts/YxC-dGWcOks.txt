[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Imagine retiring early and living comfortably for decades
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.300]   without running out of money.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.560]   Sounds like a dream, right?
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560]   Well, today we're gonna demystify the secrets
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.640]   of smart retirement planning that go far beyond
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.400]   the commonly touted 4% rule.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.440]   Whether you're aiming for early retirement
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.200]   or just wanna secure a worry-free future,
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.020]   these strategies will help you navigate the complexities
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.440]   of safe withdrawal rates and market risks.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.980]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today I'm joined by Karsten
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.540]   from Early Retirement Now.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.400]   And big favor before we jump in
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.780]   is to give us a quick thumbs up
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.460]   to help others find this channel.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.620]   And if you're new here and you wanna keep upgrading
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.380]   your life, money, and travel, consider subscribing.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.140]   You say that people can't afford not to retire early.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.220]   Is that message really for everyone?
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.800]   Hopefully not for everybody, right?
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.880]   You want some really productive people
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.560]   to keep working forever, right?
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.680]   You want the Warren Buffetts and I mean, Charlie Munger,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.940]   I think he was over 90 and still working when he passed away.
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.280]   So we need those people too.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.520]   So, but for, yeah, for most folks,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.200]   I think early retirement is a great concept
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.860]   and it is attainable and achievable.
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.780]   And so that's why that's by my little byline there
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.580]   on my blog that you should recognize
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.040]   that you have this opportunity cost
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.200]   like going to the office every day,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.920]   you miss so much in terms of family time.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.480]   And at some point you accumulate enough assets,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.000]   then the opportunity cost goes the other way around
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.460]   from what we normally learn it in economics, right?
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.080]   Opportunity cost means you want to do fun stuff.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.040]   You have the missed opportunity cost of your salary.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.120]   If you have a lot of money,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.300]   I think it's the other way around.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.760]   Keep going to work and getting more promotions
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.380]   and bigger gadgets, bigger houses, bigger cars.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.600]   At some point, the opportunity cost
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.640]   goes the other way around, right?
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.360]   You miss out on life.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.940]   But that's where this idea comes from.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.520]   You can't afford not to retire early.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.360]   At some point, you should consider this opportunity cost
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.060]   and spend more time with loved ones,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.780]   travel more, have more relaxed time.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.360]   - A lot of the criticisms
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.940]   of the financial independence movement
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.560]   have kind of said, you know, that's great,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.280]   but only if you have a high salary
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.980]   and only if you can do all these things.
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.640]   So do you think it's really attainable
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.940]   for the average employee in a company?
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.480]   - Obviously, if you look at what would be the ideal setting
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   for somebody to achieve FIRE, right,
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.700]   it would be a married couple, no kids,
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.280]   very high salaries, professional salaries,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.400]   say doctors, lawyers, engineers,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.480]   finance professionals, accountants,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.440]   live in a low-cost area and have no student loan debt.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.740]   So that would be the ideal setting.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.740]   I think those people should probably make it very easily.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.860]   And somebody who would have a very challenging time
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.080]   would be single, income family, lots of kids,
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.040]   high cost of living area.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.400]   So they would find it more challenging.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.040]   But nobody's always at the extremes, right?
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.080]   So for example, my personal example is,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.940]   yeah, I was in a very high-paying industry
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.240]   and a very high-paying job in finance.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.400]   I had little to no student loan debt, so that was good.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.660]   But we had a single family,
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.860]   so we had a single-income family,
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.700]   so my wife didn't work once we had our daughter,
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.740]   and we lived in a high-cost of living area.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.480]   So we checked off some of the boxes
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.280]   and we didn't check off some of the other boxes.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.400]   I think even if you are somewhere in between,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.060]   between the ideal and the not-so-ideal extreme,
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.020]   you can still make it.
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.360]   I mean, I did it, and there are lots of people
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.280]   who achieved FIRE and FIRE
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.900]   without ever earning six figures.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.900]   And I mean, if they can make it,
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.400]   it's a lot more attainable.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.560]   And I think, yeah, I understand there are some challenges,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.980]   but I think also a lot of the criticism of FIRE and FIRE
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.940]   is it's a little bit of coping, right?
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.240]   It's easier to make excuses
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.020]   than to get your act together and do it, right?
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.700]   Because that's going to be a long path, right?
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.560]   It's going to be a 10 to 15-year path to get your finances
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.860]   in order and accumulate enough.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.120]   And it's very easy to just fall back and say,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.320]   "Well, only the very rich people can do it,"
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.580]   and I throw up my hands and I'm not going to do it, so.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.940]   - I'm not going to walk through the process for that.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.240]   I've done an episode on financial independence.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.620]   We'll put it in the show notes.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.700]   But when you talk to most people
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.060]   about how to think about this,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.020]   the most common rule or rule of thumb is the 4% rule,
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.580]   which is like, how do you know if you can do this?
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.860]   And it's that, oh, well, if you have enough assets
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.220]   that you can live off 4%, you're all set.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.580]   What do you think people get wrong
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.620]   if they rely on something so simple?
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.620]   - So I think a 4% rule is a good guideline.
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.500]   If you are starting out and say you have zero assets
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.060]   and you're starting on this path
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.560]   and you think maybe 10, 15, 20 years down the road,
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.540]   you are going to need, say, $80,000 a year
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.180]   to live comfortably, yeah,
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.020]   and then you can say it's times 25,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.820]   which is the equivalent of the 4% rule, right?
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.180]   One divided by 25 is 0.04, is 4%.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.820]   That's where that comes from.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.020]   So this rule of 25X, so if you have $2 million,
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.020]   you should be able to roughly retire at that time.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.980]   It's obviously just the rule of thumb, right?
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.860]   So this should not be generalized, right?
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.260]   We should not all wear the same shoe size
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.940]   and it's gonna be too tight for some
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.260]   and too big for others.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.260]   And the reason why this 4% rule has gotten such fame
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.260]   is obviously it's a round number, right?
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.300]   And the actual results,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.140]   if you look at some of the extreme cases
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.460]   that you could have, say somebody who is really young,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.780]   who has a much longer horizon,
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.020]   yeah, you probably have to go down
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.180]   to something like 3%, right?
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.580]   And somebody who is really close to social security, right,
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.260]   who maybe only has to bridge a little bit of time
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.420]   until they have some other cash flows coming in,
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.580]   you could maybe go to 5%, right?
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.100]   So then people say, well, you know,
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.820]   this big range of 3% to 5%, 4% is right in the middle.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.220]   It's a nice round number.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.300]   And then the 3% and the 5%,
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.820]   hey, it's just a percent difference, right?
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.340]   What is it really?
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.380]   So 4% seems to be this nice, precise, and round number.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.580]   Of course, the problem with that
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.580]   is the range from 3% to 5% is not a 2% difference, right?
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.060]   To go from, say, a $60,000 a year budget
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.980]   to $100,000 a year budget,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.820]   say on a $2 million nest egg,
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.260]   that's not a 2% difference, right?
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.860]   To go from 60% to 100%, that's a 66% difference.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.580]   So this is a really wide range, right?
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.300]   So if somebody says, yeah, it's 4%,
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.260]   but it could be anywhere between 3% and 5%,
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.580]   that's like saying the weather forecast,
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.980]   it could be anywhere between freezing
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.460]   and heatwave tomorrow, and that's obviously true,
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.940]   but it's really a useless forecast
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.140]   in terms of doing actually something concrete.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.020]   So my point is that the 4% rule,
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.820]   my problem is not so much with the 4% number,
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.580]   but it's about the word rule, right?
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.140]   It shouldn't be a rule, it's a rule of thumb.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.340]   Your actual number should be more custom-fitted,
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.660]   and it should be custom-fitted,
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.860]   taking into account your personal parameters, your age,
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.060]   whether you would like to leave a bequest,
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.620]   whether you would like to make major contributions.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.820]   Say, if you have kids,
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.700]   do you want to help them with down payment
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.500]   in college later in life?
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.900]   Do you want them to also start from scratch,
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.420]   or do you want to help them a little bit, right?
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.500]   Whether you have supplemental cash flows
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.700]   later in retirement,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.100]   whether you, when and how much social security you expect,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.700]   do you have any kind of government pension,
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.020]   military pension, corporate pension that kicks in later?
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.660]   So all of that could make really huge differences
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.780]   in your calculations, right?
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.020]   And so this is why you get this wide window.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.780]   I have done safe withdrawal case studies for people,
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:39.020]   and they can range anywhere from somewhere in the 3% range
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.380]   to all the way to 6-plus percent,
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.860]   and that is such a wide range,
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.780]   tells you that you should take
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.660]   your personal parameters in account.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.180]   And the other thing you have to take into account
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.980]   is also where are asset markets today, right?
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.980]   If you're retiring at the bottom of a recession
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.740]   and a bear market,
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.900]   you can probably be a little bit more aggressive
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.660]   because, well, if the market is already down 30%, 40%,
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.060]   the probability that we tag on another Great Depression
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.540]   or global financial crisis
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.940]   on top of what we already dropped is very unlikely.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.820]   So you can probably factor in that
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.260]   you don't need to go by the historical worst-case scenarios,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.860]   which would normally traditionally get you to that 4%.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.300]   Well, then, yes, absolutely, you can also do a 6% rule
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.340]   or even more than 6%.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.660]   So depending on where you are in the market cycle,
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.340]   you should also adjust that.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.340]   And so just taking one number and running with that,
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.060]   that seems really inappropriate,
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.220]   and that's really my little niche on my blog
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.700]   where I look into what can we learn
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.700]   and what can we put into our safe withdrawal analysis
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.500]   that factors in some of these idiosyncratic
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.580]   personal parameters,
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.500]   and then also looking at what the market tells us,
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.700]   how much we can withdraw at any point.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.620]   - So we'll link to the whole series
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.220]   because I don't actually know if you know
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.380]   how many words it is, but 60-plus posts,
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.340]   you know, it's basically a book at this point,
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.340]   if not multiple. - Right, right, right.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.740]   - We won't cover it all,
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.940]   but I wanna double-click a little bit.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.060]   It sounds like what I heard you say might be one,
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.100]   3%, if anything, is probably a really safe number,
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.900]   but very conservative for lots of people.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.540]   When you start to try to dial in what this is,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.420]   how much does longevity matter?
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.420]   Was the 4% rule designed to last for 100 years,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.500]   or is it much more timeframe-sensitive?
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.100]   - So the 4% rule, the original papers,
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.740]   they had a 30-year retirement horizon,
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.100]   and then what people did was,
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.140]   well, so the initial 4% rule,
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.700]   a success would have been if you run out of money
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.900]   after exactly 30 years,
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.420]   or you're running on fumes towards the end,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.940]   and you have basically one cent left after 30 years,
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.180]   that would have been called a success, right?
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.580]   So we can already see what kind of problems that creates
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.820]   if we extrapolate and make this a longer horizon.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.260]   So if we take longer horizons,
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.820]   we probably have to withdraw a little bit less.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.700]   Now, some people who are not very good at math,
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.820]   they would say, well, if you have a 60-year horizon,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.460]   does that mean you cannot do only 2%?
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.820]   And fortunately, that's not the case, right?
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.180]   You can do much, much more than 2%.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.500]   So it's probably somewhere in the range.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.580]   You go from 4% to maybe 3.25%, right?
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.580]   So basically, the just very basic safe withdrawal analysis
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.700]   is something that I could take a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.020]   a 75/25 portfolio,
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.420]   and look at how you would have fared
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.140]   during the Great Depression.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.820]   Yeah, the good news is it would have lasted for 60 years
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.860]   if you go down into the maybe the low 3%.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.740]   It's much better than 4% divided by two,
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.540]   but it is definitely much less.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.260]   And I thought, and this was actually one of the reasons
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.620]   that enticed me to write my series.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.340]   I saw that there was a lot of misinformation out there
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.500]   in the FIRE community where people said,
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.900]   oh yeah, I mean, most of the time you last for 30 years,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.900]   and most of the historical cohorts
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.500]   actually ended up with more money than they started with.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.460]   And well, if you still have the same amount of money
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.980]   after 30 years, you just tag on another 30 years,
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.300]   and boom, 4% rule can be extrapolated indefinitely.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.260]   But yeah, I mean, the problem is that,
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.140]   I mean, this is obviously something
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.980]   of an amortization exercise, right?
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.780]   And if you expand the horizon,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.900]   then obviously something happens to the payment, right?
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.180]   The question is, is there really a big impact
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.340]   or a small impact?
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.900]   And it's obviously much more optimistic
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.820]   than just having to half your payout
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.220]   if you double the horizon, but it is a noticeable impact
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.300]   if you go from 30 years to 40 years to 50 years to 60 years.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.260]   And again, it may not quite show up
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.260]   in terms of the percentage of that going from 4% to 3.2%.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.180]   And again, this is not a 0.8% decrease in your budget,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.540]   it's a 20% decrease in your budget.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.460]   So it's better than a 50% drop,
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.900]   but it is a noticeable drop, right?
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.580]   And this drop, you can track it.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.660]   If you go from 30 to 40 to 50 to 60,
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.820]   you go from four to go and fill in
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.620]   basically the steps in between.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.620]   So there is an impact of longevity.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.260]   And it's important enough
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.980]   that we really should take it into account.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.380]   You can't just say, well, it works over 30 years.
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.780]   I crossed my fingers, it also works over 60 years.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.260]   That would be really financial malpractice doing that.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.540]   - And you've done a lot of testing with this.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.980]   Are you testing kind of more historical data
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.220]   or are you also testing kind of modeled out
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.260]   Monte Carlo future simulations?
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.780]   - So I've done both.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.740]   On my blog, it's mostly historical simulations
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.260]   and I've justified that in my blog.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.140]   I also like Monte Carlo in some way
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.700]   because now you can say we can run more simulations.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.620]   Obviously, the problem with Monte Carlo
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.060]   is there's always a bit of a garbage in,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.660]   garbage out proposition.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.780]   Of course, as I said, there's this hybrid method
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.140]   where you basically do the,
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.140]   you draw returns from the actual history,
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.460]   but then not just month by month,
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.900]   but really blocks of data.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.740]   So you can solve some of the problems there.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.260]   But I personally prefer to just use historical data.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.780]   - How can the average person
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.060]   who doesn't have that expertise
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.900]   start to model out what a reasonable number is for them?
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.620]   - So first of all, you don't need to understand
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.340]   all the underlying details.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.140]   That's why I did the hard work.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.540]   So people don't have to, right?
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.260]   So it's like if I'm sitting in an airplane,
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.740]   I don't have to understand all the mechanics
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.620]   that keeps that airplane afloat.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.300]   There's some people that thought about that for me
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.820]   and I just enjoy the ride.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.020]   And it's almost as simple as that
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.180]   for people who want to plan their retirement.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.980]   And again, as I said before,
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.580]   you have to do this as a personalized exercise, right?
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.380]   Because everybody's parameters are different.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.740]   So on my blog, I have a Google sheet.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.020]   So I have a blog post and in the blog post,
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.540]   I go through basically as a manual
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.540]   how I would use my retirement simulation tool.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.580]   And basically what you can do
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.340]   is you can put in your own parameters,
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.100]   your portfolio allocation, and then you can calculate,
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.740]   well, how would your personal retirement have fared
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.060]   in all the possible historical retirement cohorts
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.140]   since the 1870s?
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.700]   If you think that everything before, say the 1920s,
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.140]   that is so outdated and you can obviously ignore that
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.500]   and only look at what would have been the results,
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.420]   say post Great Depression.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.540]   And so anyway, so you can then do
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.700]   your personalized retirement analysis
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.900]   with your personal parameters.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.220]   What is your retirement horizon?
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.900]   What kind of future cash flows do you expect?
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.740]   What kind of cash flows are they?
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.940]   Are they inflation adjusted, right?
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.660]   Is it something like social security
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.300]   where you get a certain amount at a certain time
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.580]   and then that also goes up with inflation?
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.020]   It could be something like supplemental cash flows
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.220]   like many corporate pensions are not inflation adjusted.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.700]   So that would be some amount,
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.420]   but then that would be eaten away over time by inflation.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.140]   So there would be ways to model that.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.300]   You can hack your retirement
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.580]   and your retirement planning tool,
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.580]   probably in a way that no financial planner
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.340]   or no other free tool that you can find on the web
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.460]   would be able to do.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.500]   And so you can do this
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.740]   and then you can do it multiple different ways.
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.500]   You can check what would be the one level payout
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.140]   over my entire retirement horizon
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.660]   that would have still survived the entire horizon.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.580]   And then by the way, surviving means
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.660]   you can specify that too, right?
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.780]   So you can specify, are you okay with depleting your money
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.660]   versus having X percent left of your nest egg at the end?
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.020]   So imagine you have a big quest motive
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.900]   and you want to leave certain percentage of your nest egg
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.220]   to your kids or to charity.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.980]   A lot of my blog posts
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.740]   were taken straight out of this tool.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.980]   And I mean, so some very serious,
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:17.300]   very serious retirement planning research
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.020]   came out of just using that tool.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.420]   But I mean, it is really usable
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.620]   for just regular retail investors.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.860]   And it might seem a little bit intimidating
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.860]   when you first look at it.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.180]   But yeah, I mean, I have my,
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.100]   I think it's part 28 of my series
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.180]   where I go through what all the different features are.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.140]   And then there's two buddies of mine,
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.780]   they run a podcast, Two Sides of Fi.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.420]   I think they have done two or so videos
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.740]   on how they would use it.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.020]   And I think it's something like 30 minutes each.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.900]   And if you just watch these videos,
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.980]   so you're pretty much off and ready to go
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.980]   and you can probably use 99% of all the features
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.300]   of that free tool.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.020]   - It is free, so anyone can go get it.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.100]   And it's been really interesting
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.100]   to see a lot of the nuance of,
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.540]   here's what a reasonable withdrawal rate would be
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.380]   and at different confidence intervals.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.140]   But one of the things you said earlier
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.180]   was it really matters
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.500]   when in the market's current situation you are.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.300]   And you've talked a lot about the sequence of return risk,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.700]   which maybe you could explain a little bit
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.060]   and talk about how to even figure out where you're at
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.780]   and how that should affect your plan.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.980]   - So sequence of return risk means that
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.820]   if you are a retiree
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.580]   and you are taking money out of your portfolio,
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.420]   you face some different challenges
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.500]   from say a buy and hold investor, right?
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.620]   So imagine you're a buy and hold investor,
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.700]   you put your money in the stock market today
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.020]   and then in 30 years,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:52.260]   you finally open that letter from Fidelity or Vanguard
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.500]   and you see what's in there.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.940]   And it doesn't really matter
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.740]   how the market performed along the way.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.340]   The only thing that matters is your average return
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.460]   over those 30 years, right?
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.860]   So that determines uniquely
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.580]   what the final outcome would be, right?
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.700]   So imagine you had something like a 10% average return
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.780]   between now and the end point.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.420]   And it doesn't matter if you had poor returns first
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.620]   and then very good returns later on or vice versa.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.620]   And that's true for buy and hold investors,
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.940]   but it's not so much true for people
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.620]   who are either taking money out of the portfolio
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.060]   or putting money into the portfolio.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.060]   That's actually the flip side of this.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.220]   And I've written about this in parts 14 and 15 of the series
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.820]   where I drill into the intuition
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.820]   and the mechanics of what a sequence of return risk is.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.620]   And so it turns out that for retirees,
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.460]   it's not so much important what the average return is
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.980]   over your 30-year retirement horizon.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.900]   In fact, I have one chart somewhere floating around
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.620]   on my blog where I showed what,
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.780]   well, what were the failures of the 4% rule?
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.900]   What explains the failure of the 4% rule?
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.340]   And I can get you some example where the 4% rule failed,
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.700]   even though the buy and hold return
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.100]   from beginning to the end of the retirement,
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.700]   something like, I think, from 1968 to 1998,
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.380]   I think a 75% stock, 25% bond portfolio
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.220]   would have had a return of somewhere around in the high 5%
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.740]   or even low 6% in real terms, inflation adjusted.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.300]   Yet the 4% rule still failed.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.940]   And the reason for that is if you have very poor returns
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.700]   early on and you withdraw money along the way
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.420]   on the bottom of the market,
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.500]   or even close to the bottom of the market,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.940]   you are taking so much money out of the portfolio
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.820]   in terms of number of shares that you sell,
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.780]   that even if the market then recovers subsequently,
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.100]   you have compromised your portfolio so badly
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.020]   that even with a subsequent recovery,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.500]   your portfolio still runs out.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.260]   So it's essentially, it's the opposite of dollar cost averaging.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.660]   Because we're all familiar with dollar cost averaging
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.140]   and we tell people, "Oh, yeah, you don't have to be afraid
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.700]   if the market goes down and you put money in."
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.620]   Because the nice thing is if the market goes down,
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.540]   you're buying more shares.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.220]   And then if the market subsequently recovers,
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:33.180]   then those additional shares are going to look even better
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.100]   in your portfolio, right?
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.060]   Because you don't buy by the number of shares,
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.140]   but by the money that you put in, right?
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.540]   And you're buying more shares if the market is low.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.740]   And people are amazed.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.300]   So this is obviously a feature
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.380]   during your accumulation period.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.140]   And everybody is, once they find out about this
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.300]   and they think, "Oh, this is the best ever."
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.820]   Problem is this exact same feature hurts you
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.020]   if you're in retirement.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.780]   Because now if the market is down,
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.700]   you are selling more shares of your portfolio
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.820]   because prices are down.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.220]   And so this is the flip side of dollar cost averaging.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.620]   And that could actually wipe you out,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.460]   even though the returns
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.100]   over the entire 30-year return history wasn't even so bad
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.700]   or it might've been really good even.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.740]   So in fact, none of the failures of the 4% rule
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.300]   are because the average return was so low.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.460]   Every single failure of the 4% rule,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.940]   you had returns that on average would have been enough
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.380]   to sustain a 4% rule,
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.340]   but it's because of the sequence of return
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.900]   that you had very bad returns early on.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.060]   And then the subsequent recovery was too late.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.180]   You had already depleted your portfolio so badly
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.300]   that there was no hope at that point.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.580]   So that's what sequence of return means.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.180]   It's exactly what the name says.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.020]   It matters in which sequence
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.780]   the good and bad returns come in.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.060]   - So for example, in the $2 million nest egg
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.580]   that 4% would say, "Oh, I can take $80,000 a year out."
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.340]   If the first year you retire,
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:18.340]   the market's down 35% and you start taking 80,000 out,
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.540]   you're actually taking out more than 6% of your portfolio.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.860]   And if you do that three, four years in a row
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.780]   while the market's down, even if the market recovers,
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.900]   it's gonna make it really tough to get back there.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.940]   - Exactly, exactly, yeah.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.180]   - And so what should we do about that?
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.140]   'Cause obviously we can't predict the future.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.260]   Are there ways to know where we're at now
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.900]   and whether that should affect,
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   are we likely to be there in the future or ways to react?
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.540]   - So short of becoming a market timer
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.420]   and either knowing or predicting when the market drops,
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.660]   there's relatively little we can do about it.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.220]   So the reason why I've written so much
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.300]   about safe withdrawal rates
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.260]   is that there is no easy solution, right?
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.220]   And some of the blog posts I wrote would be,
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.260]   "Well, somebody pointed out to me,
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.260]   "well, can't we just do such and such?
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.580]   "And would that solve sequence of return risk?"
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:26.300]   And a lot of the proposed solutions
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.380]   are actually not really valid.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.220]   So people have said,
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.660]   "Well, couldn't we just do something like,
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.300]   "well, we set up a portfolio
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.220]   "that has a dividend yield of 4%, right?
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.260]   "Boom, we're done.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.940]   "We never dig into the principle
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.700]   "'cause the dividends are now so high
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   "that they pay out the 4%
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.540]   "and we never even have to sell shares when they're down.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.540]   "So boom, there we solve our sequence of return risk."
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.460]   Well, the problem with that is,
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.380]   well, first of all, dividends can be cut, right?
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.500]   So, and they have been.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.540]   Dividends, even if they are not cut,
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.940]   they could be depleted away by inflation.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.020]   So if you look at, say, even S&P 500,
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.660]   you look at the dividend income
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.580]   of one representative share in the S&P 500.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.180]   Yeah, it had some, it grew a lot, the dividend income,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.380]   but it also had some very nasty drawdowns.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.780]   And then during those drawdowns,
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.340]   either you consume less
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.820]   or then you do have to dig into your principle
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.020]   to make up the difference.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.860]   And then by the way,
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.860]   the S&P 500 hasn't yielded 4% for a long time.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.940]   So you have to supplement your S&P 500 portfolio
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.500]   with a lot of other stuff that is very high yielding
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.020]   and potentially very risky,
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.860]   something like high yield bonds or preferred shares.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.180]   So I checked that one out.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.780]   And so that doesn't really work.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.740]   At least it doesn't work reliably.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.980]   So the one thing that I propose
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.500]   that maybe doesn't solve sequence of return risk,
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.140]   but at least it takes a little bit the edge off
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.900]   is that when you retire,
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.260]   you're a little bit more cautious
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.580]   with your stock bond allocation.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.580]   So instead of being 75% or 80% stocks,
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:15.700]   maybe you start out at 60% stocks, 40% bonds.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.460]   You know, the good old 60/40, right?
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.620]   This might not be a bad starting point,
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.620]   especially today, right?
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.820]   Because we are recording this in early July.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.820]   So 10-year bonds are again in the mid 4% in their yields.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.180]   I haven't checked it this morning,
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.500]   but it was something like 4.48.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.740]   - I just pulled it up.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.500]   - Yeah, so right in the mid fours.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.500]   And it's not a bad yield for a relatively safe investment.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:49.220]   And so you start a little bit more on the cautious side,
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.500]   but remember, we also have
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.500]   a very long retirement horizon, right?
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.780]   And even at that 4.5%,
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.740]   after you take out inflation, maybe 2% to 2.5%,
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.900]   a bond itself has a little bit of a lean real return
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.260]   of maybe 2% to 2.25% right now.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.460]   So you need equities obviously in the long run.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.460]   And the way you do that is while you start very cautiously,
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.540]   but then you shift into higher equities
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.460]   later in retirement.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.180]   So that's called a reverse glide path, right?
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.420]   Because we know the glide path
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.300]   is the glide path into retirement
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.140]   where you go from high equities, low bonds,
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.540]   into more bonds and less equity.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.860]   And quite amazingly, this reverse glide path
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.020]   where in retirement you shift out of bonds
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.660]   and back into equities,
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.540]   it actually helps you at least very partially
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.300]   with the sequence of return.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.820]   So for example, I've had some case studies
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.660]   where maybe over a long horizon,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.100]   you had something like a 3.4% safe withdrawal rate
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.500]   with a 75/25 portfolio.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.020]   You can maybe raise it from 3.4% to 3.6%.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.980]   Again, you don't go all the way from 3.4% to 4%,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.700]   but at least you cover maybe a third of the distance
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.180]   to go back to 4% with this reverse glide path.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.580]   And so I'm not the inventor of this,
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.980]   but I've definitely done a lot of research on that.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.980]   So it's a guy called Michael Kitsis
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.420]   has proposed this weight file,
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.820]   who is a very big name in the retirement planning community.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.660]   So they have written about this extensively.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.980]   I have written about this.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.580]   So that is actually one route that you can do
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.900]   to maybe not solve sequence of returns,
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.780]   but you can alleviate a little bit
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.740]   because, well, you take off what...
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.260]   Because your retirement success
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.340]   so much depends on the first five to 10 years
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.460]   of returns early in your retirement.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.980]   Maybe you take a little bit less risk early on,
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.100]   but then you shift into higher risk assets
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.620]   again later in retirement.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.900]   So that seems to work.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.740]   Not much else really works.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.460]   There are some other proposals
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.500]   where you follow something like a market timing strategy.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.540]   You do some kind of a momentum trend following strategy.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.620]   I haven't published anything on that,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.220]   but I think that's gonna be my next blog post
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.140]   where I look into that.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.060]   That's probably gonna be part 62.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.540]   It solves some of the problems,
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.180]   but it also creates some other issues.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.020]   So it's like squeezing a balloon almost, right?
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.460]   So you fix this problem,
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.940]   but then the balloon blows up on the other edge.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.140]   And there were a few cases
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.180]   where a sequence of return risk
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.940]   wasn't that big of a problem,
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.900]   but then using that momentum strategy,
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.180]   suddenly it became a problem in that episode.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.580]   But I mean, this is something that people have proposed.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.660]   I am a little bit skeptical
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.260]   that this momentum and trend following
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.020]   is gonna work reliably.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.260]   Again, I want to point it out.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.580]   Yeah, but I mean, apart from that,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.540]   I mean, the only thing you can really do
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:09.540]   is be more cautious with your withdrawal rate, right?
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:13.660]   Take a withdrawal rate that in the beginning
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.060]   might be a little bit leaner.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.060]   And then obviously chances are
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.380]   you did not retire at the worst possible time,
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.580]   and then you would eventually walk up
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.700]   your retirement withdrawals.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.180]   And by the way, this is what we do
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.140]   in many other aspects of life too, right?
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.700]   I mean, when I fly somewhere and I go to the airport,
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.700]   I plan my departure time at home when I go to the airport
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.500]   to set the probability of missing the plane to 0%, right?
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.540]   I mean, there's nothing I can do about missed connections.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.740]   If you fly through Chicago in the winter
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.340]   or Atlanta in the summer,
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.500]   you might miss a connection
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.100]   because of thunderstorms or snowstorms.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.900]   But at least the part that is in my control,
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   right, I have this asymmetric risk profile
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.620]   wasting some time at the airport.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.140]   Yeah, okay, I can deal with that.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.900]   Missing a plane and missing a vacation,
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.940]   missing a cruise, missing a birthday,
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.260]   missing a wedding, missing a funeral,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:25.180]   that would be a very one-sided risk.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.820]   And I view it the same in retirement, right?
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.460]   I probably over-accumulated assets
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.140]   and I could have in hindsight retired a little bit earlier,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.020]   but I think the risk is asymmetric
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.860]   and I would rather accumulate a little bit more
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.580]   and retire a little bit later,
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.340]   but then retire in comfort and without worry
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.100]   that I run out of money.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.220]   And so, yeah, I mean, the best way to deal
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.420]   with sequence of return risk
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.580]   is to simply be a little bit more cautious
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.100]   on your withdrawal rate in the beginning.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.540]   - Now, you mentioned that in the first five to 10 years
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.140]   are kind of the most important
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.780]   when it comes to sequence of returns.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.820]   If you had a strategy where you said,
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.940]   "Hey, I wanna retire when I'm,"
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.780]   let's pick an age, 45, 50, it doesn't matter.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.540]   And you said, "But if when I decide I'm gonna retire,
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:24.460]   "I'm willing to say this is a bad time,
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.700]   "the market's not great,
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.980]   "I could work a little extra in those first five years."
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.580]   Could that level of flexibility
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.660]   give you the ability to actually retire a little earlier
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.420]   knowing that if something happened
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.420]   in those first few five, 10 years, you could change?
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.940]   - Basically, we're talking about flexibility, right?
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.620]   Can't I just be flexible and either consume less
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.580]   or work a little bit more?
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.580]   And I say, yes, absolutely you can and you should be,
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.180]   but make sure that maybe you model that too, right?
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.620]   And the way you can model that in my tool is,
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.620]   well, yeah, maybe for the first five years,
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.380]   you still model something like a side gig,
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.780]   and then you can see how much of a difference
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.020]   does that make in my safe withdrawal analysis.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.300]   I mean, there's some people who say,
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.020]   "Yeah, if you are just more flexible,
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.260]   "you could raise your safe withdrawal rate
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.060]   "to 5.5% from 4%."
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.900]   And I say, "Well, are you sure you wanna do that?"
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.660]   Because if you look at what your rule,
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.820]   what your "flexibility rule" would have created is,
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.940]   yeah, in the beginning, you withdraw 5.5%,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.740]   and then something bad happens in the market,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.260]   and then you go down to something like 2.75.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.740]   You have to cut your spending by half and say,
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.260]   "Well, you only do the necessary stuff and everything else.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.300]   "Either you don't spend
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.580]   "or you have to supplement with a job."
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.580]   And then the problem is people misunderstand
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:56.580]   that this spending cut or the side gig
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.540]   has to last for only as long as the bear market lasts,
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.420]   but it doesn't, right?
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.740]   Because your portfolio might be taken down so badly,
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.940]   even now we are back in a bull market,
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.300]   but your portfolio is still in a bear market, unfortunately,
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.340]   and it's still underwater.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.740]   So this flexibility might last longer
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.180]   than you are comfortable with, right?
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.860]   So what I always call this is, again,
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.220]   you take one failure
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.780]   and you replace it with another failure, right?
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.540]   The failure of the 4% rule is,
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.500]   well, you run out of money after 27 years,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.460]   and you almost create a worse failure
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.700]   by now all the pain starts very early on,
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.900]   and you have to go back to work,
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.620]   you have to cut your expenses, right?
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.700]   You are young and you have all of this drive,
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.940]   and now I want to travel, and I want to do this and that,
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.580]   and I want to volunteer more.
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.260]   And now you have to put this on ice again,
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.460]   and I have to put this on hold again.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.860]   And so I think that would be a failure of sorts too.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.340]   It wouldn't be quite as dramatic
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.020]   as running out of money at age 81,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.140]   but it would still be impactful for a lot of people,
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.500]   it would be impactful for me.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.740]   So, and again, I would say that
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.620]   if you have this flexibility, sure,
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.380]   model that flexibility and maybe stretch the flexibility
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.060]   for as long as you're comfortable.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.820]   And if you say, you know, I could work on the side,
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.060]   I could do some consulting, maybe two or three years,
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.460]   but after two or three years, it really gets old,
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.140]   and then I want to go back into retirement.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.980]   So what difference would this two to three years
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.420]   really make in my safe withdrawal analysis?
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.500]   And what I found is it's, yeah, it makes a difference,
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.540]   but it's not a huge difference, right?
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:42.100]   So be careful about it, because if some people say,
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.900]   oh, you have to be flexible,
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.260]   and then you can raise your safe withdrawal rate
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.620]   from 4% to 5.5.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.020]   First of all, it wasn't 4% to begin with, right?
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.700]   So even over a 30 year, I think it's something like 3.8,
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.380]   because they were at the 4% rate, there were a few failures.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.420]   So if you want to make it a 0%, it's maybe 3.8.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.060]   So you can't just take it from 3.8 to 5.5
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.980]   and expect that the flexibility
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.540]   is going to be completely painless.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.900]   It's actually the flexibility potentially
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.700]   would be quite impactful.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.740]   And I wouldn't say it would ruin your retirement,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.260]   but it would come close to ruining your retirement,
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:26.260]   because the flexibility, the length of the spending cuts
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.620]   and/or side gigs that you have to do in retirement,
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.660]   and the depth might be so painful
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.580]   that it might not be very palatable.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.620]   The other problem is, obviously, right?
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:44.100]   I mean, if you look at, well, when were these times
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.140]   when you needed to go back to work in the past?
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.380]   It would have been, say, you have a labor market
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.180]   like in 1932, when you had 25% unemployment rate,
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.380]   or I think even in the '80s,
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.900]   we had double-digit unemployment.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.940]   So it's usually not the best time to go look for a site.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.340]   Maybe it's easier for some people than others.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:11.340]   But yeah, so it's this whole flexibility solution
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.820]   to a sequence of returners.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.740]   It raises more problems than it really answers, in my view.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.260]   - I never thought about the fact that looking for extra work
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.660]   when the market is down 40% is probably not an ideal time,
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:28.060]   but is there any way, without predicting the future,
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.100]   that we could adjust our withdrawal rate
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.140]   based on current market conditions,
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.220]   whether we feel like it's over- or under-priced?
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.180]   - This is also something I found somewhere on the web,
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.260]   where people look at the Shiller-Kape ratio.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.740]   So Kape ratio stands
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.340]   for a cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.820]   So if we are stock investors,
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.660]   we probably heard about a price-earnings ratio, right?
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.140]   Our problem is, if you look at the,
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.900]   just the price-earnings ratio,
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.180]   and you can do this with backward-looking earnings
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.500]   or forward-looking earnings forecasts,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.900]   the price-earnings ratio is not really the best indicator
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.340]   for future returns.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.260]   And that's just because sometimes the market
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.180]   gets a little bit ahead of itself and then keeps going up.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.700]   And then, so some of the best returns
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.980]   happened when the price-earnings ratio
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.660]   was actually quite unattractive and vice versa.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.740]   And so what Shiller proposed is that,
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:28.740]   so we take a longer-term view of,
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.100]   we look at the last 10 years of earnings of the S&P 500,
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.300]   and then we also do inflation adjustment, right?
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.540]   Because these are usually nominal numbers.
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.260]   And then we look at today's index
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.140]   over this average earnings over the last 10 years.
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.300]   And the reason for that is,
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.060]   sometimes the market fluctuates,
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.860]   but at least on the earnings side,
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.460]   we take longer-term averages,
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.660]   because, well, sometimes during recessions,
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.300]   earnings temporarily could actually become negative, right?
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.100]   Because then what is a price-earnings ratio
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.300]   if earnings were negative, right?
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.700]   That's not that meaningful.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.500]   But if we take 10-year averages,
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.180]   at least we know that this is a little bit more stable.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.380]   And what Shiller basically said,
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.180]   yeah, I mean, you can deviate from long-term averages,
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.540]   but eventually markets are gonna catch up again
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.660]   with earnings.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.580]   And so looking at the Shiller CAPE,
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.420]   that, too, is not really a good predictor of next month
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.540]   or even next year S&P 500 returns,
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.660]   but it is a relatively reliable predictor
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.100]   of, say, the next 10-year returns, okay?
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.020]   So there is a pretty noticeable correlation
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.020]   between the CAPE ratio and 10-year returns.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.860]   And, well, guess what?
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:52.780]   10-year returns is roughly the horizon
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.140]   that matters for retirees.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.260]   So it's a natural extension
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.540]   that we, as retirement researchers,
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.180]   should look at the CAPE ratio
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.580]   and let that educate us
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.260]   in determining what should be the right safe withdrawal rate.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.300]   And then if stocks are very expensive,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.500]   so that means the CAPE ratio is high,
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.620]   or the earnings yield,
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.460]   which is one over the CAPE ratio, is very low,
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.180]   then we should also take back a little bit
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.140]   our safe withdrawal rate.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.740]   So now, basically, what you created
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:27.740]   is a method for doing retirement withdrawal planning
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:34.380]   that gets rid of some of this headache
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.980]   that you pointed out earlier, right?
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.860]   You start with a 4% withdrawal rate.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.020]   The market drops by X percent,
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.540]   and now, suddenly, you are withdrawing 6%, right?
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.820]   And you ask yourself, "Well, the market is down.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.420]   Okay, yeah, maybe I could withdraw a little bit more,
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.580]   but is it really a good idea
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.220]   to withdraw 6% instead of 4%?"
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:57.220]   So the nice thing about these CAPE-based
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.900]   safe withdrawal rate rules
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.580]   would be that you have a way to fine-tune
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.140]   and make dynamic your safe withdrawal rates
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.900]   because you would respond to market conditions.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.740]   The nice thing, though,
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.820]   if you look at this more valuation-based approach
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.900]   from the CAPE ratio,
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.580]   so imagine the market goes down
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.260]   by a certain number of percent.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.140]   Your portfolio is down.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.660]   But because the market is down,
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.660]   now the earnings yield also looks a little bit better.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.180]   So your percentage withdrawal rate goes up,
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.820]   and your portfolio is down.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.180]   So the net effect is that, yeah,
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.140]   you're still going to withdraw less,
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.500]   but not really one-for-one.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.460]   Maybe you withdraw 10% less.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.540]   So, and this would be a way to at least systematically
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.700]   and dynamically adjust your withdrawals.
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.700]   So there is a way to basically rethink,
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.860]   well, yeah, I mean, the market is down already so much.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.860]   I can now, I don't have to withdraw 4%
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.260]   of that decimated portfolio.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.540]   I can withdraw a little bit more than 4% now.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.460]   And you can do that in a systematic way,
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.100]   and it's, especially for somebody
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.700]   with a finance background,
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.700]   that's something that actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.620]   And also gets rid of this problem, right?
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.900]   So for the math geeks,
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.020]   if you wonder about the Bellman principle of optimality,
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.460]   right, so that actually would satisfy
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.420]   this Bellman principle of optimality
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.380]   in the sense that if your portfolio is down by X%,
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.340]   and now you basically re-optimize,
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.900]   and your behavior would be no different
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.620]   from somebody who just retired
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.420]   with that portfolio level at that time.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.300]   So you would both withdraw the same.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.860]   Whereas if you do the 4% rule, right,
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.020]   you withdraw now 6% of your decimated portfolio.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.260]   If somebody else retired with that same portfolio level
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.980]   and used the 4% rule, they would withdraw only 4%.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.020]   So mathematically, that doesn't really make a lot of sense
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.660]   that you both have the same portfolio level,
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.940]   the same age, the same retirement horizon.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.260]   You just retired at different times.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.220]   And the one guy withdraw 6%, and one guy withdraw 4%,
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.220]   it can't both be optimal.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:22.220]   Whereas this method that creates a withdrawal rate
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.220]   that's purely based on market condition and nothing else,
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.580]   I think that's a mathematically sound,
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.860]   and also I think financially sound method.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.140]   So, and by the way,
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.700]   this is something that you can also model
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.180]   with my spreadsheet.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:42.180]   So there's this, you can use the CAPE-based safe withdrawals.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:47.820]   But so as a caveat, it again generates this headache, right?
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.500]   It creates failures.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.220]   You never fail in terms of running out of money,
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.420]   but you would potentially fail in the sense that, yeah,
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.980]   if you retire at the wrong time,
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:04.140]   you might have to cut your withdrawals very substantially
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.140]   for long periods of time.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.980]   So it's not a panacea,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.780]   but it's something that if you have a little bit
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.420]   of flexibility with your spending,
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.660]   you should definitely consider.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.500]   - Is an option to just take a look
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.820]   at the kind of CAPE-Shiller ratio now and say,
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.460]   oh, it's high or low.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.260]   Maybe I should just be a little bit more aggressive
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.020]   or conservative before retirement,
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.940]   maybe work another year or not.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.780]   - Right.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.020]   And so right now the Shiller-CAPE ratio,
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:38.780]   if you look at Shiller's webpage, it's in the 30s,
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.900]   I think it's something like 33,
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.500]   and it's extremely high by historical comparison.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.380]   It's not as high as right before the dot-com crash,
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.220]   but I mean, we are talking about as high
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.300]   as before the 1929 crash.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.700]   So if, I'm not saying that the 1929 crash has to repeat,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.620]   but I mean, we are definitely now in an environment
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:05.620]   that looks exactly like some of the past market peaks.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.260]   And so I, again, I would say this is now the time
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.100]   to be a little bit more cautious.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.980]   And by the way, I also freely admit
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.780]   you should also do the opposite, right?
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.980]   So for example, when we were close to the market bottom
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.660]   in October, 2022, I wrote a blog post where I said,
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.460]   well, now is actually the market is down so much
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.180]   and the CAPE ratio looks very attractive again,
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.780]   now is the time to raise your withdrawal rate.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.860]   And actually 4% rule works again, that was back then.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.220]   Now I would probably be a little bit more cautious
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   because we definitely market looks a little bit overvalued.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:50.980]   And again, I do this on my, in this Google sheet,
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:56.300]   you can look at, well, what were the safe withdrawal rates
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.780]   and what were the probabilities of running out of money,
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:03.820]   say for a fixed withdrawal rate, like the 4% rule.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.340]   Well, the 4% rule normally works if the CAPE is below 20.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.060]   And if the CAPE is above 20,
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.220]   then the probability of running out of money
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.740]   is a lot higher than what you would deduce
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.620]   from the Trinity study, for example.
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.340]   So these are all things that I report
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.420]   in this Google spreadsheet exactly for that reason, right?
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.860]   You want to look at market valuations
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.300]   and then conditional on market valuations,
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.820]   you potentially get very different safe withdrawal rates,
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.420]   right?
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.420]   The safe withdrawal rate could be 3.8% if the CAPE is high,
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.660]   and it could be as high as 5% or 5.5%
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.740]   if the CAPE is really low.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.660]   But as you said, definitely take into account
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.900]   where the market is.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.500]   And we are recording this in July,
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.500]   but if somebody looks at this maybe three years down the road
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.140]   and we have very different CAPE ratios,
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.660]   you definitely want to make adjustments for that.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.780]   - This might be what you were referring to with Post 62,
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.780]   but if you adopt a strategy of starting your retirement
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:15.060]   at a kind of more reverse glide path approach,
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:20.060]   and one, two years in, you see a big market correction,
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:25.060]   can you increase or I guess decrease the failure rate
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.820]   and increase the success rate by at that moment
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.100]   shifting from fixed income to equities
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.900]   and increasing the stock allocation?
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.820]   - Right, and you could do that.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.380]   And if you are smart enough or lucky enough
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.020]   and you grab exactly the market bottom,
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.900]   you would look really good at that time.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.260]   Now, nobody knows exactly how deep we're going to fall,
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.260]   and so in that sense, this is why I like the glide path
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.900]   because it takes a little bit the emotion out of it.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.340]   You do it slowly over time.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.500]   And what that would do is
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.300]   if you really have a bad bear market early on,
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:11.180]   it would almost work like, well, by shifting the weight,
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.100]   you're probably going to effectively
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.700]   when you look at the portfolio every month
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.140]   and you take money out,
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:21.020]   it's you would potentially take mostly money out of bonds
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.180]   and you would potentially already shift money from bonds
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.060]   into equities on top of that.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:26.900]   So you wouldn't be,
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.820]   so not only would you not take money out of stocks
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.900]   that are being hammered and potentially beaten down
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.940]   and this overreaction on the downside,
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.060]   like we saw in March of 2009
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.100]   when everybody thought the world is going to end.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:45.100]   And so you would already do that,
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.220]   but you wouldn't pick one particular point when to do that.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.780]   You would do this over time.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.220]   - And that's just because you're rebalancing the portfolio.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.060]   - I've done some simulations on that too.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.260]   How often do you rebalance the portfolio?
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.660]   Should you do it every month?
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.940]   In my toolkit, I assume that it's every month.
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.780]   It's actually easier to calculate it that way.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.420]   A little technical side note,
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.820]   but of course in practice, you might not do it every month.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.380]   If you do it every second month, every third month,
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.980]   every year, results are still going to be very similar
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.260]   to my toolkit results.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.820]   If you never rebalance,
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.260]   then now you might kind of sort of wander off
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.460]   in some weird direction.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.300]   But as long as you at least occasionally rebalance,
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.980]   that's fine.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:33.260]   But so here's, so you're rebalancing.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.780]   Now the question is, what do you rebalance to, right?
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.700]   In the toolkit, most of the work I do there
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.220]   is a fixed allocation,
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.420]   and you specify that fixed allocation.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.260]   I have one little feature where you can do a case study
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.940]   of one particular retirement cohort
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.660]   and then check how a glide path
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.980]   would have performed better or worse.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.380]   Most of the, not most of,
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.900]   all of the time when you do a glide path
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.140]   from less equities, more bonds,
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.220]   into more equities, less bonds,
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.460]   you would do better in all of the worst case scenarios.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.060]   Of course you do worse if nothing bad happens, right?
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.580]   If the bull market continues
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.380]   and continues for another five years,
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.580]   and you had too little in equities,
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.700]   you would give up a little bit on the upside,
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.260]   but you're fine to do that, right?
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.900]   It's almost like an insurance contract, right?
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.060]   You pay out if you do well,
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.940]   but you make a little bit of extra return
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.820]   when the market is going against you.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:33.180]   So anyways, yeah, so this glide path
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.740]   has a little bit of this feature.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.060]   If the market goes down,
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.660]   you would actually shift somehow resources
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.460]   from fixed income to stocks.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:46.380]   And the glide path takes out the emotion
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.900]   and the market timing in that,
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.580]   because, well, what if you take your entire bond portfolio
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.580]   and to plow it all into stocks,
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.500]   and the stock market is already down by 30%,
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.340]   and then it goes down another 20%, right?
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.300]   How would you feel about that?
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:05.580]   You, maybe in the long run and in the big picture,
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.820]   it was still the right move,
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.380]   but you would probably feel a little bit emotional
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.420]   that you got that market timing wrong.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.740]   So it's better to do it over time in small steps.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.420]   You're not gonna get it completely right,
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.740]   but at least you're not gonna get it
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:17.980]   completely wrong either.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:21.140]   So that's the advantage of that glide path.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.260]   - To backtrack a little bit,
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:26.020]   you talked about and made a lot of references to inflation.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.020]   How, when people think about their withdrawal rate,
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.980]   their early retirement,
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.260]   how does inflation play a role in all of this?
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.660]   - Right, so obviously what you want to do
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:37.580]   is you want to adjust everything by inflation, right?
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.140]   Because nothing makes sense
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.860]   if you look at just nominal numbers.
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:47.860]   And so the gold standard that you want to follow
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:53.620]   in every single safe withdrawal analysis
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.540]   is that first of all,
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:58.820]   the withdrawals should be adjusted for inflation.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.140]   And then also when you look at,
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.340]   well, what is my final value at time X,
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.780]   that should also be adjusted for inflation, right?
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.860]   So obviously it doesn't make a huge difference
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.140]   if your goal is to deplete your capital.
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.740]   Well, $0 30 years from now,
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.540]   it doesn't matter if it's a nominal or real dollars, right?
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.300]   But if you have a goal of giving a bequest
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.780]   of a million dollars in 30 years,
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.300]   it makes a huge difference
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:33.300]   whether that is after inflation or before inflation, right?
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.300]   So everything I do is always inflation adjusted.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:45.020]   So when I say you withdraw a fixed value over time,
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.500]   that is all inflation adjusted.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.980]   And then when you specify,
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:53.980]   I would like to keep say 30% of my nest egg after 50 years,
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:58.100]   I want to keep that either as a reserve or as a bequest,
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:01.340]   then it's also 30% of today's portfolio value
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.860]   adjusted for inflation.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:05.500]   So inflation adjustments have to be always in there,
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.500]   otherwise you're comparing apples and oranges.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:11.700]   And I've seen people out there mixing up the two
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.420]   where they say, oh yeah,
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.380]   there's a 90% chance that after 30 years,
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.660]   you still have your original portfolio value.
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.140]   Problem with that is,
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.500]   that usually means it's a nominal terms.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.260]   And in nominal terms,
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.980]   the same portfolio value as 30 years ago
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.860]   could mean anything or nothing, right?
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.900]   That could mean it's 80% depleted
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.100]   if those 30 years include the 1970s and '80s
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.580]   when we had these big inflation shocks.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.700]   So as I said, gold standard,
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.740]   everything has to be inflation adjusted.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.260]   - One thing that I've heard a lot of people say,
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.540]   and I think inflation is actually the answer,
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.700]   is like, oh wow, if you look,
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.460]   everything from one month to 30 year treasuries,
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.300]   you're in the five and a half to four and a half range,
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.260]   doesn't that solve for the 4% rule?
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:04.260]   And is the answer, or the 3.25% or whatever it is,
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.380]   and is inflation the reason why you can't just rely
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.020]   on rates right now that happen to be very high
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.580]   for a long period of time?
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.900]   - First of all, and again, everything depends on,
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.500]   so first of all, your horizon
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.220]   and whether you are willing to deplete your capital, right?
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:25.100]   So first of all, treasuries are not inflation adjusted.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:28.900]   So it's actually, you have maybe 5%.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:33.060]   I've seen some CDs in the 5.4, 5.5% range
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.500]   over one year.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.340]   I think 10-year bonds are now down.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:42.180]   We just established that to about four and a half percent.
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.380]   30 years are probably also in that range,
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.780]   maybe a little bit higher.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.780]   And again, you have to,
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.980]   but to take out an inflation estimate, right,
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.380]   maybe two, two and a half percent,
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.780]   the real yields of treasuries
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.180]   would still be a little bit above 2%.
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.500]   The solution, if you want to completely hedge
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.300]   against inflation, would be TIPS, right?
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.060]   Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.420]   And last time I checked,
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:11.260]   they were yielding a little bit over 2%.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.460]   Let me check.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:17.460]   It's 2.31 for the 30-year,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.860]   2.31 for 20 years.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:25.820]   So in that sense, if you can get 2.31 over 30 years,
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.580]   so you do the back of the envelope calculation,
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.700]   if you want to keep your capital,
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.980]   you could model a 2.31% withdrawal rate.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.660]   It's not quite true because the more near-term TIPS,
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.980]   they have slightly lower yields,
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.660]   but it's also close enough, 2.12 to 2.3.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.820]   Let's make it two and a quarter percent.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:47.700]   So you could create something like a TIPS ladder, right,
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:52.700]   where you buy TIPS with all of the expiration dates
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.540]   staggered over your retirement horizon.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.820]   And then you get real inflation-adjusted returns
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.100]   of somewhere around 2%.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.180]   So it means you could generate a 2%
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:06.500]   or two and a quarter percent safe withdrawal rate
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.180]   with zero risk.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.700]   - That also leaves you with your entire principle.
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.340]   - That leaves you with your entire
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:16.500]   inflation-adjusted initial net worth.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.180]   So you could do that.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.820]   The other thing you could do is,
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.700]   and I always did that calculation.
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.820]   So imagine, and this is now boiling down
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.340]   basically to an amortization calculation, right?
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:35.340]   So imagine you have a 2.3% real yield.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:38.260]   Well, how much money can you take out?
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.580]   So you imagine you think of that as a mortgage, right?
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.140]   Instead of paying off the mortgage,
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.700]   you hand over the money and they pay you.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.860]   And then after 30 years, the mortgage then is forgiven.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.180]   So your money is exhausted
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:53.900]   and all you get is a flat payment stream.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:58.260]   It's actually, even with a 1.3% real yield,
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.980]   you could generate a 4% safe withdrawal rate
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:04.260]   and completely wipe out your money after 30 years.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:08.620]   So that's actually quite astonishing, right?
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:13.620]   Because the 1.3% return is what pays
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:17.020]   only maybe a third of your payment.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.100]   And the other part of it
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:21.140]   is basically just exhausting your capital, right?
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.860]   And so the nice thing is that
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:28.300]   you need actually relatively low real returns
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.460]   and fixed safe real returns
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.700]   to generate already a 4% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:37.780]   And so I actually wrote about that in part 61 of the series,
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.340]   which is called Safety First, right?
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.860]   This is what people understand.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.820]   Safety First is, you know what?
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:45.500]   Instead of worrying about a 4% withdrawal rate,
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.660]   why don't I just, instead of investing in stocks,
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:52.980]   why don't I just completely hedge my retirement
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.660]   and put money in safe investment
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:58.180]   and just either put it in an annuity.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.620]   Problem with an annuity is
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.460]   it's not inflation adjusted usually,
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:05.100]   but say a tips ladder would be
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.940]   the inflation adjusted method.
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:11.860]   And so, yeah, you could say that, yeah,
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.020]   even with a 1.3% real rate,
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.100]   you could get a 40% retirement
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.620]   and a 4% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:23.540]   Problem is it doesn't work for early retirees, right?
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.380]   - Yeah, because the maximum duration.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.860]   - After 30 years, your money is wiped out, right?
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.900]   Or you do the 2.3% withdrawal rate,
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.580]   which seems a little bit lean.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:38.580]   And so, yeah, I mean, this Safety First,
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:43.740]   I think it's a viable solution for traditional retirees
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.060]   who are willing to completely wipe out their portfolio.
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:47.980]   And maybe they have,
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.420]   or it doesn't mean that they don't care about their kids,
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.020]   but maybe they have already given enough
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.020]   of a headstart to their kids.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.820]   It may be paid for college, paid for home down payments.
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.140]   And they say, okay, kids, this is all you're gonna get.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.860]   Don't expect any retirement.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.860]   So you don't expect any bequest and any estate.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.060]   We're gonna leave exactly $0
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.300]   because we're gonna take our money
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.900]   and transform it into a fixed cashflow.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.500]   And that's gonna last us a lifetime.
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:22.460]   Yeah, I mean, it would be okay for traditional retirees.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.860]   If you retire at age, say, 40,
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.260]   and the longest you can structure with a TIPS letter
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.460]   would be up to age 70.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.540]   So now at age 70, what do you do?
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.580]   Maybe you have to set aside some money
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.020]   that you put in a stock market
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.420]   and let that grow over 30 years.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.220]   And cross your fingers that over the next 30 years,
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.100]   it actually grows to a big enough portfolio
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.500]   that then you quote-unquote re-retire.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:47.300]   But then again, so yeah,
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.420]   now your safe withdrawal rate is no longer 2 point something
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.540]   or 4% if you use that exhaustion of cap.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.500]   It's a little bit less
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.500]   because you can't take your entire portfolio.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.260]   You have to set a little bit aside.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.940]   And now you again have some uncertainty built in.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.700]   And that uncertainty will reveal itself at age 70
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.260]   because that's when you re-retire, right?
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.060]   That's when your TIPS letter is used up.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.140]   And you now have to look at, well,
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.660]   what did my stock portfolio grow to over the last 30 years?
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.700]   So you can, as for early retirees, it's a real headache.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.700]   You can't completely take out the risk
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.100]   with fixed income security.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.900]   And again, it's exactly because of that inflation issue.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:35.740]   You can't just go with the 4.5% yield in the 10 year
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.980]   or the 4 point something percent in the 30 year.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.540]   You have to factor in inflation.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.260]   And once you factor in inflation,
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.620]   some of these fixed income routes look quite unappealing,
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.580]   I have to admit.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.540]   - And you mentioned annuities briefly.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.620]   And one of the challenges is a lot of the annuity yields
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.100]   are nominal yields.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.900]   So it sounds great.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.580]   Oh, I can get this payment every year
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.660]   for the rest of my life.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.860]   Another problem, even if you could find one that was real
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.500]   is fees are high.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.020]   Have you, if you look at annuities,
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.900]   have you found any product or package
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.660]   that's even worth someone looking at or considering?
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.860]   - Probably the lowest fee, one would be an SPIA,
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.580]   single premium immediate annuity.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.500]   And funny thing is I realized I can even get it
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.340]   at my age already.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.820]   So I'm 50, I turned 50 this year.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.660]   I think they can go all the way down to age 40.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.660]   You can probably get an annuity already.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.260]   And the nice thing about that is
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:38.580]   that is such a standard product.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:42.060]   It really only differs by the credit rating
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.300]   of the insurance company, right?
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.980]   So if you shop around with all the AAA providers,
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:52.980]   you should probably get similar quotes
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:58.140]   and you just pick the best one because there's nothing else.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.580]   So there's no other bells and whistles.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.340]   It just pays as long as you live.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:05.620]   There might be some other issues with some survivor benefits.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.300]   It could be a joint survivor.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.260]   It could be only single survivor,
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.260]   but it's such a standard product.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.300]   By the way, you can even plan for it, right?
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.540]   You can plan that on average,
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:22.260]   inflation is gonna be 2% over the next 30, 40, 50 years.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:26.900]   And when you get X amount dollars today,
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.940]   it will slowly dwindle away
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.940]   from perspective of after inflation.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:37.980]   And maybe you don't transfer everything
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.020]   into the annuity, right?
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.700]   You keep a little bit of a reserve.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.940]   And then over time,
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.420]   when you realize that my purchasing power
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.820]   has been depleted, you buy another annuity.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:53.820]   And so it's possible in general,
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.900]   but again, because yields are,
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.620]   they are higher than they were three, four, five years ago,
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.820]   but they are still not quite as high
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.820]   that I'm super urgently knocking on annuity providers doors
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.580]   that I would be interested in buying them.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.260]   I would still take my chances
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.220]   with my stock and bond portfolio,
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.860]   but if interest rates were a little bit higher,
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:22.140]   I would probably start to look into that.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.020]   And again, it's never an all or nothing proposition, right?
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.380]   You could do a partial conversion
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.700]   of your net worth into annuities
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.660]   and keep the rest in your 75, 25 portfolio
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.780]   and run with that.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.340]   So again, this is something I wrote about recently
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.220]   in that part 61.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.460]   It's probably something that works well
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.060]   for traditional retirees
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:50.620]   that don't have huge bequest motives.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.380]   If you are a young retiree
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:57.100]   and you want to keep money as a reserve
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.740]   for say health emergencies
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:02.660]   or helping out your kid or kids,
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:05.100]   I would probably still hold on to my portfolio
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.380]   and not do the annuity round.
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.780]   - One thing that we didn't touch on,
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:12.220]   which is pretty relevant to a safe withdrawal rate
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:16.060]   is the tax situation of your portfolio.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.940]   So if someone has a $2 million net worth,
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.580]   that could be a $2 million net worth
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:25.540]   that has a cost basis of $100,000
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.820]   and will be subject to lots of taxes,
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.420]   or it could be a $2 million net worth
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.100]   where half of it's in a Roth IRA
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.620]   with no future taxes at retirement.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.620]   How do you think about taxes
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:40.620]   as it relates to the current value of that portfolio?
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:43.420]   - Taxes are obviously the whole additional layer.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.740]   So, and I have to admit in that Google spreadsheet,
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.500]   I don't model those.
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.340]   So that means what you take out of that portfolio
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.940]   is still subject to taxation.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:56.020]   Now, a good news is that in the US,
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.540]   I think we are pretty blessed in that.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.780]   I think if you stay below a certain income threshold,
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:08.380]   you can structure your retirement to be almost tax-free.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.940]   Maybe not in California because,
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.660]   but even in California, I mean, I did the math, right?
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.940]   So I think in California,
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.420]   I think if you stay somewhere below 60 or $80,000,
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.740]   it's the really high marginal tax rates don't yet kick in.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.020]   And I live in Washington, so I don't have state taxes,
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:30.260]   state income taxes, but yes, on the federal level.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.260]   So taxation, so adds to the complexity.
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.220]   First of all is from a cashflow point of view, right?
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.460]   Lots of people have everything tied up in a 401(k).
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.460]   Well, how do you access that now?
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.420]   So hopefully you could do some Roth conversions
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.620]   and then do that Roth conversion later
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.140]   over a five-year period.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.220]   And then you can take the money out of the Roth.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:58.540]   And yeah, but so the other issue is if you are lucky enough
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:04.020]   and you have a lot of money in taxable brokerage accounts
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.100]   and you have long-term gains that you need to tax,
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.340]   at least on the federal level,
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.860]   there are very high exceptions.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.580]   So first of all, you have the standard deduction.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.460]   And then on top of that,
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.220]   I think you have something like 79 or $80,000
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.380]   that a married couple can have in long-term capital gains.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.980]   - Looks like for 2024, it's up to $94,059.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.820]   - Oh, wow, 94.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:30.500]   I think, yeah, even in 2023, it was already over 80.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:35.380]   So you have these, if you structure everything
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.700]   as long-term gains.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:42.300]   And so there are obviously some tax hacks
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.780]   and I haven't written about those very much
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.620]   because other people have already done that.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.140]   So I think that if other people have already done the job
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:56.140]   to do that credibly and to my standards,
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:01.100]   and I don't have to redo the math, right?
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.140]   I think GoQuery Cracker wrote about it.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.380]   For example, at some point,
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.300]   you could do tax gain harvesting, right?
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.860]   So imagine you have a taxable income
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.380]   where you are below that threshold, right?
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.980]   Where you are not even maxing out
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.940]   all your 0% capital gains.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:23.220]   Well, you could sell some of your tax slots
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.380]   and then re-buy them again the next day
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.300]   or even the same day.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.380]   You just realize the gains,
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.780]   fill up the 0% tax bracket.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.820]   So you could do that.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:36.420]   You obviously want to probably make sure
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.260]   that you at least utilize the,
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.220]   I think now it's $27,700
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.980]   in standard deduction for married couples,
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.820]   at least fill that one in with ordinary income.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.100]   So if you don't have any other ordinary income,
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:54.500]   maybe you use some Roth conversions to fill that one in
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.260]   because that will create ordinary income.
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.420]   You might even fill up the 10%
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.740]   or maybe even the 12% bracket with some Roth conversions.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.740]   Yeah, so I personally haven't really modeled
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:14.460]   really too much of this tax optimization.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.300]   The way I think about it is I have something
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.540]   like an average tax rate of,
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.380]   and it's in the single digits,
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.060]   probably in the low single digits.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.020]   And so this is just the drag
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.660]   that it's basically like an expense
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.660]   that it's like property taxes for me.
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:36.060]   It's probably even in the same ballpark per year.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.660]   And I don't really model that any further
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.660]   as a lot of people in the FIRE community,
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.100]   I mean, especially if it's married couples,
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.820]   they will very likely stay below that.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.220]   And it's now probably,
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.460]   I think it's in the $120,000 range
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:55.940]   that you can have $120,000 in income.
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:59.820]   If you fill up your standard deduction
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.420]   with ordinary income and the rest
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.900]   with long-term capital gains,
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.180]   you can pay zero federal income tax.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.060]   And then maybe you go even a little bit above
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.380]   if you have kids and you can get
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.620]   the $2,000 tax credit in the US.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.940]   So the US tax code is extremely,
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.100]   extremely friendly toward early retirees.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.740]   Unless you really have such a big footprint
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.380]   where you're early retiree,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.460]   but then you also have something
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.500]   like a $200,000 a year lifestyle,
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.980]   then probably the tax planning
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.660]   is becoming a little bit more urgent.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:35.140]   But I've never felt a huge,
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.060]   huge urge to really stress out
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.260]   over any of the tax issues.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:43.020]   - It sounds like if you realistically think
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:47.300]   your kind of needs each year
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.580]   in terms of withdrawals from your portfolio,
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.220]   that would generate income,
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.180]   not just withdrawals,
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.300]   but the income on the capital gains
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:58.140]   are kind of above the $125,000 mark,
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.500]   taxes may play an impact more than you think,
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.140]   but still at the capital gains rates,
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.500]   not at the income rates,
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.980]   which can be lower.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.140]   Okay, so I mentioned I wanted to talk
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.700]   a little bit about portfolios.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.500]   We talked about the reverse glide path,
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.180]   which probably explains why target date funds
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:19.380]   could be a pretty terrible choice
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.060]   if they're doing the inverse.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.980]   But you could also make a case
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.340]   often as someone being aggressive,
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:28.020]   especially with bonds where they were
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.220]   prior to the last few years
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:32.060]   of being 100% stocks.
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.460]   How do you think about that allocation
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.180]   during accumulation,
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.180]   since we kind of talked about
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.300]   what it could be in retirement?
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.780]   - Right, so accumulation,
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.900]   I have done 100% equities
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.620]   and it worked for me.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.380]   It might be a little bit too volatile for some people,
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:52.260]   but pre-retirement glide paths,
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:55.180]   how crazy is it to hold 100% equities until retirement?
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.820]   So that's part 43 of my series.
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:00.660]   And so I make the point that
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.980]   on your accumulation path,
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:07.980]   it's defensible to have 100% equities until retirement.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.260]   And the nice thing is,
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.660]   well, of course the problem with that is,
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.100]   well, what if at your retirement date,
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.740]   you just are in the middle of a recession
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:21.140]   and your portfolio got so clobbered that,
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.500]   well, suddenly you can't retire anymore.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.860]   So that would be the risk.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:29.900]   Remember, maybe at that bottom of the market,
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.900]   you don't have to apply the 4% rule.
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.940]   You could probably apply the 6% rule
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.180]   because the equity valuations are, again, much better.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.820]   But even if you say,
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.780]   well, there's a little bit of risk that
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:44.780]   at that target date that I want to retire,
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.940]   well, maybe my portfolio is really down
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.980]   and I have a little bit of flexibility about,
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:52.820]   well, if I maybe work a year longer,
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:55.820]   would that be such a big concern?
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.540]   Yeah, if you have a little bit of flexibility
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.820]   in your retirement date,
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:04.820]   maybe you could do that 100% equity portfolio.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.300]   For example, I had it, right?
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.700]   So I said, well, if in 2018, when I want to retire,
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.460]   the market totally evaporates,
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.700]   well, then I'm just gonna stay another year at my old job.
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:20.300]   So it's not the worst thing.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:24.100]   I was actually a good job and liked everybody around me.
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.700]   So it wasn't terrible.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.420]   But of course, there are some people who say that,
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.660]   yeah, I want to retire after,
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.660]   say, 20 years of government service,
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.180]   and I don't want to work a week longer.
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.660]   And if the market is down at that time,
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.460]   then that would be a huge problem.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.180]   So in that case, yes, absolutely.
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.060]   You want to do a glide path,
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.700]   and the glide path would be
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:48.340]   just like a target date retirement glide path.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.700]   Now, I personally don't like
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.180]   these traditional target date funds
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:56.380]   because they start shifting from 90/10,
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:01.380]   90% stocks, 10% bonds, into something like 50/50,
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:05.300]   probably 55% stocks might be still,
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.340]   some providers would offer that.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.900]   The problem with that is you would do that over 20 years.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.740]   Well, most people don't even accumulate for 20 years
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.740]   if they plan fire, right?
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:19.420]   So you can't really use the traditional glide path
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.620]   for target date funds.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:25.820]   So you have to, and I ran some simulations.
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.620]   Well, how would the optimal glide path look like
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:33.620]   for somebody who has a much shorter accumulation period?
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.460]   And well, it turns out that the shape
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.660]   of the glide path still is the same.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.180]   You start very high equity,
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.140]   and then you shift into bonds,
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.460]   and you kind of, at the halfway point,
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.940]   you start shifting into bonds.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:50.300]   Well, if your accumulation period is only 10 years,
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.140]   well, you actually start shifting into bonds
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.020]   five years before retirement.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:56.780]   If your accumulation period is five years,
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.420]   you would start shifting into bonds
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.100]   maybe at the two or three year mark.
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.620]   So it's, qualitatively, it's the same glide path,
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.820]   but it's compressed.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.700]   So it's not, you don't take the last five years
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.060]   of the target date fund,
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.420]   where you go, say, from 60% stocks to 50% stocks.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.100]   That would be way too conservative
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.700]   for most early retirees.
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:22.300]   So, and actually, I ran some simulations,
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.940]   and that's actually where I ran
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:28.620]   both historical simulations and also Monte Carlo.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.380]   And yeah, so I agree.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.580]   I think 100% equities is actually not bad.
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.540]   And so, by the way, in the target date funds
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:39.460]   that the big fund companies put out,
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.420]   it's 90% is the maximum stock.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.900]   It's actually, I think it's an ERISA regulation.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.340]   You cannot go above 90% stocks.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:50.220]   If you do it yourself, you can definitely do 100%
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.780]   because you don't have to follow those regulations.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.820]   And I actually think 100% is better than 90%.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.940]   And so that 10% fixed income,
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.660]   that's really just a fig leaf for,
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.140]   so nobody can claim
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.020]   that you didn't have enough diversification,
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.460]   and nobody can sue you if somebody's unhappy
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:12.180]   with having big losses in their 401(k).
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:16.220]   If you're familiar with JL Collins
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.740]   and all the gang from the personal finance community,
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.460]   yeah, yeah, I mean, you can take a little bit
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:21.740]   of a bear market in between.
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.420]   You know, market goes up again.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:27.420]   And so, yes, absolutely, 100% equities.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.420]   It worked for me personally.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.700]   If you have a stomach and an appetite for that,
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.940]   I recommend it to everybody who listens.
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:40.940]   But I also say that if you have concerns
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.860]   about you don't want to work way past
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:45.700]   that planned retirement date,
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.980]   maybe do a little bit of a glide path into more bonds.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.980]   And then I tell people, hey, it's not forever, right?
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.220]   Because then you can do the reverse glide path again
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.060]   in retirement.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.180]   So you do something that's called,
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.620]   they call it a bond tent, right?
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.700]   Because the bond allocation then looks like a tent, right?
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.060]   It goes up as you go to retirement,
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.380]   and then it goes down again as you're in retirement.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:11.020]   And it looks like this triangle and a tent.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:15.220]   And that is actually recommended by Kitsis
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:20.220]   and Pfau and me, that that seems to be something
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.420]   that takes a little bit the edge
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.060]   off of the sequence of return risk, right?
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.980]   And again, sequence of return risk, right?
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:32.580]   It affects both savers and retirees, right?
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:37.420]   So the last few years of your accumulation phase,
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.300]   you also have sequence of return risk.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.620]   You don't want to have the really bad returns
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.420]   towards the end of your accumulation period.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:47.700]   Or if you do, you want to hedge against that a little bit.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.940]   You don't want to be 100% equities right around the end
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.260]   when you have that huge portfolio.
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.100]   And then on the way out again,
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.900]   that also helps you with the sequence
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.620]   of return risk in retirement.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:05.620]   So this is not some voodoo science or anything.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.220]   There's actually some economic
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.820]   and mathematical principles behind that, right?
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.260]   Because basically what you do
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.540]   is the glide path into retirement, right?
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:18.460]   Why do you start high equities, low bonds?
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.900]   Because your contributions over your next 40 years,
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.020]   they are something of a long bond position, right?
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.620]   So they act, but they are not a long bond position,
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.940]   but they act like a long bond position, right?
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.100]   And because you're so overweight with bonds,
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.780]   you don't want to pile on even more bonds,
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.220]   so you start with very high equity.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.980]   But then as you get closer to your retirement date,
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.700]   your human capital becomes less and less
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.980]   and your future incomes and your future contributions
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:46.260]   into your nest egg become less and less.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.620]   And that's why now you put bonds into your portfolio
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.180]   because you run out of bonds,
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.860]   quote unquote, in your human capital.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.220]   And the same with your retirement.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.500]   Well, what is your retirement?
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.780]   You're taking money out of your portfolio.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:02.060]   In some way, that's a short bond position, right?
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.660]   Because it's almost like a liability
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:08.020]   you take out of your portfolio every year.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.100]   There's some cash flow
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:13.060]   and it's relatively certain and predictable.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.820]   So it acts like a bond.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.340]   And because you take it out of your portfolio,
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.780]   it acts like a short position in bonds.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:23.780]   And in order to overcome this risk
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:25.060]   of having a short bond position,
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.140]   you want to have more bonds
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.740]   at the beginning of your retirement.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.820]   But then over time, you can phase that out again.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.180]   So this explains why you both go into bonds
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.780]   as you reach retirement
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:38.220]   and then out of bonds as you progress in retirement.
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.100]   So there's some math and some intuition behind it.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.060]   It's not just a pure numerical result
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.740]   and nobody understands why that happens.
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.140]   There's this very good understanding why that happens.
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.620]   And it's very intuitive,
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:55.420]   which makes me wonder why this has never reached
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:57.980]   the target date fund industry,
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.500]   because basically what that means
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.220]   in the target date funds post-retirement,
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.340]   they should go back into equities,
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.420]   but they actually shift further out of equities
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:09.940]   and go more into even shorter term bonds.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:13.820]   And again, I'm not a lawyer or anything.
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:17.860]   Maybe there's some regulation that mandates even that,
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.580]   but definitely the math,
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:23.700]   both the empirical results from past simulations
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:27.180]   and then also the mathematical and financial intuition
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.180]   points toward that bond tent.
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:30.460]   And it's not done.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:32.780]   Only the one half of the bond tent is done,
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.380]   but not the other in target date funds,
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.660]   which is mind-blowing.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:39.260]   - I think we have a version of saying
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.180]   this thing that we've done for a long time
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:42.620]   is actually not right.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.140]   So I would imagine there's something with,
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.900]   oh, yeah, the thing we sold you and we've been,
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.740]   it's all wrong.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.300]   We've got a new way and it's better.
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.820]   I feel like people would rather keep doing the wrong thing
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.580]   than admit that there's a better thing
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:55.620]   that they didn't know about.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.340]   But I don't know, I'm not in charge.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:58.220]   I don't know.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.220]   - Yeah, yeah, maybe that's how that comes about, yeah.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.180]   - Within the equity position,
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.860]   we've talked a lot about recessions in the United States.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.020]   You've talked a lot about the S&P.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:11.780]   What role does international diversification,
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:14.020]   whether it's developed or emerging markets,
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:17.180]   have in the way you have equities?
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.980]   - Right, so I have some international.
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.860]   I probably have less international
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:24.700]   than would have been recommended just by pure market cap.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:27.700]   I think right now US market cap is,
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:30.580]   of the US market cap of the overall world market cap
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.260]   is definitely over 50%.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:37.260]   But I probably have probably closer to 90%
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:42.140]   equity allocation is in US domestic equity.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:46.820]   So, and it's just, I always had it that way
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:49.300]   and it's hard to move it,
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:51.260]   especially because then you realize,
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.860]   well, what if I move it just at the wrong time?
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:58.020]   And, but so far it's actually served me well.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.380]   So the nice thing, obviously, that we have in the US
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:06.380]   is that we are big enough and important enough
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:10.500]   that you can probably get away
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.100]   with an all US equity portfolio
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.780]   in the sense there is probably not that much diversification
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:17.980]   from international stocks.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.820]   And then of course there is diversification, right?
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:22.260]   I mean, and you can basically draw
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:26.180]   an efficient frontier diagram of past return data
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:28.140]   and then you put in international stocks
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.820]   and then you see that the efficient frontier
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.060]   expands a little bit.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.540]   So that's all really nice and good.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.820]   So I agree with that, I don't doubt that.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.220]   What I'm saying is that we are very different
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:43.500]   from say an investor in New Zealand or Belgium, right?
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.380]   I mean, if you're in some of these small countries
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.700]   and you have only domestic stocks,
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:52.260]   you really run the risk that your country
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:54.780]   goes through some very idiosyncratic crisis
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:57.980]   and you could have gotten diversification
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.820]   from international equities.
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:05.540]   But it's also true that every single US recession
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:08.180]   and bear market has spread across the world, right?
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:11.540]   So on the way down for sure,
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:18.180]   every correlation in the equity world
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.860]   pretty much goes to one, right?
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.580]   If we have a recession and bear market in the US,
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.620]   everybody will feel it.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:28.380]   I think the diversification for international stocks
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:32.020]   probably comes more from the non-recession times, right?
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:36.500]   There were times where the recovery, for example,
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.900]   out of the dot-com crisis was better abroad.
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.780]   So part of that had to do with just the stock markets
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:44.860]   doing better there.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:46.700]   And part of it was also basically
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:49.780]   just an exchange rate effect, right?
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.660]   So if the dollar depreciates,
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.780]   you will be better off with the foreign stocks.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.860]   It has nothing to do with diversification.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.460]   It has more to do with basically currency
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:01.260]   and economic diversification.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.420]   But I mean, it's definitely true that
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.420]   when we have bad bear markets in the US,
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.580]   you have also bad bear markets abroad.
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.300]   But it's also been true that post-global financial crisis,
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.340]   the US recovered much better from that.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:22.380]   So Europe had very, very weak
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.220]   and very disappointing recovery.
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:28.820]   Also post-pandemic, lots of Europe has not done very well.
[01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:33.820]   So I've been very happy with my US-centric allocation.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.260]   It's in the back of my mind,
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.780]   should I maybe now that I've done so well
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:43.380]   with being US-centric, should I now diversify?
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:44.900]   Because at some point,
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:48.260]   Europe and rest of the world is going to come back.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:54.220]   I also have to tell you that, so I'm from Europe, right?
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.540]   I'm from Germany.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:59.580]   And so obviously I'm in the US because I like it better here.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:04.580]   So I think the US economy is a better functioning economy.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.580]   And it's more dynamic.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:12.580]   And I think it's better run overall than a lot of Europe.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.940]   So I have a little bit of an aversion against Europe
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:20.500]   because overall, I think the US is the stronger economy
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.380]   and has more growth prospects.
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:25.500]   Now, of course, as an efficient market proponent,
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.740]   well, it should be already priced.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.020]   And this, by the way, explains why Europe valuations,
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.180]   price earnings ratios look much more attractive.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.340]   It's much cheaper.
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:39.060]   It's also, well, it could also be cheaper for a reason,
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:44.060]   right, and the reason is that one single stock in the US,
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:45.620]   I think somebody did the calculation,
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:50.300]   Nvidia is worth more than the entire market capitalization
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.020]   of most European stock markets, right?
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:56.180]   So, and that tells you something,
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:58.020]   there's all of the big innovation
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.780]   and all of the, especially the AI innovation,
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.620]   that will all come from the US.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.980]   And I think this is why everybody
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.060]   is crowding into the US.
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.780]   This is why probably I'm also not that,
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:13.940]   it's not itching me to diversify.
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.140]   I have a little bit, maybe 10% non-US stocks,
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.140]   it's all index funds, by the way.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.700]   I, yeah, I have a strong belief
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.860]   that the US will do very well.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.780]   And then again, I mean, nobody else
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:28.700]   but US investors should think that way, right?
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:31.500]   If you're Canadian, if you're Australian,
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.100]   if you're from New Zealand,
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:34.300]   it should be exactly the other way.
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.100]   Or you probably have to have at least 50%
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:38.100]   of your portfolio should be US stocks.
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:44.260]   But we have a great luxury that we can be oblivious
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:46.140]   to what's going on abroad.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:48.220]   - Four quick portfolio things we can run through.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.380]   I'm curious to get your take.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:52.900]   We talked about rebalancing already, so I'll skip that one.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.980]   What's your take on tax loss harvesting?
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:58.460]   - Yeah, I mean, tax loss harvesting, I have done it myself.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.220]   I think it's a neat tool.
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:04.660]   The sad thing is that if you have no gains
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:06.940]   to use them as an offset
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:09.740]   and you are bound by these $3,000 a year,
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:18.100]   so you can write off $3,000 against your ordinary income
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.860]   from tax loss harvesting.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:25.420]   Some people will argue it's not really worth the hassle
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:27.660]   to do that.
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:32.660]   For me, personally, because I generate some capital gains,
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:34.500]   so I do some options trading,
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.940]   and that generates both short-term
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.020]   and long-term capital gains.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.940]   So I have done tax loss harvesting,
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:44.780]   and it's offsetting some of that income.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.860]   And I've used that very heavily.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.700]   So I think it's a useful tool.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:53.700]   I've used it, and it brings up a whole other issue.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.020]   So for example, a lot of people now
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.740]   want to do direct indexing, right?
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.700]   So instead of buying the index fund,
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.460]   they still do the index, they still do the S&P 500 index,
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.660]   but they implement the S&P 500 index
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.180]   with the underlying constituents.
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.500]   And then you can do a lot more tax loss harvesting.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.940]   And yeah, I mean, if you have enough gains to offset,
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:17.300]   it might be a really good idea.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.340]   And I know your connection
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:21.620]   with Wealthfront and everything.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:26.580]   So I can see how, so for some people
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:30.820]   with a lot of taxable gains that they want to offset,
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.180]   that is very useful.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.900]   If you don't have a lot of taxable gains
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:39.900]   and the $3,000 is all you can really offset every year,
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:46.580]   it might be a whole lot of hot air over nothing.
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:50.660]   But I mean, definitely for a lot of people,
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.260]   tax loss harvesting can be super helpful.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.860]   - My other criticism of it,
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:58.940]   I'm not gonna let my past employer influence my opinions,
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:03.940]   is that especially for people who are early retirement,
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:06.940]   when you're not actively contributing
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.020]   to your investment portfolio,
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.820]   you end up in a place where there aren't a lot of losses.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:15.020]   So my portfolio right now is,
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:19.940]   during the pandemic, did a lot of tax loss harvesting.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:23.420]   And so since the floor of the pandemic,
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:26.140]   the market's up quite significantly.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.060]   I don't have any losses to harvest
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:31.180]   because my cost basis is now so, so low.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.500]   And the unfortunate thing is I now have this large amount
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.140]   of carry forward capital losses
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.500]   that I would need to find a use for.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:44.380]   I actually do have some gains in individual equity positions
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.660]   that I would like to get out of.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.740]   And so it turns out that it's a good opportunity.
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:51.420]   But if you're not actively contributing,
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:53.780]   if you have a big nest egg already,
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:55.660]   the value of tax loss harvesting
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.340]   diminishes quite significantly.
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:29:59.220]   - Right, right.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:00.740]   One way would be, so for,
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:03.580]   I don't know how you do any kind of, so cash management.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:07.180]   So imagine you have $100,000 cash reserve or something.
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:12.180]   So there is a new ETF, it's called BOXX, B-O-X-X.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:16.420]   And it does some options trading and it creates,
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:19.380]   basically recreates a three-month T-bill,
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.580]   but the income comes in terms of capital gains
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:24.940]   and they don't pay dividends.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:28.300]   So your return would come in terms of capital gains.
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:31.500]   So you could create something that looks like
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.780]   a cash or money market portfolio, but the way,
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:36.780]   and then on top of that,
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:39.380]   you only get taxed when you realize the gains.
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.140]   So you could create basically
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:44.100]   three-month T-bill interest rates,
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.860]   but it's only taxed when you sell
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.140]   and generate gains.
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.700]   But then when you generate the gains,
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.660]   they would be capital gains and not ordinary income.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:56.580]   So if you have a lot of stuff to offset,
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.420]   you could use that to offset something
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.100]   that would have otherwise been ordinary income taxes.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.580]   - Yeah, I actually read the post you wrote
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:04.020]   about that strategy.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:07.780]   And in it, you advocated for some people,
[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:10.180]   it's a better deal to execute yourself.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:12.100]   But if you live in California
[01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:14.300]   and you're in a high state tax bracket,
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:16.900]   it's particularly, it's particularly good.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:18.780]   - It's very painful, it's very painful.
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.100]   Yeah, yeah, I agree there.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.220]   - So I haven't looked too much, but I will.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:25.580]   And what about asset location, right?
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.620]   We talked about allocation,
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:29.540]   but do you think very strategically
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:31.780]   about where you put all of your assets
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:34.100]   across retirement and non-retirement accounts?
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.020]   Or do you kind of just keep
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.180]   that same consistent portfolio everywhere?
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:41.940]   - I think it's pretty much consistent almost everywhere.
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:46.940]   And so I wrote about that, which one is that one?
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:50.740]   Asset location, that's part 35.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.660]   So do bonds really belong in retirement accounts?
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:58.180]   And so it's not a complete slam dunk,
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:02.060]   but it used to be, and it's probably now back
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.900]   to exactly that scenario.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:07.500]   Again, if bonds pay relatively high interest rates,
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:11.740]   then probably bonds belong into tax deferred accounts.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:14.660]   And stocks belong into your taxable account, right?
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:19.660]   So, and the reason is that you have to,
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:24.060]   bonds would be tax efficient in a taxable account.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:27.900]   - Especially, I guess, if you plan to sell those stocks
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.340]   at a point in time or those index funds
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.900]   where you can stay under that threshold
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:36.300]   at 0% capital gains, then you're really looking good.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.140]   - Yeah, I definitely follow that example.
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:44.620]   I don't really have a lot of real bonds.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:49.220]   I have preferred shares and I actually do have them
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:54.220]   in a taxable account, but they pay ordinary dividends.
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:58.380]   So that's taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:00.780]   As we said earlier, during the accumulation phase,
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:04.620]   maybe you want to have only stocks anyways,
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:08.740]   but even then, well, maybe keep your REITs
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:13.580]   very tax inefficient in a tax deferred account
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:18.580]   and keep your S&P 500 index funds in your taxable account.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.380]   There would still be a little bit
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.180]   of a tax drag from dividends.
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:26.700]   So you just have to live with that.
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.460]   And then on top of that, right, if we talk about,
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.980]   so somebody wants to implement a bond tent, right?
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:33.100]   Move from stocks into bonds.
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:36.620]   Well, you would do that also in your tax deferred accounts
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:39.500]   or in your tax advantaged accounts,
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.460]   because you don't want to have to realize
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:44.140]   a lot of capital gains.
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:47.180]   And then basically, and then by the way,
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:49.500]   you have the bonds in the right place.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:53.260]   So you have the bonds in your tax advantaged accounts
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.820]   when you want to do that bond tent.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.580]   Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.820]   So there is some tweaks you can do
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:01.980]   both in the accumulation phase
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.900]   and then later in retirement that, yeah,
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.820]   there's some tax efficiency planning to do there, yeah.
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:10.060]   - The last one comes back to my wealth front time
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.540]   where I remember looking at the,
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:15.020]   this was not in today's interest rate environment,
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.900]   but at the interest rates about three,
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:21.180]   four or five years ago, interest rates were super low.
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:22.860]   And all I could think about was like,
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:25.300]   well, we've got a risk score that goes from zero to 10.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:29.620]   Could you get to 11 by taking out a 10% margin loan
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.700]   and putting it into the portfolio?
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.420]   You've written a little bit about leverage
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.300]   and I'm curious if you think,
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:38.180]   the historical argument I've heard is,
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:40.100]   well, mortgages are fine.
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:41.300]   You can leverage real estate
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:46.180]   because you don't have any risk of default
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.740]   because you're locked in,
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.900]   but in a stock portfolio, there is that risk.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:54.740]   But at a 10, 15% level, there's not really that risk.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:58.980]   Do you think there's a case for juicing the portfolio,
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.220]   if you will, by adding on a little leverage,
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:04.420]   even if it's just leveraging up VTI?
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.260]   - Right.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.340]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.980]   Now, the question is,
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.540]   so the problem with that is that retail investors
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:17.980]   might find it a little bit harder to do leverage.
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:20.740]   And so you can always do leverage.
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:24.060]   If you go and you do leverage through a brokerage account
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:27.340]   at Fidelity or TD America or something,
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.220]   they will charge you margin rates that are so unattractive
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.340]   that it's not really worth it.
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:35.500]   You can go with interactive brokers,
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:40.500]   which is a little bit more for sophisticated investors.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:41.980]   So I have my option trading account
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:43.220]   with interactive brokers.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:47.820]   That works maybe a little bit better,
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:51.420]   but I think margin interest rate is still a little bit high.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.980]   I think they do something like
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:59.740]   maybe a fed funds rate plus a percent or something like that.
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:04.300]   And you can do leverage
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:08.780]   through this box spread trade that I mentioned once.
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.580]   So that would even make the interest
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:14.700]   effectively tax-deductible.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:17.900]   So that's a pretty neat way.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.020]   So it brings new cash into your account,
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.500]   and then you take that cash and buy more stocks.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.860]   You can definitely do that.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.180]   And again, the idea here is that
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.860]   it goes back to this intuition I told you before, right?
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:32.140]   So if you do a glide path optimization,
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.820]   and I've worked on this,
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:37.940]   I've written about it on my blog,
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:41.900]   but I did the maximum stock position
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:44.140]   would have been 100%.
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:46.500]   And the reason why 100% was optimal
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.300]   was not because 100% is optimal,
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.900]   it's because I set the upper limit to 100%.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.020]   So if you're really young
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:55.220]   and you have relatively little in investments,
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.220]   and you still have enough runway to retirement,
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:01.940]   yeah, you could definitely go above 100%.
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.940]   And as long as you don't do it too crazy,
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:05.500]   there seems to be some,
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.060]   in some bogleheads forum,
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.580]   there's somebody who wrote this horror story
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:10.860]   where as a grad student,
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.340]   he went into equities with some leverage,
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.260]   and then the global financial crisis hit.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:19.260]   And I think he lost almost everything.
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:21.980]   So bad things can happen if you do leverage.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.020]   I think if you do it reasonably
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.660]   and you do something like 110% equities,
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:30.500]   you do a little bit of extra leverage.
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.380]   I think that mathematically,
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.980]   it's definitely the right thing to do
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:40.100]   from say a lifetime asset allocation point of view.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:45.660]   And I'm not sure everybody has a stomach to do that,
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.460]   but if you do, you should obviously do that.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:50.620]   I guess the easier thing to do is say,
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:53.340]   if you already have a house and a mortgage,
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:55.940]   think of the mortgage as almost like leverage.
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:57.220]   So instead of paying down,
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:59.860]   instead of making accelerated payments on your mortgage,
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.020]   maybe put everything in the stock market
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.060]   and then keep 100% equity position,
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:07.860]   that's almost already like a equity with leverage,
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:11.220]   because you have the mortgage on the side,
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:14.820]   it is basically just the money is fungible.
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:17.780]   So think of almost the mortgage as the leverage.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:21.860]   But yes, I absolutely agree with that.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.860]   And it goes back to this idea,
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:28.860]   you already have a lot of bond-like allocation,
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.500]   which is an implicit allocation,
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:34.460]   which are your future contributions into your 401(k)
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:38.500]   and, or 401(k) or NASDAQ in general.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.580]   And because you have this big bond allocation,
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:43.060]   you want to overcome that
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:46.140]   and have maybe not just 100% equities,
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.580]   then it could be 110 or 120% equities.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:53.300]   And then minus 20%, you have some borrowing,
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:56.340]   ideally as something like a box spread trade
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.820]   where you can get, I mean, you can borrow money
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:03.820]   at maybe three months treasuries plus 0.3%.
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:06.660]   And that stuff is also tax deductible,
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:10.580]   which is not really the case with a lot of other things.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.220]   - Okay, I think I hit on all the portfolio stuff.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:14.540]   The more you talk about options,
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:17.260]   the more it makes me wanna do an entire another conversation
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.380]   about option strategies,
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.740]   'cause you've got a great series there.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:24.980]   We'll punt that for the future and we'll have you back.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:28.820]   As we wrap up, you're kind of one of the people I know
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:31.540]   who've gone through this early retirement thing.
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:33.780]   What advice do you have for someone
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.220]   who's still in that accumulation phase
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.660]   beyond just some of the stuff we talked about now,
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.780]   maybe more about the life and the mindset
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.380]   that you've picked up along the way
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:43.580]   that you'd like to share?
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.940]   - As I said earlier, if you're early on
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:50.860]   in your accumulation phase, go aggressive.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:55.140]   So 100% equities is not a dirty word.
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:00.180]   Also keep up the pace.
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:02.820]   So you have to almost rewire your mind.
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:05.940]   If equities are at an all-time high, great.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:07.740]   Momentum is working.
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.540]   I'm going to keep investing
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.740]   and this thing will keep rolling forever.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.180]   And then if equities are down,
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:17.660]   then, okay, forget about momentum.
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:20.340]   Now we think valuation, right?
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.220]   So now we say equities are cheap.
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:26.060]   So now is a great time to invest too.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.700]   So there's always a great time to invest.
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:32.580]   And think about that as what we said before, right?
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.980]   For retirees, it's a real headache.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:38.820]   There could be a bear market around the corner
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.540]   and you have sequence of returners.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:43.980]   The flip side of that is that actually a recession
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:48.980]   and bear market could work okay for savers
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:52.020]   because you have dollar cost averaging.
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.980]   You keep investing through the trough
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:57.980]   and you pick up more shares at cheaper prices.
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:40:59.460]   And then when the market retires again,
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:00.300]   you look really golden.
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.300]   I mean, definitely it worked for me twice, right?
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.940]   Once during the dot-com crash
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.780]   and once during the global financial crisis.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:13.780]   And so if you are still saving and preparing for retirement
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:16.740]   and saving for an accumulating for,
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:19.580]   whether it's traditional retirement or early retirement,
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:22.140]   don't really sweat the volatility,
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:25.580]   don't really sweat valuation so much.
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:28.020]   Worry about that later and then you can check out my blog,
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:32.460]   but on the way there, just keep plowing money in.
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:35.540]   And, but then at the same time,
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:39.860]   I also wrote a blog post it's called Stealth Frugality.
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:43.740]   So you don't want to overdo this frugality business, right?
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.740]   I mean, you also want to live a little bit
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:50.740]   and don't want to shortchange your fun.
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:55.620]   And I mean, it's really fun to live in early retirement,
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:59.500]   but you don't want to be too frugal
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.140]   during the accumulation phase.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:06.140]   And then because you might fall off the wagon
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.700]   and you might hate it.
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:12.940]   So even if it takes you maybe two or three years longer
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:15.860]   to reach that early retirement date,
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:19.260]   I mean, if the path there is fun,
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:23.980]   it's much easier to save for two or three more years.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:26.020]   So keep that in mind.
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:28.740]   - And would you say stealth frugality is just,
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:30.540]   be frugal where necessary,
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.660]   but don't be so frugal that everyone knows it
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:33.500]   and you don't have fun.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:34.340]   Or how do you think about it?
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:36.020]   - Well, people talk behind your back about it
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:36.860]   or something, right?
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.700]   I mean, you want to send some signals.
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:41.780]   So I never sweated, for example, going out for coffee,
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.780]   the work lunches.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.380]   So we would go out for lunch
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:48.780]   at some of our favorite places in San Francisco.
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:53.020]   And so, yeah, it's a little bit extra expense,
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:56.700]   but it's also, I value the social interaction
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:01.700]   and picking up the gossip around the office
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:03.380]   and connecting with people.
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:06.260]   And yeah, also making friends
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:09.140]   and actually making lifelong friends too.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:14.020]   So don't shortchange your accumulation phase,
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.140]   make that fun too.
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:16.940]   And then retirement will be fun.
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:17.780]   - And the last thing,
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.780]   do you think, one thing about retirement
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.260]   that because you're in it,
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:26.460]   maybe you can help me kind of grab with is,
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.780]   or maybe you can help me understand is,
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:32.500]   I feel like with all this free time in early retirement,
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.660]   you'd actually have more time to spend.
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:37.900]   And so if I look and say, "Oh, right now I spend,"
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.420]   let's use our old example, $80,000 pre-retirement.
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:44.700]   Do you think from all the case studies you've done,
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:47.140]   that number should be higher or lower?
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.860]   Because you've talked about die with zero.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:51.220]   One of Bill Perkins' points
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.300]   was people in retirement spend less,
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.780]   but what about people in early retirement?
[01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:59.300]   - So, I mean, obviously people in retirement spend less
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.900]   because you have this cliff
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.820]   when people retire at age 65 or 67, right?
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:07.740]   So maybe some people slow down already.
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.500]   Sometimes it's also,
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:14.140]   it's basically job-related expenses that you have less of.
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.500]   So for me, it's probably,
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.220]   yeah, we probably now might be spending more,
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:21.780]   say outside of some of the fixed expenses
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:23.100]   that you had in California, right?
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.260]   A big mortgage.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:27.100]   So that is now gone,
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.060]   but what you spend on top of the mortgage,
[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:32.460]   yeah, I mean, you didn't even have time to travel as much.
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:36.780]   And so we definitely spend more on travel.
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:40.420]   We have to pay out of pocket more for health expenditures.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.860]   Yeah, I mean, keep that in mind
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.380]   that some of that might change.
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:48.780]   You might spend less on work clothes and commuting,
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.540]   but yeah, you have more time to spend money.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.820]   You have more bandwidth.
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:53.940]   You sit in front of the computer.
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:57.180]   Maybe just out of boring, out of boredom,
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:01.340]   you check out Amazon and do some therapy shopping.
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:05.700]   And so it could be a problem.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:10.140]   I definitely noticed we spend more on certain categories,
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:15.020]   but spending less on work clothes and less on the mortgage,
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.180]   and we have no mortgage right now,
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:21.020]   but yeah, it could be a problem for some people.
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.540]   You should have this guy on the show
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.620]   as Justin from Root of Good,
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.180]   so he can tell you more about it.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.300]   So he definitely, he has this theory
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:34.140]   that he's spending somewhere between $30,000 and $36,000
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:39.140]   on a lifestyle that would require a $100,000 salary
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:43.220]   for the average middle-class American.
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.940]   So he can probably tell you that,
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.540]   no, because you have more time,
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.100]   you can do more stuff yourself.
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:49.460]   You have to outsource less.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.620]   You can do more home repairs yourself.
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:54.980]   You can do yard maintenance yourself.
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:58.620]   So there are definitely going to be different views.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:03.620]   My personal view is, yeah, probably outside of the sum of,
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.060]   so if we had stayed in San Francisco,
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:08.860]   we probably would still have that cost
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.900]   and maybe a little bit more.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:13.940]   So maybe just purely by numbers, we're spending less now,
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:16.060]   but that's because we don't have the mortgage
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.500]   in San Francisco anymore.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.340]   This has been awesome.
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:21.580]   Everybody should go check out the series.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:23.940]   If they want to go deeper, we'll link to that.
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.260]   We'll link to the site.
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:27.540]   We'll link to the toolbox and the spreadsheet you built.
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.740]   Is there anywhere else you want to send anyone
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.740]   or any parting words you want to share?
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:33.460]   Check me out on my webpage.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:38.460]   And we probably have already common audience,
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:39.900]   but if you haven't found me yet,
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:42.020]   that would be good to check me out.
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:44.020]   Early retirement now is where everything is.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.180]   Links are in the show notes.
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.300]   Karsten, thanks for being here.
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.140]   You bet.
