[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.000]   are to be found in the Gospel according to St. John
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   in the 7th chapter and the 14th verse.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.600]   The 14th verse in the 7th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   "Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught."
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   Or if you prefer it, "Now about the midst of the feast
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.000]   Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach."
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.400]   Those who meet here regularly Sunday by Sunday will recall
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   that we have been studying this 7th chapter of John's Gospel
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.000]   for a number of Sunday evenings.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.400]   And we have been doing so because it gives us a very vivid
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.800]   and very graphic picture of the reaction of men and women
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.400]   to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, when he was here in this world.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.200]   The business of preaching is to bring men and women face to face
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.400]   That is the primary function and task of the church.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000]   That is what these Gospels do.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.800]   They just bring us face to face with him.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.400]   Because it is the whole contention of the Christian message,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.000]   the New Testament in particular,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.400]   that the only hope for men and women is in this person.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.200]   Not only hope in this life, but hope in the next life.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   Hope for all eternity.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.800]   Nothing, therefore, is of such supreme importance
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.000]   as our reaction to this person,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.800]   Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   Well, now we are looking, therefore, at this chapter
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.600]   because it tells us of the reaction of various people to him.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.000]   And you remember that it all arose over this question
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   of the Feast of Tabernacles.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.200]   This feast came round, as the Old Testament has reminded us this evening,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.800]   once a year.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.400]   And the Jews were commended to go up to Jerusalem.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.000]   And they went up in great companies of people.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   They had their caravans and they would join in one another
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   and they'd form great processions.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.800]   They went from every part of the country up to Jerusalem
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.600]   for this Feast of Tabernacles.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.800]   And you remember how in the first verses of this chapter
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.200]   we are told how that led to that altercation, as it were,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.000]   between our Lord and his own brothers.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.200]   They were surprised that he didn't go up at once,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.000]   that he didn't go with them,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.600]   that he didn't join in the procession,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.400]   that he stayed there up in Galilee instead of going up to Jerusalem.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.600]   We've been considering all that.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   And there, you see, we have seen the reaction of his own brothers to him.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.200]   We are told specifically and explicitly in verse 5,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.000]   "For neither did his brethren believe in him."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.800]   And we've been considering the causes.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.000]   But now he himself has gone up to Jerusalem.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.200]   He's explained to them why he didn't go with them,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.600]   but now he's gone up on his own.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   As we are told, he went up, as it were, in secret.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.000]   He didn't go up with a great show.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.800]   Not openly, but as it were, in secret.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   And then you remember we were told that the Jews sought him at the Feast and said,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.400]   "Where is this man? Where is this fellow?"
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.800]   And then how, hearing that he was there,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.200]   a kind of muttering began amongst the common people.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   Some said, "He's a good man."
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.800]   Others said, "Nay, he deceives the people."
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.000]   However, they were also afraid of the authorities
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   that they didn't say this sort of thing very openly,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.800]   albeit no men speak openly of him for fear of the Jews.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000]   Well, there, you see, we've been considering various reactions to him.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Some praising him, some criticizing him,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.200]   and all misunderstanding him.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.000]   But now the story goes onwards, and we are following it.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.200]   Because now it's about to reach what, in many ways,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.800]   is the crucial teaching of this particular chapter.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.400]   Now our Lord himself, about the middle of the Feast,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.800]   went into the Temple, and he began to teach.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   He has his own time, as we've seen, for everything he does.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   But he now adjudges that the excitement has quietened down sufficiently
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   for him to be able to begin his teaching.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   So there he is in the Temple, and he begins to teach.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   And the question before us this evening is,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   "What did he teach? What did he say?"
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   It's vital for this reason that we are going on to consider again
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.200]   the reaction of the Jewish authorities, the religious leaders, to his teaching.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   The next verse is, "And the Jews marveled, saying,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.600]   'How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?'"
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.000]   And that leads to this important statement,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   "Jesus answered them and said,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   'My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.'
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.800]   And then, 'If any man willeth to do his will,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.600]   or whether I speak of myself,'" and so on.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.800]   Now, we can't understand all that teaching
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.400]   unless we are clear in our minds as to what he did teach.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.200]   He began to teach. What did he teach?
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   There seems to me to be no real difficulty about this question.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.000]   Surely the remainder of the chapter shows us quite plainly
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   that he taught them about the Feast of Tabernacles.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.200]   There are hints of that even when he begins to talk about the law,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.800]   but if there's anybody in any doubt at all about it, listen to verse 37.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   "In the last day, that great day of the feast,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   Jesus stood and cried, saying, 'If any man thirst,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.400]   let him come unto me and drink.'"
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.800]   Now, that was a direct reference to what was done
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.200]   on that great day of the feast,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.600]   when water was taken from the pool of Siloam
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.400]   and was poured over the altar.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.600]   He was taking a part of the imagery,
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.400]   the ceremonial of the feast,
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.000]   in order to preach about himself
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and about the forthcoming giving and shedding forth of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.200]   So there, quite explicitly,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.000]   our Lord was taking advantage of the meaning of the Feast of Tabernacles
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   in order to teach the people.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.200]   And it seems to me there is no doubt at all
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.800]   that that is what he was doing here at the very beginning.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.600]   He used the whole occasion, as was his custom always,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.000]   in order to bring men and women face to face with the truth of God.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.200]   He was able to expound the meaning of feasts
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.000]   in a way that nobody else could.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.800]   That's why these authorities were so surprised.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.400]   He was able, as we see in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.200]   to expound the law in a way that they'd never heard before.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.600]   That's what he did.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   He took the teaching, and he expounded it, and he explained it.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.200]   And here, I say, there is no question that that is what he did on this occasion.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   He taught them the meaning of the Feast of Tabernacles,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   why it had been instituted,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.600]   and what God intended mankind to learn from it and to realize through it.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.200]   Well, now, what is this?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   And the answer, of course, is to be found very clearly
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.600]   in that twenty-third chapter of the Book of Leviticus,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.800]   that portion of which we read at the beginning.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.200]   And I read it in order that we might be reminded of this.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.400]   Here, I say, is the key, then,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.800]   to the teaching which our Lord gave the people on that occasion
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.400]   there in the temple.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.000]   And I want to attract attention particularly
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.600]   to what we read in verses forty-two and forty-three.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.200]   "Ye shall dwell in booths seven days.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.800]   All that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.600]   I am the Lord your God."
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.800]   Now, you remember what happened.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.200]   On this particular date of this particular seventh month,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.400]   everybody had to go up in Jerusalem.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.800]   And there they had to make of themselves booths to dwell in.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.000]   They took down these various trees.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.800]   The instructions are here.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.200]   "You shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   and willows from the brook."
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.600]   And with these boughs and branches,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.000]   they were made for themselves tents, booths, in which to dwell.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.800]   And they had to live in them seven days, for seven days.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.600]   But, you remember, there were various other aspects
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.800]   to this great feast of tabernacles.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.400]   Why were they asked to do this?
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.000]   What was the meaning of all this?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.800]   Well, the answer is plain.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.400]   It was, incidentally, a kind of harvest festival.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.800]   It was a feast at a time when the harvest had been safely gathered in,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.000]   and when they were able to meet and face again
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.200]   the rigors of the winter and the coming spring.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   Feast of harvest, thanksgiving,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.600]   celebration of God's goodness to them.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:33.000]   But, and still more important, as this 43rd verse reminds us,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   "That your generations may know
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.400]   that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   when I brought them out of the land of Egypt."
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.800]   It is to be a permanent annual reminder of the exodus from Egypt,
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.600]   the traveling through the wilderness on the way to Canaan.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.200]   They dwelt in booths as they traveled through that wilderness.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   And they are to be reminded of this in perpetuity.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   It is something that is never to be forgotten.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   And therefore our Lord takes up all this and he teaches the people
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   the meaning, the significance of the feast of tabernacles.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.000]   What is it?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.200]   "Dear me," says someone,
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   "Are you really proposing to hold us with something like that?"
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.400]   We came here, says someone, expecting that you'd be
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:41.600]   telling us about capital punishment or euthanasia.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.000]   These are the problems of the hour.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.600]   Should people suffering with cancer be allowed to go on living
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.200]   or should we put them to sleep?
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.400]   Should a man that murders a policeman, should his life be taken from him?
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   These are the problems.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.800]   I suggest, my dear friend, that they are not your problems.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.200]   There are bigger and deeper and vaster problems for every one of us.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:19.600]   It's a nil day for the Christian church when our preaching is controlled by the popular press.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.800]   I'm not commissioned to preach to people what they want to hear.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:29.200]   I have a message from this book from God.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   What's the message?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.400]   Well, I think I can show you that what our Lord taught in the temple
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:42.600]   about the feast of tabernacles is the most urgent teaching needed by the world at this hour.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.200]   If all men but paid heed to this teaching there'd be no murders.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.000]   And you wouldn't have your modern muddle and your modern problems.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.600]   You see, the tragedy is we are approaching problems too directly.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.400]   We are not setting them into the context of God and of eternity.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.200]   It's because we're all so topical that the word of God isn't having its place.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.000]   The way to tackle the immediate problem is to go back to the ultimate problem.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.200]   It is true here as in other respects, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness."
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.600]   These other things will follow.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:30.800]   Very well then, I say, let us face this teaching which is here unfolded to us.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.000]   What is the first lesson, therefore, of the feast of tabernacles?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.400]   Well, it is a lesson with regard to the nature of life, the nature of our life in this world.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.200]   Here men and women are called out of their houses, out of their homes,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.400]   and they're told to live for a week, for seven days, in booths, tents,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:14:03.800]   made thus out of branches and boughs, a temporary kind of structure, for seven days every year.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.600]   You know, I sometimes think that there is nothing needed more urgently by this modern generation
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.800]   to which you and I belong, than something like that.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.600]   For our essential trouble is that our whole view of life in this world is wrong.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:30.000]   What is it? Well, we forget that it's a temporary existence, a temporary life.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.800]   It's a very frail kind of existence, typified by a tent,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.000]   not a solid building with deep foundations and great massive walls.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.600]   No, no, a tent, a frail structure, set up for a moment,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.000]   liable to be blown over by the billows, by the hurricane.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.600]   A frail existence, a temporary existence.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.400]   Oh, there's a great phrase in the thirteenth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.800]   that puts it all so perfectly.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   And if I had one word which I would put before men and women today,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   before everything else, here it is, "Here have we no continuing city."
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   Mankind is living today as if this is the only world, and as if it's a permanent existence.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.400]   And the great idea today is to settle down in this world, isn't it?
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.600]   Security, that's what we're all after.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.800]   That's why we preach about bombs instead of about God.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   Security, we want to stay here, you see.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.200]   In America, prosperity. Yes, they're interested in religion.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.800]   Why? I sometimes think it's because they don't want to lose their prosperity.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.200]   This world, anything that will help us to maintain what we've got,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:01.400]   settle down, permanent security.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:07.600]   And the answer is the feast of tabernacles, tents.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.200]   "Here have we no continuing city."
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.800]   But mankind is fooled by its own works.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.000]   We live in big cities and it all seems so solid.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.200]   It's all here and round and about us.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.400]   And we feel we're going to stay here forever, but we're not.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.600]   We're not.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   And the first object of the feast of tabernacles was to remind these people
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.200]   that you can't settle down in this world.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.400]   It's only temporary.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.200]   We are here today, we are gone tomorrow.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   We're all journeymen, we're sojourners, pilgrims and strangers.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.400]   You know, this is the message of the whole book.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.000]   This is the great fundamental theme of the Bible.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.200]   And it comes to mankind tonight and it says the same thing.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.600]   You with your plans and your state schemes and your welfare state,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.800]   you who are settling down and killing germs and conquering diseases
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.600]   and who think you're going to live forever.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.400]   Yes, I know, the age of death is going up and up
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   and mankind is laughing at it all.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   We are settling down. No, no, you're not.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:28.200]   In spite of all your provisions and all your precautions,
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.600]   you're living in a temporary world and it's an uncertain world.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:43.200]   It's a journey, my dear friend, and nightly pitch my moving tent.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:50.600]   A day's march nearer home.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:56.800]   I make no apology, therefore, this evening of calling your attention to this.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.200]   The first question for every one of us is
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.800]   not whether we should put to death somebody who's got some lethal disease,
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.600]   not whether a man who commits a murder should be put to death.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:15.200]   The question for us is this, have we thought about our own death?
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.000]   How easy it is to argue about these other things.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.800]   Should a man's life be taken?
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.400]   Should life be taken by a doctor?
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   Should life be taken by the state?
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   And you see, while you're arguing about those,
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:32.400]   you've never faced this question that your life is on a very short lease.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:41.800]   Pilgrims and strangers, travellers, moving tent.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:48.600]   It would be a very good thing for us, wouldn't it, to observe the Feast of Tabernacles
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.400]   and just to remind ourselves that though we are so clever, so wonderful,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.000]   and of earnest nature and have conquered so many diseases,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:10.600]   that still, the fact is about every one of us that we are here today and gone tomorrow.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.000]   Here have we no continuing city.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.400]   The summons is bound to come more soon or late to every one of us.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.000]   And the summons will be this, move on.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.600]   Strike your tent. Come along.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   Or as our Lord put it, you remember in that parable of the rich fool,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   who was there congratulating himself on his affluence and prosperity
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.000]   and his phenomenal success, which was so great that he was embarrassed,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.800]   and talks about pulling down his barns and building greater,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   and says to himself, "So, thou hast much good laid up for many years.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:56.600]   Take thy knees, eat, drink, and be merry." But God said unto him, "Thou fool,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:05.000]   this night thy soul shall be required of thee."
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.200]   You are living in a tent, my friend. You are living in a tabernacle.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:18.400]   Don't be misled by the social schemes and social security and economic and financial security.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:25.800]   Don't be misled by it, by the solidity of buildings, the solidity of cities.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:33.200]   It's a brief and a passing life that we're all in.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:39.000]   And the object of this teaching is to make us face that, to realize it,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.600]   to remind us that we are men and women on a journey.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.600]   And we've got to go on. We can't step out. We can't contract out.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.000]   We can't move back. It's going on and on and on.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.800]   We are journeymen, and we are moving in the direction of an end, a death, a finality.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   That's the first thing. But let me hurry on.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.000]   The second object, clearly, of this feast of tabernacles was to remind men and women
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.400]   of their relationship to God.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   "That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths,
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   when I brought them out to the land of Egypt. I am the Lord, your God."
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.800]   Relationship to God.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.200]   Isn't this the thing that we need to be reminded of?
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   The moment we realize our smallness, our frailty, and the precarious nature of the life which we live,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:05.800]   we then begin to think of our relationship to God, the one who commended the feast,
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   the one who gave the detailed instructions as to how it should be kept.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.200]   My dear friend, my business here is not to give my opinions on current affairs
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.000]   or on these topical matters about which people get so excited.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.600]   It is to ask you this question, "Do you know your relationship to God?"
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:38.400]   That's the thing that matters. Your opinions and mine on a thousand and one questions
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.200]   are trivialities that don't matter.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.800]   But here is a question on which your whole eternal destiny is going to suspend,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.000]   your relationship to God.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.400]   And he has given us clear instruction about this in the feast of tabernacles.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.200]   Do you remember how he told them to observe it? Here it is.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:08.400]   "On the first day shall be an holy convocation.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:16.400]   Ye shall do no servile work therein."
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:24.200]   Everybody needs this instruction, Christians as well as non-Christians.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.800]   You know, all our religious conferences come to nothing. I'll tell you why.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.400]   We never start them with a holy convocation.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   We have a form of prayer, of course. We have an introductory devotional service.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   But we rush on to the business.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:47.000]   God commended these people to give a whole day to a holy convocation.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.600]   Everything else was to be set aside. No servile work was to be done.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:05.800]   And he's still teaching us that. One day in seven is meant to be a holy convocation, my friend.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.000]   God has ordained that from the very beginning and it's in force at this moment.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.800]   I don't care so much which day you observe, but I do, I am concerned about one day in seven,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:25.200]   a holy convocation. No servile work, giving it up to God and to his worship and to his praise.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   No, no, not just rushing to a morning service and then going to play your polo or whatever it is.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:40.000]   No, no, giving the whole day to him. To God.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.200]   Not as a polite Christian attending a morning service and then spending the rest of the day
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   in keeping your correspondence up to date and writing to your children at the boarding school.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.600]   No, no, giving the whole day to God in worship, morning and evening.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:02.000]   Christian people, is it surprising the Church is not being blessed?
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   When we are content with just giving God a portion of our time, he wants a whole day.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.800]   A first day shall be a holy convocation unto the Lord.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:24.200]   And what's it to be, how's it to be used, what's to be done? Well, in worship.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:30.800]   God is to be worshipped because he is God. Because he is who and what he is.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.200]   He says, "I am the Lord your God."
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   The business of the feast was to remind men and women that God has made them and not they themselves.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:51.800]   That we are all the products of his work and activity.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.200]   That all we have and hold are under his hands.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   Life, being, existence, health, strength, food, clothing, shelter, it all comes from him.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.000]   He is over all and above all. He is God, he is the only God.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   And he is over all. And there is but one attitude that is worthy in his presence and that is worship.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.200]   Bowing before him, worshipping him, acknowledging him, holy convocation.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.000]   And then you notice the details about sacrifices.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.800]   Seven days he shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   And then again a holy convocation on the eighth day.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.200]   And he shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.600]   It is a solemn assembly. He shall do no servile work therein.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.400]   What is the meaning of these sacrifices?
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.200]   Oh, it is quite simple.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:59.400]   This is a way in which they acknowledge God and his holy laws.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.000]   For God gave mankind laws by which they should live.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.400]   He gave a law originally to men in Adam.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.200]   He gave it explicitly through Moses to these children of Israel
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.000]   in the Ten Commandments and the moral law and all that accompanied it.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   This is God's law.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.400]   And he has even given laws as to how he should be worshipped and how he should be prayed.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:30.400]   And a part of this ceremonial, you see, was designed to make people realize
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.000]   that they are to acknowledge God and his holy laws.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.600]   I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not worship any gods beside me.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.800]   Thou shalt not bow down to any graven image.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.200]   Isn't this what the world needs?
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   Men and women are bowing down to their own graven images.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.000]   They are taking the name of God in vain.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.400]   They have made themselves their own gods, their own country, their own political party,
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.600]   their wealth, their position, their children, their possessions.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.000]   They are worshipping their own gods.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.600]   And here God is calling us back
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.400]   to worship him and to acknowledge him alone
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   and to humble ourselves under his most holy laws.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.400]   Thou shalt not kill.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.200]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.600]   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife or ox or ass or servant.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.200]   Men and women, isn't this the thing the world needs to be hearing?
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.800]   Look at our moral muddle. Look at our problems.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   Rapidly developing, multiplying week by week,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.000]   the chaos that surrounds us and what is needed.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   I say it isn't a mere discussion of particular problems. It's this.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   It is because men and women have lost the consciousness of God
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.400]   and have become lawless and are living to themselves
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.600]   and making their own laws and playing fast and loose,
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.400]   even with the gift of life that God has given us
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.000]   and saying that you can kill a person if it's going to relieve pain and suffering.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   That's why things are as they are.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   No respect for life which is given by God
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.200]   and can only be taken back by God.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.000]   Burnt offerings and sacrifices.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.400]   Man has sinned against God
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   and in his offerings he acknowledges it and he confesses it.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   And he takes his propitiatory offering,
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.600]   he takes the animal and kills him and takes the blood
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.000]   and he offers it to God. It is an appeasement.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.400]   It is asking God to be merciful and to have pity and to have compassion.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.200]   God ordered it.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:00.000]   Holy convocation, worship, sacrifices.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.200]   And then praise.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.400]   Praise to the God of the harvest.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.200]   If we've gathered in our harvest and put it into our barns,
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   who do we thank for it?
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.000]   Do we thank modern science with its new fertilizers
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.200]   and its artificial manures?
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.600]   Do we thank man who can even produce artificial rain?
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   Well, you may if you like and it'll lead to disaster.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.200]   But we should thank God,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.800]   If he were to withhold the sunshine and the rain,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.200]   we'd all be starving.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.800]   And he controls it all.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.600]   It is of his goodness that we are not already consumed.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:52.000]   God is the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.600]   It is from his gracious hands that everything comes.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.800]   The children of Israel had to spend seven days in tabernacles
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.400]   in order to remember this kind of thing.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.600]   My friend, this is the teaching still for us.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.200]   Is your life lived under God?
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.600]   Do you worship him?
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   Is he supreme in your life?
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.000]   Are you living and keeping his holy laws?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.400]   Are you praising him?
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.000]   When did you last thank him out of a full heart?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Do you thank him day by day
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.800]   for the health and strength you've got
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   and which he could take away like that from you?
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   For your preservation and all these things.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.000]   Oh, how we need to be brought back
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.800]   to the teaching of the feast of tabernacles.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.000]   In other words, you see, it comes to this.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.800]   In the tents and in the ceremonial,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.000]   they are really being brought to realize
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.200]   their utter, absolute dependence upon God.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   A word in the book of Deuteronomy tells us
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.000]   that God did all these things to them
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.800]   in order that he might impress this upon their minds
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.000]   that man does not live by bread alone
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.200]   but by every word that proceedeth
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:16.000]   out of the mouth of God.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.800]   We are traveling through a wilderness
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:25.200]   and nothing is so vitally important and urgent for us
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   as that we should realize our dependence upon God.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.800]   Forget your insurances.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.400]   Forget your plans and schemes.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.600]   They won't save you.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.000]   They won't save you from death.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.600]   They won't save you from judgment.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   They won't save you from meeting God.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.200]   Here I say we are called to realize this,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.800]   that we are utterly, absolutely dependent,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.600]   finally, upon God.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   He is the giver of every gift to man,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   of every genius, every ability,
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   every power, every discovery.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.400]   They are but discoveries of the things
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.000]   God has put into nature.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.800]   We call them the laws of nature,
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.400]   but they are not.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.000]   They are the laws of God,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   and they are all for the good and the benefit of man.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.400]   We are dependent upon him.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.600]   Let us acknowledge it.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.800]   Let us thank him for it.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:19.200]   But let me hurry to the third and the last thing.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.800]   The Feast of Tabernacles is to remind us
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.000]   about the nature of life in this world,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.800]   about our relationship to God, yes,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.000]   and above everything to remind us
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   of what God has done for man.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   That you, our generations, may know
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.800]   that I made the children of Israel
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   to dwell in booths when?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.400]   When I brought them out of the land of Egypt.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   Here it is.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.000]   Look at it, first of all,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.200]   in the case of the children of Israel.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.600]   Why did God make them dwell in booths?
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.000]   Why did he ordain the Feast of Tabernacles?
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.800]   Oh, it was to remind them forever
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   of what he did for them.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.000]   What did he do for them?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.400]   Well, there they were in Egypt,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.200]   in the bondage and the cruel slavery,
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.600]   with the taskmasters and their whips,
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.000]   shouting for more bricks,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.600]   giving them less straw to make them.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.400]   The agony of Egypt,
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.600]   the slavery, the suffering,
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.000]   the attempt to destroy their children
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.800]   and their own utter, absolute helplessness.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   The slaves of Pharaoh and his hosts
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   and all his organization,
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.200]   this little people.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.400]   Oh, the hopelessness, the tragedy,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.000]   the helplessness of it all.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.200]   And what happened?
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.000]   God looked down from heaven upon it all
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.600]   and saw the tragedy and the shame and the agony.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   And as it is put in the book of Exodus,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.200]   he came down amongst them.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.400]   He sent down a deliverer.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.000]   He raised up Moses, you remember.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.400]   He did it all from beginning to end.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.600]   It was God's action.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.800]   He planned it all.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   What did he plan?
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.200]   Well, he planned a way of escape for them.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.000]   He and he alone did it,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   from beginning to end.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.800]   He made a way whereby they should escape
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   out of the hands of the Egyptians.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   He delivered them from the oppression
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.600]   and the cruel, terrible tyranny.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.400]   He gave them detailed instructions
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   how to do it all.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.800]   He sent the plagues upon the Egyptians
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.600]   and especially the terrible night
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   when he slew the firstborn of all the Egyptians
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.400]   but saved the Israelites
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.600]   whom he had instructed to put blood upon
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.000]   the doorposts and the lintel.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.800]   The Passover and the marvelous escape,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   you remember,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.600]   and the coming to the Red Sea
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.800]   and the escape and the drowning of Pharaoh's hosts
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   and the landing on the other side.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   Delivered from their enemies,
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   set free from their captors,
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.400]   obstacles overcome,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.000]   leading them through the wilderness,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.800]   feeding them with manna,
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.000]   and on and on and on,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.800]   and ultimately to bring them
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   to the promised land of Canaan,
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.200]   a land flowing with milk and honey,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.000]   the haven of refuge,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   the land for their possession.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.400]   God had done it all of his grace
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   and by his own power and wonderful actions.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.200]   So he calls Moses to him
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.200]   and gives him these instructions.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:08.600]   "See to it," he said, "that every seventh month, every year,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.000]   these children of Israel should live in booths
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.600]   and observe the Feast of Tabernacles,
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.600]   that they might ever remember what I did for their fathers
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   when I brought them out with a mighty hand,
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   delivered them from all their oppressors
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   and took them into the land of promise."
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.600]   I imagine that our blessed Lord and Savior
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.000]   outlined in his own divine manner
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.400]   some such teaching as that.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.000]   But I am very certain that he didn't stop at that.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   As later on when he took up the ceremonial of the pouring of the water
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.600]   from the Pool of Siloam upon the altar,
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   he applied it to himself and said,
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.600]   I am the Pool of Siloam.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   I am the rock that was in the wilderness,"
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   as he did all that.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   I am certain that at this point
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   he also applied all this teaching to himself.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   All these things are but types.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   These are written, as Paul puts it to the Corinthians,
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   "For our instruction, examples and samples,
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   these are the shadows pointing to the substance."
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   And the substance is Christ.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.200]   He was the rock in the wilderness.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   He is everything.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.600]   He is the fulfillment of all the types,
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.200]   the great, the eternal, anti-type of God,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   He is the everything of God.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   So I can put it to you like this.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   This Feast of Tabernacles tells us about Him.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   What does it tell us about Him?
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   Oh, John tells us in the first chapter,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   in the prologue of this Gospel of his
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   which we are considering in chapter 7,
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   the Word, he says, was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   But that is a bad translation.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   This is the right translation.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   The Word was made flesh and tabernacled among us.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   Do you know why we are in this chapel tonight?
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   I will tell you.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   It is because the Lord of glory, the Son of God,
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   left heaven and its glory and its security and its eternity
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   and came on earth and dwelt in a tent of flesh,
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   tabernacled among us,
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   took up His temporary abode in this world
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   came down into the wilderness, the chaos of life,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   to men and women whom He had seen from the glory,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   in the bondage and the shackles
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   and the captivity of sin and Satan.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   He came down and tabernacled among us
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   because He saw people like you and me,
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   slaves of the world and the flesh and the devil,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   slaves as much as the Israelites were in Egypt,
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   with the taskmasters and the whips and the scorpions
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   and all the agony and the cruelty of it all.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   He looked down from the ramparts of heaven and He saw us
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   and He came down amongst us.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   He came into this wilderness which we call life
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   and He dwelt in that frail tent.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   He took His place amongst us.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   He lived the kind of life we live.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   He was dependent upon His Father
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   with all the surrounding insecurity.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   He came, He tabernacled among us.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   And why did He do it?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   Oh, it was because He came to do for us
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   something infinitely bigger and greater
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   than that that was done for the children of Israel
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   in their captivity and bondage in Egypt.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   He came and tabernacled among us
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   in order that He might deliver us
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.200]   from the bondage of sin.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   He came to deliver us from the accusations of the law,
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   the ten commandments, the moral law,
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   the holiness of God.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   We are all condemned by it.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   We are all together in sin, Jews and Gentiles.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   And we could do nothing about it.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   Condemned under the law,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   the slaves of lusts and passions
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   and evil desires and sins.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   And we could do nothing.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   Try as we will, we cannot free ourselves.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   Take your new resolutions,
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   exercise an iron will,
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   but still you fail.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.200]   There we are in bondage
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   and under utter condemnation.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   And we cannot set ourselves free.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   Civilization cannot free us.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   Politics cannot free us.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   Teaching, learning, philosophy, education, religion
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   cannot free us.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   There is only one who can.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   And blessed be his name.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   He did.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   The Word was made flesh
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   and tabernacled among us.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   And he took our burdens and sins and problems
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   upon himself.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   He conquered the devil, our archenemy,
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   in his earthly life.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   He rendered a perfect obedience to God's law.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   And then, he made a sacrifice of himself.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   Sacrifices, yes.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.200]   Here is the sacrifice.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   He made his soul an offering for sin.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   For his own self,
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   bear our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   that we, being dead to sins,
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   should live unto righteousness.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   He died that we might be delivered
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   from the Egypt of our sinfulness,
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   our condemnation under the law.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   And he reconciles us to God.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.200]   And he leads us through the wilderness,
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   giving us the heavenly manna.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   Every supply we need, he gives.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.200]   And at the end,
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   he will take us by the hand
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   and introduce us into the heavenly Canaan
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   of our everlasting home.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.200]   He will present us faultless
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   before the presence of God's glory
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   with exceeding joy.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   The liberation,
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   the reconciliation,
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   the blessed hope
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   that can never fade away.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.200]   My dear friend,
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   have you realized the meaning
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   of the Feast of Tabernacles?
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   That is what he taught
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   in the temple there at Jerusalem.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   Have you heard his message?
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   Have you realized the nature of the life
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.200]   you are living in this world?
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   Had you realized before
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   that your tent is moving hourly
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   nearer this end and this judgment?
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   Had you realized that the Son of God
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   so loved you
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   that he left eternal bliss and glory
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   and tabernacled in this world
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   that you might be delivered
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   and might be saved?
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   Forget everything else.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   What else matters?
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   Save that you should be reconciled to God
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   and be saved eternally.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.200]   Amen.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   We do hope that you've been helped
