[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's a machine, it was my friend Daniel Beauchamp and I,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   we had this long running joke about a proud parent machine
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.480]   that you could give a quarter
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.720]   and it pats you on the shoulder and says, "Proud of you."
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.160]   So yeah, I still have that hanging on my wall
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.520]   in my workshop.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.600]   So that one I'm really happy with.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.120]   I just think it's a really funny concept
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.640]   and also I executed the build well.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.360]   - So it's an arm?
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.240]   Like what's the build?
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.500]   - I built it off of an old lamp arm.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.160]   Yeah, basically it's just a motorized arm
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.960]   and this kind of torso of a person.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.800]   - What's this?
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.840]   So it's actually a hand, right?
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.360]   - It's just laser cut plywood and it kind of has like,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.000]   it looks creepy.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.880]   And yeah, it says, "Proud of you, son."
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.680]   Because I just thought that sounded more funny
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.960]   than proud of you daughter and also proud of you son,
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.360]   just it immediately communicates that it's a parent.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.280]   It's not just like a colleague or something.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.440]   It's like proud of you.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.600]   (laughing)
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.440]   - Yeah.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.640]   - And charges you a quarter for it.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.540]   - Yeah, but he added like chat GPT on top of that
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.600]   and fine tune it on conversations you've had
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.680]   with your parents and all of a sudden you have a thing
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.920]   that can fundamentally transform your psyche.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.760]   - Yeah.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.660]   - The following is a conversation with Simone Yetch,
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.620]   an inventor, designer, engineer, and roboticist
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.780]   famous for a combination of humor
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.080]   and brilliant creative design in the systems
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.620]   and products she creates,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.280]   including as part of her new product design company
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.020]   called Yetch.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.620]   She has a popular YouTube channel
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.220]   where she has demonstrated a lot of her
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.640]   incredible and fun designs and inventions
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.740]   from quote, "Shitty robots" to a Tesla Model 3
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.760]   converted into a truck.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.740]   But where she also revealed her personal journey
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.780]   after having been diagnosed with a brain tumor.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.780]   Simone is a brilliant, fun, and inspiring human being.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.820]   It was truly an honor for me to get to meet her
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.940]   and to have this chat.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.600]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.660]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.860]   in the description.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.420]   And now, dear friends, here's Simone Yetch.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.880]   What was the first cool thing you built
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.280]   where you fell in love with the process of making stuff?
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.900]   - You know, I think in the beginning of building stuff,
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.920]   you run into the limitations of your skills so much.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.480]   So I feel like honestly building gets less and less
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.600]   frustrating or like I love it more and more
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.760]   the more I know.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.600]   - So the limitations aren't fun?
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.440]   Like when it's really frustrating?
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.720]   - The limitations are fun, but it's like
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.440]   when you have an idea of something
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.840]   and you wanna make it a certain level
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.480]   and then you just have to compromise
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.320]   with the materials and the tools and the skills you have.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.600]   So I can't remember first time where I felt like--
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.440]   - I'm proud of this.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.920]   - Wow, this was so smooth.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.360]   I'm so proud of it.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.920]   Like I feel like a lot of people,
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.200]   I watch them build stuff and it's just like
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.300]   watching water pour down, you know?
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.480]   It's just like so easy and for me it's just like
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.800]   trying to shove a toy car into a wall.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.440]   - So you're not able to step back and marvel
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.540]   like at the early creations, even like,
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.160]   even like, we're not even talking the Arduino stuff
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.400]   even before then.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.000]   - I'm from Sweden and you have to choose
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.480]   either sewing or woodworking and I chose
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.400]   like woodworking in middle school.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.680]   And I remember the sense of pride
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.280]   when I got to bring something home
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.600]   and that thing of like, oh my God,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680]   I get to show my parents this.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.160]   And I think that is kind of the feeling
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.120]   that I've built my job around.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.840]   It's like the sense of pride and wanting to show people
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.360]   something that I made and back then it was like
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.960]   a little wooden spoon, you know?
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.760]   And now it's a slightly larger wooden spoon.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.260]   - Wooden spoon that is dynamic and moves
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.080]   and has a mind of its own.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.440]   You first started doing more engineering type stuff
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.360]   with Arduino boards at Punch-through Design,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.320]   which is an SF engineering firm.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.720]   What are, just from your memory there,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.740]   what are some cool things you built there?
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.840]   - So the thing is I went to advertising school
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.780]   and I just like vocational studies a year
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.120]   and I realized there that I didn't care much
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.120]   for advertising, but I thought it was really fun
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.320]   to build stuff and programs.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.200]   So like, I just completely focused on that
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.120]   and there I built my first hardware project
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.960]   or like electronics project, which was this iPhone case
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.920]   with retractable guitar strings.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.720]   So basically I imagined that you could like
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.320]   pull out guitar strings from the bottom of your iPhone
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.700]   and you could pluck it to your belt
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.120]   and then you could hold a cord on the screen.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.880]   And I built that together with my friend Jonathan
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.800]   and I was like, oh, this is dope.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.480]   I thought it was so much fun.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.300]   And I considered like, oh, should I go to school for this?
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.100]   But then I thought, maybe I can get a job
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.220]   and I could get paid to learn about electronics.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.660]   So just based off of that one project,
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.780]   I got the job at Punch Through Design,
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.180]   which actually was a one year internship.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.740]   - Can you explain what we're talking about here?
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.700]   So it's a case with guitar strings attached to it.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.060]   Does it actually work at all?
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.020]   - It does.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.180]   - These are not on the screen guitar strings.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.020]   - No.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.700]   So they're actual strings that you pull out.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.220]   So there's a mechanism that's almost
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.980]   like a seatbelt mechanism.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.980]   And yeah, you pull them out from the bottom of your phone
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.940]   and you can attach them to your belt.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.540]   I mean, it's terrible.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.940]   There's a few different ways to decide
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.660]   if somebody is touching a guitar string.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.340]   And what you do in a real guitar is you have the little,
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.260]   it's like measuring the vibration or the change in the,
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.300]   as the, yeah, you're measuring how the guitar is vibrating.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.620]   And you can't really do that because I can't have
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.540]   a receiving sensor because the guitar strings
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.420]   are gonna move in relationship to that
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.500]   because you don't have like a rigid neck.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.460]   And this is like, yeah,
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.800]   this was my first electronics project.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.760]   I was a little fledging baby maker.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.180]   But what I decided was to use capacitive touch
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.180]   'cause that is independent on if the guitar strings
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.260]   are moving in relationship to something
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.740]   or in relation to something.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.900]   So basically there was just this little Bluetooth
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.100]   Arduino board that this company Punch Through Design made.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.660]   So that was how I found them.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.020]   And I measured the capacitive touch.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.840]   So like whenever the guitar string was measured,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.020]   there was this little microcontroller that was like,
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.060]   oh my God, a guitar string got measured or touched.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.060]   And then that sent a signal over Bluetooth to my phone.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.300]   And I'd built a little iPhone app that interpreted
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.500]   those Bluetooth signals and then checked
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.380]   what type of chord I was holding on the screen
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.220]   and then play the chord here.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.460]   - So you're holding the chords on the screen.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.180]   So you're doing the multi-touch sensing there.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.980]   That's incredible.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.540]   - I honestly cannot believe that I pulled it off
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.860]   because I think I was, ignorance was definitely bliss
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.900]   because that was like, yeah,
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.140]   the first hardware project I'd ever built,
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.780]   the first iPhone app I'd ever programmed.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.620]   And like now if somebody was like,
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.420]   hey, I want this to be my first project,
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.060]   I would probably be like, oh, that's a lot.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.820]   But I pulled it off.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.300]   - Because that's such an interesting thing
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.500]   for people to hear because it's your first project.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.900]   And a lot of people stop because of the difficulty
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.940]   of their first project.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.780]   They never truly discovered their own genius
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.320]   because they stopped at the first and you didn't stop.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.060]   So it'd be interesting to kind of psychoanalyze you
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.220]   on the couch of why you didn't stop.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.260]   'Cause you have to build an app to figure out how to,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.580]   did you know how to program much or no?
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.420]   - Okay.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.420]   - I mean, a little bit, but I'd never programmed
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.060]   or done any iOS apps.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.780]   - Okay, so you have to figure out how to get,
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.020]   forget like what the app does,
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.460]   just get the app running and working.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.380]   And then you have to figure out how to get the sensors
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.100]   in like real time, the finger touching,
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.260]   and you have to connect how to get the capacitors
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.460]   touch working with the microcontrollers.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.220]   Do you know anything about the capacitor touch sensors
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.060]   at that time?
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.820]   - I mean, it's pretty easy now.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.660]   It's basically just--
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.980]   - Everything's easy.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.780]   - You know, rockets are pretty easy.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.180]   - Hey, you sound like my grandma.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.340]   She's, I have an Italian grandma
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.980]   and I always trying to get her,
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.980]   we're like trying to get her to tell her recipes
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.460]   and every recipe starts with, it's very simple.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.420]   And then there's like 45 minutes of her explaining it.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.820]   - It's like with gymnastics at the Olympics,
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.860]   they make it look easy.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.300]   The best people in the world always make
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.420]   the impossible seem easy.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.100]   - I pride myself with making buildings look really hard
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.500]   'cause I feel like I'm always struggling so much.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.180]   - You make the easiest thing possible.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.860]   No, so how many strings was it?
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.700]   Or is it just one?
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.340]   - Oh gosh, I mean, this is such a long time ago.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.340]   No, it was six.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.100]   - Oh, six strings and you can touch it
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.620]   and then there's, wow.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.740]   And it can, and then the phone itself makes a sound?
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.020]   - Uh-huh.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.940]   And I still think it's such a cool concept
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.540]   to have this like mobile,
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.580]   I'm not even a guitar player, I don't know.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.740]   I was, I mean, I got the idea because I was kind of
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.820]   strumming on my charge cord of my phone.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.460]   - Oh, like an air guitar but on a cord?
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.540]   - Yeah, but I've been thinking about it 'cause I'm like,
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   oh man, it would be really fun to go back to that project
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.180]   with what I know now.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.020]   But the problem with it is that
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.460]   when you're producing the tension in your string
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.140]   just with your arm, like you can't make it taut enough
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.460]   to actually play, like it kind of becomes
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.020]   playing these like saggy strings.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.580]   So it's, you're not really getting that experience
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.780]   and I think that's why, I mean, I,
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.140]   yeah, I haven't really pursued it.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.300]   - I wonder if there's a way to generate the tightness
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.060]   from the case itself.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.140]   Like a device that unfolds and then
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.780]   with some kind of tightening mechanisms tightens.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.660]   - Yeah, but then it kind of becomes this like
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.260]   whole thing in a guitar,
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.580]   then it just becomes a really shitty guitar.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.060]   Like, which this is a really shitty guitar
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.900]   but it's also not a guitar.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.100]   - But it's so shitty, it's awesome.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.340]   - But it's cool that you have an interface between
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.940]   a device that's capable of incredible computational power
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.460]   and an actual hardware thing.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.300]   Is there something that you can psychoanalyze
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.540]   that made you finish that others could hear
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.900]   in their own struggle to do their first project like that?
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.420]   Because you were in a non-engineering person, technically.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.180]   And you did a pretty cool, renegade, out there,
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.260]   wild, no instructions engineering project.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.940]   - No, it's definitely was an off-road build
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.620]   where it's like if you're building a Lego kit,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.580]   it's very much on the road and you're following instructions
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.740]   and this is like, you have no idea if you're headed
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.420]   for a cliff or a dead end or you're gonna get stuck.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.500]   I think it had a natural pressure to it
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.060]   because it was a school project.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.900]   - Yeah.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.140]   - So it did have deadlines built into it
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.100]   and stuff like that, so that definitely helped.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.300]   But I think also it was just so incredibly motivating
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.340]   when I realized that I might be able to pull it off.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.220]   Like that was, I felt like a bloodhound, you know?
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.200]   You're just like, oh my God,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.540]   I can actually make this happen.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.540]   And I think if I hadn't seen that, the horizon,
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.260]   it would have been harder to stick through.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.460]   - Were you able to see the end of the tunnel
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.780]   pretty early on?
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.780]   - No, not really.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.020]   (laughing)
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.740]   - So there's something to just suffering for a while.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.660]   - I don't know how your brain works,
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.320]   but it's like if I have a problem,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.820]   I can't stop thinking about it.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.340]   Like it's so fun to think about it.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.340]   Like I spent two and a half years designing a coat hanger
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:58.700]   and I just can't stop thinking about it.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.580]   Like I get so into it 'cause I think it's so much fun.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.540]   - Take me to this two year journey of the coat hanger.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.860]   - Of the coat hanger.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.820]   - What, how did it begin?
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.660]   - How did it begin?
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.040]   It began with a corner in my home
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.020]   where I couldn't fit a coat rack.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.500]   The thing is I shouldn't have brought this up
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.020]   because I'm gonna release it as a product
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.180]   probably in a year.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.860]   - On an actual product?
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.380]   Okay, well, that's a mystery.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.220]   - It's a mystery, yeah.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.620]   - But it solves a fundamental problem
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.420]   in the human condition.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.500]   - And I am so excited about it and I cannot,
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.180]   I don't, yeah, but this is, I get so pumped about it
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.700]   because I see it's just this issue
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.300]   or like this problem that I wanna solve
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.100]   and I kinda can't put it to rest until I have.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.000]   - I mean, speaking of coat hangers,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.340]   doorknobs have always been interesting to me.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.380]   It's cool how there's things that everybody uses
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.140]   that somebody designed.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.500]   - Lex. - Yeah.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.700]   - Oh my God, so okay, so this is,
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.500]   so I have two like big,
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.260]   so basically I started on YouTube
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.700]   and I've been doing that for like the last seven
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.700]   or eight years and I've kind of been thinking of like,
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.220]   okay, what's next for me?
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.660]   'Cause I wanna keep on trying out new things
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.600]   and I'm kind of going into two different avenues.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.020]   One is the product business that I started,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.360]   Coat Hangers TBD,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.640]   and then I am working on a pilot episode of a show
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.780]   where each episode is about an everyday object
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.440]   and why they look the way that they do.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.120]   So we've written a pilot episode about forks
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.500]   and it's all about like,
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.480]   why do they look the way that they do?
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.160]   Why did this became the like eating implement of the West?
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.480]   Why are we ruled by an iron fork?
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.320]   How did that happen?
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.400]   And every everyday object that you have
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.260]   and that you just take for granted,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.720]   somebody just made it up.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.840]   - Yeah, we're all sheep, we all keep using it.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.680]   - Yeah.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.500]   - Even if it's not optimal.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.320]   I mean, presumably most objects are optimal, you hope.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.160]   Or at least a local optimal.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.320]   - Yeah, and that's what I think is so like
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.520]   the world around us,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.160]   and this is why I love building things
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.440]   is because it just opens up this idea
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.760]   that the world around us is so malleable
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.120]   and you can make objects work for you better.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.840]   Like I spent, I made this fruit bowl.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.000]   I had a fruit bowl and I was always annoyed
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.640]   that I had either too little or too much fruit for it.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.360]   So I made a fruit bowl where I can change
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.240]   the diameter of it.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.120]   It has a mechanism so you can like make it bigger or smaller.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.880]   And that's just like the thing of being like bowls.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.600]   Why are they the way that they are?
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.000]   I can make them different.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.680]   And I think like, I want to make an episode about doorknobs.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.840]   I think it's so interesting.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.880]   Why are they the way they are?
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.560]   Why are they placed the way where they are?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.360]   - I think that's going to be a rabbit hole
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.840]   from which you will never return.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.580]   - I would happily live in that rabbit hole forever.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.420]   Like if I can like dig out a little niche for myself there,
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.820]   because I think it's like,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.160]   they go so deep.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.540]   - They're also on different sides of doors.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.500]   You never, like the push pull situation on doors in general,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.860]   like that's one of the main problems of humanity
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.300]   is figuring out the push pull.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.140]   Figuring out which--
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.220]   - It is embarrassing.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.700]   - It's just, okay, how many?
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.020]   There's 8 billion people on earth.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.780]   Every single second, there is millions of people
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.860]   being embarrassed by the confusion
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.500]   of what the push pull. - Real life stats.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.980]   - Right now there's somebody,
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.340]   some guy first time in college,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.260]   he's trying to be impressive to everybody,
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.300]   pushes on a, and he plays it off like it's cool.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.900]   Oh shit, I knew that.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.740]   - No, but that's-- - Over and over.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.140]   - And it affects our behaviors.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.540]   That was why I think it's so interesting with forks
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.820]   is that forks actually affect our eating behaviors.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.180]   And they can get you to eat faster or slower,
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.020]   take bigger bites or smaller bites,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.680]   and there are all these ways, or like the social,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.100]   I mean the reason that chopsticks work
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.860]   is because they do the food chopping in the kitchen
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.500]   rather than on the plate.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.940]   And also you have a bowl that you bring to your mouth
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.660]   whereas a plate you keep on the,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.860]   like there are just all these ways
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.220]   some of these objects affect our behavior,
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.980]   opening and closing doors.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.620]   And I think it's such an interesting take on culture
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.780]   through, and like human behavior through these objects
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.860]   that we use every day and we never question them really.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.460]   - Yeah, and then there's institutions
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.700]   that are controlling our mind
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.700]   that don't want us to know the truth.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.940]   Why are sporks not more popular?
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.180]   Have you asked yourself that question?
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.540]   - Yeah, no, it's all big utensil is behind all of it.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.620]   - Right, so I mean in those early days
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.820]   did you suffer from imposter syndrome?
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.140]   Like that leap to being an engineer,
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:49.100]   was there, especially when you started
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.240]   working a bunch of the design on a team of engineers,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.880]   was there insecurity?
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.500]   - Both yes and no.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   I think I always try to flip my flaws into selling points.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.420]   And for that, so getting that job,
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:12.560]   I was like, oh, you're a team of engineers.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.540]   Everybody working here is an engineer.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.580]   Your customers are not all engineers.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.100]   You need somebody who can be your filter
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.020]   and tell you when something's gonna be too hard
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.660]   for your customers to understand.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.180]   So it was more me being like, oh no,
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.900]   it might seem that me not having skills is a bad thing,
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.580]   but actually it's a great thing.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.420]   I need it.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.580]   - I represent the everyday person.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.740]   I understand deeply what everybody needs and wants.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.640]   - Yes, that is me, the representation of the average human.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.140]   But I mean, I remember that.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.380]   So I studied physics for a year in college
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.860]   and then I dropped out.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.300]   And I had this rule for myself
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.820]   that whenever I did not understand something,
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.740]   I would ask a question.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.940]   So I was always raising my hand in class.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.860]   And it's this room, entire auditorium
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.900]   filled with incredibly intelligent people
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.580]   who are mortified of seeming stupid.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.100]   And I think that was really like,
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.140]   and I remember people at the end of the year
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.620]   coming up to me and being like,
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.420]   thank you so much for all the questions you asked
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.980]   because whenever there was something
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.100]   that I was too scared to ask, you always raised your hand.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.700]   So I think it is a bit of a skill.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.540]   And I think that is kind of how I channel
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.840]   my imposter syndrome is I'm just like,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.900]   no, let's lay it all out there.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.940]   - So you're okay being almost like self-deprecating,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.780]   just coming off.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.740]   - Yeah, I'm definitely that.
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.180]   I kind of lean into call myself an idiot.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.260]   I lean into being stupid.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.940]   I think not all heroes wear capes
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.980]   and the guy and girl who asks the stupid question
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.180]   is everybody's hero, including the teachers.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.980]   - Yeah, I think it's both.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.020]   It's a double-edged sword.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.820]   I started out on the internet.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.020]   I kind of got the moniker, the queen of shitty robots
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.560]   because I posted a lot of stuff
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.740]   on /r/shittyrobots on Reddit.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.700]   And people started calling me the queen of /r/shittyrobots
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.260]   and then the /r kind of dropped.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.300]   So what I'm trying to say is I did not come up
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.900]   with that with myself, but I did happily adopt it.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.360]   So I definitely came from a place of like,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.620]   building things that didn't work and kind of,
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.060]   yeah, everything going wrong every time,
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.020]   like happily failing.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.820]   And I think that was amazing.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.980]   It was a really powerful tool for me
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.620]   to like not get my perfectionism in the way
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.820]   because if I set out to do something that's great,
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.540]   then I'm never gonna start.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.300]   And I was like, no, I just need something that looks funny.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.660]   But what I've realized now
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.580]   is there's also a defense mechanism.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.500]   Being self-deprecating is like
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.820]   always beating people to the punch.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.540]   It kind of was a survival tactic on the internet
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.060]   of being like never daring to set out as an expert.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.140]   And I still do that.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.980]   I'm terrified to tell people how to do something,
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.100]   even if I know,
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.540]   because it kind of opens you up for being shot down.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.920]   So I think I definitely have a conflicted relationship
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.240]   with it and now, especially as I'm getting older,
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.300]   I am more skilled than I was before.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.900]   I mean, I'm a CEO of three businesses and I'm like,
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.460]   I don't need to keep on talking myself down all the time.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.700]   So yeah, I think it's definitely something
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.380]   that has served me really, really well.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.100]   And that is still like a thing that I have in my work life
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.200]   and in my relationships,
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.380]   but I'm also trying to only
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.180]   do it when it's beneficial to me and not when it's harmful.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.720]   - Yeah, I mean, but when you're as successful as you are,
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.580]   I feel like people like it when you're self-deprecating,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.660]   you don't take yourself seriously, you have that humility.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.260]   I think it's probably the hardest when you're starting out.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.100]   - Yeah.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.420]   - 'Cause-- - I don't know.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.900]   I think it was easier than almost, I don't know.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.060]   - But nobody takes you seriously, right?
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.420]   When you're starting out, when you're young.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.380]   - You know, I just realized that I played
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.740]   a lot more stupid than I was.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.740]   And I think it's also,
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.000]   oh gosh, I can't believe I'm the one bringing this up.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.620]   But like being a woman in a male-dominated field
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.700]   and you're like, I was just trying to make myself
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.100]   the least amount threatening or like really unthreatening
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.160]   because people are threatened by you in different ways.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.780]   And it's like, you have such a thin line that you can walk
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.180]   where you're like, okay, I need to be just attractive enough
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.500]   for people to not be offended by my appearance,
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.460]   but just unattractive enough for people to not sexualize me.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.660]   I have to be just smart and witty enough
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.300]   for people to be like, oh my God, that's really cool.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.580]   But also shoot myself down enough for other people
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.660]   not to be able to do it or be like, oh yeah,
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.020]   watch this woman try to thinking that she knows
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.300]   how to build electronics.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   So it's like--
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.940]   - That's an interesting skill to build,
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.540]   especially when you put yourself out there on the internet.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.220]   Unfortunately, that's the reality of the internet
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.500]   and it's a skill you have to kind of develop.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.420]   And it's actually why a lot of really brilliant people
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.420]   avoid the internet.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.300]   There's not many people, like at MIT, for example,
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.780]   there's not many brilliant professors or PhD students
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.940]   and so on just putting their stuff out there
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.940]   because if they really put their heart and soul
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.940]   into a thing, first of all, it's really hard
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.340]   and nobody sees it and everyone's like, eh, this is boring.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.100]   So there's so many failure modes, like this is boring,
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.700]   or like you said, you're coming off as too much of an expert,
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.300]   you're not self-deprecating enough,
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.900]   but there's just so many failure modes
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.260]   and it's terrifying for people.
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.900]   But I feel like that's a skill you should learn
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.900]   because most people, like at MIT, at university and so on,
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.460]   are doing a lot of awesome stuff.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.940]   And you should show it off.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.500]   But I feel like you figured out a really good process
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.780]   of showing it off, when you fail, when you succeed,
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.060]   all of it, not taking yourself too seriously,
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.460]   but also revealing through the humor
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.020]   and the self-deprecation a kind of genius,
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.940]   a kind of intelligence and curiosity.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.020]   - Yeah, I just wanna snapshot that quote
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.580]   and put it on my LinkedIn profile.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.420]   - On the back of your book.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.240]   - On the back of my book.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.340]   - When is your autobiography coming out?
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.180]   - Oh, never.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.740]   (both laughing)
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.220]   - You don't wanna say that because like a year from now.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.460]   - Oh gosh, I don't wanna shit on autobiographies, no.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.380]   - No, no.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.100]   - Just by saying that, I'm shitting on autobiographies.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.660]   I just, me being interested enough in somebody
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   to wanna read 600 pages about them talking about themselves.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.060]   - Well, that's exactly the kind of person
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   I should write one.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.580]   - But also I'm fucking 32 years old.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.540]   What do I have to write about?
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.020]   Like I went through puberty, I lost my virginity
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.540]   and here we are, like, I don't know.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.780]   It's like such a.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.140]   (both laughing)
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.720]   - Three chapters, it's a coloring book.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:05.020]   - Chapter seven, I learned to tie my own shoelaces.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.140]   - I feel like it would be awesome.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.980]   Anyway, what's the queen,
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.340]   so how did you achieve the status of royalty?
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.260]   The queen of shitty robots, what's the origin story there?
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.420]   - I mean, I have officially renounced my title now.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.180]   - Can you still speak of the time when you led?
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.540]   - I can still speak of the time.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.380]   - Your kingdom?
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.780]   - Yes, no, I mean, it started on, because I.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.460]   - Did you rule by love or fear?
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.260]   - By fear of rejection from me, that people would reject me.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.940]   So I, yeah, I started making these little gifts.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.780]   Like my, the early projects that I did
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.260]   were very gift forward.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.180]   It was always like, I only did it
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.780]   because it could be translated into a gift.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.020]   - Gift forward, I like it.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.540]   - Yeah, but honestly, it was like,
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.500]   it's a really good mental exercise to vet
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.060]   if your project is easy enough to be explained
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.980]   by like a seven second looping video without audio.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.900]   And because like, nobody's gonna care
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.460]   that it also has Bluetooth.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.220]   Like, it's really like, is it self-explanatory enough
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.420]   to be explained through a gift?
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.260]   So yeah.
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.780]   - I can just pause, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.340]   but I feel like all scientific papers and projects
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.740]   should go through that exercise.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.220]   - Can you explain what's a gift?
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.220]   - Yeah, actually, DeepMind does a good job of this.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.780]   Like, you know, we've solved protein folding,
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.140]   here's a gift.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.940]   That's literally what they do.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.100]   Because who's gonna read the nature paper?
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.220]   So like this, you have to,
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.940]   like how do we communicate this visually
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.580]   in a sexy, clean way where people can intuitively
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.820]   understand even if you don't know what a protein is,
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.860]   even if you don't know what protein folding is?
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.700]   Yeah, it's a cool exercise.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.140]   - No, it's very like, yeah,
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.660]   if somebody comes out of context,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.260]   and that's been really interesting also,
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.220]   like building this product business
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.820]   and trying to do the marketing around that.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.820]   And I'm like, if somebody comes in
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.300]   and they have no idea about what this product is,
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.980]   will they get it explained to them in this ad?
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.340]   And I don't know.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.160]   But it's definitely a worthwhile exercise to do.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.500]   So I started making these projects.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.140]   I got translated into GIFs.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.940]   And I posted them on /r/shittyrobots on Reddit.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.580]   - So that's how Reddit existed?
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.100]   - Yeah, and I loved it.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.100]   I thought it was really fun.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.380]   And I was like, I wanna contribute with content here.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.420]   - Conquered it.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.180]   - I don't, I mean, I don't know.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.460]   I was voted-- - Through fear of rejection.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.300]   - I think I was voted top user of 2015.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   So yeah, that's an old merit.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.700]   - Once you win a Nobel Prize,
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.860]   you always have the Nobel Prize.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.900]   (laughing)
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.100]   - Okay, so what was the first,
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.980]   do you remember the early GIFs that you created?
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.980]   - So this is when I was at Punch Through Design
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.100]   in San Francisco.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.060]   I was kind of building a lot of hardware projects for them.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.520]   But I also felt, and they were so supportive of me.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.220]   But I also, it's such a different way
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.740]   representing a brand versus representing yourself.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.500]   So there were some projects that I just like ruled out
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.540]   'cause I was like, this feels too weird for this brand.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.260]   And I started building them on the side.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.180]   One of them was a toothbrush helmet.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.020]   And yeah, so it's like a skateboard helmet
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.360]   with a robot arm on the forehead,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.060]   kind of like a unicorn horn.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.100]   And it brushes your teeth for you.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.020]   - Was that the first YouTube video you uploaded?
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.640]   - It was the first GIF that I uploaded.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.160]   So actually, I wanted to,
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:24.340]   I wanted to do a kid's show about electronics in Sweden
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.020]   'cause I was like, I love electronics.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.660]   I think it's fucking dope.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.180]   I could do a kid's show about it.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:35.180]   So I filmed this terrible, terrible pilot episode
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.700]   in my bedroom in San Francisco.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.100]   And that's when I built the toothbrush helmet.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.060]   And I emailed it to them.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.060]   I mean, just cold email, like no in or anything.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.820]   I was like, hey, I wanna do this.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.700]   And they didn't get back to me.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.060]   Nobody surprised.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.340]   And I was like, well, I have this thing I built.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.740]   I might as well post it on the internet.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.140]   So that's what I made the little GIF
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.060]   and I posted it on /r/shadyrobots.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.380]   I think it got like 50,000 views.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.740]   And I was like, wow.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.420]   And from there, I just kept on building things.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.260]   And I think within six months, it was my full-time job.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.580]   - Can you go through the detailed design
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.820]   of this toothbrush helmet?
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.260]   There's a motor, there's like a server.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.820]   Like what's the motor?
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.660]   What's the, is an Arduino involved?
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.660]   - Yeah, so I built it off of this robot arm called MeArm.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.180]   So it's just this acrylic robot arm.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:35.660]   And I think it has three servo motors.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.300]   And it's all controlled by an Arduino,
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.140]   all the electronics. - So the arm
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.340]   was already pre-built?
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.460]   - It was a kit, so I assembled it.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:46.460]   - How do you make sure the length of the arm is the proper?
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.140]   - I mean, the arm came down.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.100]   So it's like, I mean, I just programmed it
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.980]   to come down to my mouth
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.260]   and then poorly brush my front teeth.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.100]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.740]   - And it was just swung back and forth.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.940]   I mean.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.420]   - Trial and error is how you do that.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.260]   - Trial and error?
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.020]   What was the challenges of that?
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.180]   Do you remember? - Oh gosh.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.820]   - Or was that one not much of a struggle?
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.140]   - No, it was definitely a struggle.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.340]   - 'Cause also, how do you loop it with a nice GIF?
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.940]   - I mean, it loops fine.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.860]   - Yeah, it looks pretty fine.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.700]   - Yeah.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.500]   - That's not that hard?
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.980]   - No, I mean, it doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.460]   It's a GIF, it's the internet.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.220]   Things are shitty all the time.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.860]   I think, I mean, I think the biggest struggle of that
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.380]   was that I had this intention for it to be this show
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.180]   and then them not giving.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.620]   - Oh yeah. - Yeah, giving back.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.260]   And I was like, well, if they don't want it,
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.340]   then maybe YouTube will have me.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.060]   - They don't notice my genius yet.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.900]   What was so bad about the pilot?
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.740]   Do you remember?
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.580]   What was like the most embarrassing?
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.180]   - Oh, it's just so cringy.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.620]   Yeah, I mean, it's thankfully not on the internet,
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.060]   so nobody can find it.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.100]   But it's very much me being in what I called host mode,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.860]   which is where I'm like, okay,
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.380]   so what we're gonna learn today
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.220]   is that we're gonna look at this.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.340]   This is something called a servo motor.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.460]   And it's like the intonation
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.340]   and everything is really different.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.540]   And I'm actually, I mean, thinking back of that,
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.940]   I'm so happy that they didn't get back to me
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.300]   because it's such a different thing
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.940]   to kind of start your career in your living room,
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.380]   running back and forth to the camera
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.540]   and like filming something and then looking at it.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.420]   And like, I got to really find my own voice
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.300]   in a different way.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.780]   And then like a year later, they offered me a show,
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.300]   but then I was so off and running.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.140]   I was like, no, I don't wanna do this.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.020]   - You didn't fall into that place of being like a actor,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.900]   like a YouTuber where you're presenting
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.300]   a kind of personality.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.740]   You're more focused on the product you're creating.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.420]   - I mean, I think it's a combination of it.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.060]   I mean, I think of it as acting sometimes,
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.340]   but I only play the role of myself.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.620]   But of course it's like when you're shooting something
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.620]   for the seventh time,
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.980]   like you have to be able to muster that enthusiasm.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.980]   But no, it's not a kind of think of everyday life me
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.140]   as a watered down version of the YouTube version.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.460]   It's like-
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.940]   - That's a cheap knockoff.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.540]   - Yeah, the push.com version.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:18.020]   No, it's just like add a few parts water and you have me.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.940]   But like on YouTube it's just so condensed
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.940]   'cause you have jump cuts and I'll script jokes
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.620]   and make sure that everything lands
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.900]   and there's music and stuff.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.820]   And then in real life you don't have any of that,
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.820]   but it's still me.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.460]   - What are some other cool robots in the early days
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.780]   that stand out to you?
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.420]   I mean, there's a million we can go through,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.060]   but maybe what was a challenging one,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.500]   like a really challenging one in the early days?
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.020]   - I mean, I remember the breakfast robot,
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.740]   which was my second project was a challenging one.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.260]   - Was it eating cereal?
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.380]   - Yeah, it's a robot that like pours milk and cereal
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.540]   and feeds me with a spoon.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.980]   I was mostly challenging because it was so like,
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.860]   everything had to be in the right location
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.260]   and there were so many takes before I got everything right.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.660]   And by right, I mean, it makes an absolute mess.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.380]   Yeah, that one was challenging.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.220]   - How many takes was that one?
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.300]   - I don't know, probably 12, 10, something.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.500]   - It's a mess everywhere.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.620]   - It's a mess, and also I use like Cheerios for the cereals
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.500]   and it's shot in my old bedroom in San Francisco
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.020]   and the floors were sticky for weeks afterwards.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.180]   - Do you use it to go into your autobiography?
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.260]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.100]   - It's nice.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.420]   - I'm gonna see if I can just type out this podcast
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.900]   and I'll release it as a, my manager would be stoked.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.140]   - We'll fix it in post.
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.220]   Yeah, the feed, 'cause you have like a couple
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.300]   of feeding ones, right?
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.620]   The soup, isn't there a soup one?
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.420]   - Yeah, there's a soup robot.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.620]   There's a beer pouring robot.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.660]   - I mean, that's awesome.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.780]   That's a difficult robotics problem
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.060]   in the shitty and the perfect version
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:02.020]   of having an arm that interacts intimately
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.220]   with a human being.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.020]   And one of the most intimate things you could do
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.260]   with a human being, that's PG, is to feed it.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.420]   - I was like, don't go there.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.500]   - Where's he going with this?
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.580]   - Oh my God, he's a YouTube comment come live.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.420]   (laughs)
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.260]   Like, damn it.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.660]   - To me, feeding is tricky.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.500]   Or even like getting a beer,
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.180]   even pouring a beer is tough until glass.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.060]   - Yeah, it's trickier than anyone
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.780]   who hasn't tried it thinks.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.140]   And even making it, I think what I realized
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.340]   is that making things really shitty
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.260]   or failing in a spectacular way
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.780]   is also its own sort of skill.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.420]   Because the shittiest robot is the one
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.820]   that doesn't turn on.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.260]   But that isn't much to watch.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.780]   So it was always wanting for it to fail
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.700]   in these kind of spectacular ways.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.220]   No, there's a lot of stuff to be said
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.820]   about engineering in it.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.380]   - Is there something to be said on a philosophical level
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.180]   about the value of a flawed robot?
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   So like, the kind of robots you want
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.740]   is to be partially flawed.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.140]   Like, do you think the kind of robots
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.820]   we'll have in the home that are friends
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.340]   and almost like pets,
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.660]   wouldn't they need to be kind of shitty?
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.980]   Because we can love the,
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.260]   somehow we humans love the shitty.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.020]   - I mean, it is kind of endearing
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.140]   'cause I think it kind of,
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.100]   I'm gonna mess up this word,
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.860]   anthropomorphizes them.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.060]   I think it's, I mean, I never feel
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.620]   as deeply connected to my Roomba
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.460]   as when it's like, I'm on a cliff.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.780]   - Have you had Roomba's talk?
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.780]   - No. - I really,
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.180]   yeah, I've done that a lot.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.860]   - Yeah. - When they talk to you.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.820]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.740]   And it immediately anthropomorphizes them.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.660]   - Yeah. - And then you have,
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.660]   if they have a name,
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.700]   which is why most roboticists don't give names
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.140]   or gender to robots,
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.100]   'cause you become connected to them.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.980]   I'm of the opposite mind.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.220]   You should have like an intimate relationship,
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.900]   sounds weird,
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.940]   but you should have a close connection to robots.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.260]   I mean, there's power in that.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.020]   There's a social element to robotics,
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.340]   even an arm.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.140]   I don't know.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.300]   There's something about us humans
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.340]   that gains so much value
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:23.540]   from our interaction with dynamic objects.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.700]   And we should like lean into that
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.060]   as opposed to run away from it.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.140]   That was always the confusing thing to me about robotics
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.500]   is that most roboticists run away from that.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.700]   - Yeah. - It's weird.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.420]   'Cause it's obviously gonna be,
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.780]   robots are obviously going to be everywhere.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.020]   - Yeah. - Obviously.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.580]   - But it's also humans are sensitive and squishy
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.380]   and there's so much liability.
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.060]   - Oh, okay. - Yeah.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.180]   - Yeah, but humans are sensitive and squishy
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.220]   when they interact with each other
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.580]   and they hurt each other all the time.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.580]   Like sometimes they get together
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.740]   and they're like, "Oh, you're the best."
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.780]   No, you're the best.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.180]   And then they leave each other
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.500]   and then they break each other's heart.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.140]   - Sorry about your breakup, Lex.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.980]   I didn't know you were done. - Yeah,
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.820]   I was trying to get over this.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.620]   I'm actually drunk for this interview.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.820]   (both laughing)
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.660]   I haven't been able to sleep for nights.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.500]   - Have you slept all night?
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.220]   - No, not yet.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.140]   But from a safety protocol perspective,
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.460]   people think about physical damage, not emotional damage.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.260]   I know this sounds ridiculous.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.180]   I know this sounds ridiculous, but it won't be.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.620]   It's already happening.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.100]   There's an app called Replica
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.900]   where people have an intimate relationship
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.700]   with an AI chatbot and they hurt themselves.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.940]   - I was thinking about this.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.780]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.780]   In dating, what if you, 'cause you can train
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.100]   like a chatbot to kind of mimic
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.860]   the way that you talk to people and interact with people.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.180]   - Go on. - Yeah.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.060]   But then I'm like, okay,
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.420]   but what if we could all make AI versions of ourselves
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.860]   and have them date like thousands and thousands
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.180]   of other AI people and have that as a way
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.420]   to turn out potential candidates?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.180]   Like, I feel like that's gonna be, what's the, yeah.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.340]   - What's the, what?
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.420]   - No, but what's the point of like meeting 20 people
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.740]   if you're like, oh, but if we just had our AI versions
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.220]   of ourselves interact, they'd be like,
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.220]   oh, your method of conflict is not gonna match or.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.380]   - What if the AI version of you like sleeps around
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.900]   with all the other AIs and becomes famous for that
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.940]   and it starts its own OnlyFans and then it become,
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.420]   and you're like, what did you do?
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.980]   You come back home, you'd realize like,
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.940]   I didn't want to. - I created a monster.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.780]   - Create a monster.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.540]   - I mean, do I get a cut?
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.020]   - Exactly, that's the question I would be asking.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.980]   But I think it's definitely like, yeah,
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:41.580]   the human technology interaction is really interesting
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.660]   because I feel like I don't love any of the machines
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.500]   that I have in my life.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.420]   - Oh, really, you haven't?
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.820]   - I mean, I don't love my phone.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.740]   I touch it all the time and it's there
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.060]   and it's like constantly, it's a constant presence,
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.780]   but there's nothing in me that feels like,
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.580]   oh, I love this object.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.020]   Like I kind of despise it.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.380]   - Well, that might be the way you show love, I don't know.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.580]   - Yeah. - That's a deeper,
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.020]   that's another psychoanalysis thing.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.220]   So there's not robots whom you've taken apart that you miss?
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.700]   - No, they're all terrible.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.320]   I mean, I have objects that I built that I love.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.300]   None of the robots, I think,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.180]   but that's also because that was a different era
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.620]   where I wasn't really putting a lot of care
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.980]   into the projects I built.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.260]   - So the more care you put into the design
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.500]   to actually make it look, to make it functional, look good,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.180]   that's where you put the love in.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.540]   - Yeah, I mean, it is.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.140]   It's like, I feel like any technology company
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.620]   that figures out a way to get you
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.300]   to actually genuinely love your Roomba
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.940]   or like love it in the way that you would love a pet,
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.100]   there's a lot to be gained.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.020]   - Yeah, and I think it's scary
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.420]   depending on who the company is
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.300]   'cause then they can manipulate you.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.140]   - Yeah.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.180]   - If you love your Roomba
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.700]   and all of a sudden your Roomba starts telling you
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.780]   to buy stuff or it's leaving.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.100]   - To put lotion on Jeff Bezos's head.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:06.940]   - Yeah.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.140]   I don't know where the lotion came in,
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.500]   but yes, maybe buy certain.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.740]   - I just imagine my Amazon Echo being like,
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.640]   "Hey, Jeff Bezos is really a great guy."
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.820]   - But even though you haven't,
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.580]   do you think it's possible to fall in love with a robot?
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.720]   - Yeah, I mean, people fall in love with things all the time.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.900]   - Well, people have fallen in love
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.680]   with your shitty robots probably.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.180]   I guarantee you there's people listening to this
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.620]   that are a little bit heartbroken
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.220]   saying that you've never fallen in love
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.460]   with your shitty robot.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.660]   They're like, "But I had a really,
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.260]   "like I had an emotional connection to that robot."
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.860]   Like the one with the parent, Patsy on the back.
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.980]   - Oh, that one, that one I do like.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.420]   I like that one a lot.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.900]   That's probably my favorite shitty robot.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.740]   - Can you explain it?
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.500]   - So it's a machine, it was my friend Daniel Beauchamp
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.060]   and I, we had this long running joke
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.460]   about a proud parent machine that you could give a quarter
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.700]   and it pats you on the shoulder and says, "Proud of you."
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.140]   So yeah, I still have that hanging on my wall
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.500]   in my workshop.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.580]   So that one I'm really happy with.
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.580]   I just think it's a really funny concept
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.420]   and also I executed the build well, so that was.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.140]   - So it's an arm?
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.180]   Like what's the build?
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.540]   - Yeah, I built it off of an old lamp arm.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.140]   Yeah, basically it's just a motorized arm
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:31.140]   and this kind of torso of a person.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.620]   - What's this, so it's actually a hand, right?
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.700]   Did I write that correctly?
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.500]   - It's like a laser cut, it's just laser cut plywood
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.220]   and it kind of has like, it looks creepy, which I like.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.060]   - Yeah, the creepy helps with the.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:47.020]   - Yeah, and yeah, it says, "Proud of you, son."
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.820]   Because I just thought that sounded more funny
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.340]   than proud of you, daughter,
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.100]   and also proud of you, son,
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.500]   just it immediately communicates that it's a parent.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.420]   It's not just like a colleague or something.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.580]   It's like, "Proud of you."
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.780]   (laughing)
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.620]   - Yeah.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.820]   - And it charges you a quarter for it.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.700]   - Yeah, but you add a like, chat GPT on top of that
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.780]   and fine tune it on conversations you've had
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.860]   with your parents and all of a sudden you have a thing
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.100]   that can fundamentally transform your psyche.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.180]   - Yeah.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.220]   - That's all it takes.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.420]   That's a beautiful creation.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.180]   How'd you come up with that creation?
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.500]   - That was my friend Daniel and I
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.620]   who had a long running joke about it.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.280]   - High level, can you speak to your creative process?
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.180]   - I think a lot of it,
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.700]   I mean it's changed.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.540]   - For the shitty robot,
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.780]   so it's actually separate. - For the shitty robot, yeah.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.140]   I mean it has a lot of overlap.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.420]   So it's identifying everyday problems
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.800]   and in the shitty robot era,
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.500]   I would kind of take an everyday problem like,
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.220]   "Oh, I have a hard time getting up in the morning,"
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.060]   and I would solve it in the most ridiculous,
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.780]   spectacular way I could think of.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.260]   So for waking up in the morning,
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.820]   it was having an alarm clock that slaps me in the face
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   with a rubber hand.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.420]   And what I'm doing now
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.900]   is still identifying everyday problems,
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:00.260]   but I'm actually trying to product design my way out of it.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.780]   - What in your experience was the funniest thing?
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.620]   Is it violence, like the hand slapping you?
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.620]   Food eating?
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.740]   Is there, or is it just a case of--
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.920]   - I think the funniest is,
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.140]   no, I think it's more like the proud parent machine.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.940]   It's not violent, it doesn't,
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.080]   there's no, nothing is just emotional
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   and it's kind of a commentary on this fraud.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.080]   Fraught relationship that we sometimes have
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.120]   with our parents and their pride of us.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.960]   - Sometimes, every time.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.140]   - Sometimes.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:33.060]   My dad visited like last week and he was like,
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.640]   "I just wanna say I'm so proud of you
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.960]   "and for the life you built for yourself."
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.760]   And that was really sweet.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.600]   - Yeah, it's really kind. - I'll put that
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.640]   on the back of my autobiography too.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.440]   - Yeah, it's not your fault, Simone.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.400]   (Simone laughs)
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.240]   It's not your fault.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.340]   - Some stuff is my fault.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.800]   - What was the longest one to complete
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.040]   for the shitty robots that you remember?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.360]   'Cause you spent, on a few of them,
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.760]   you spent quite a long time.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:03.200]   Which is also inspiring when you take so long on a project.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.200]   - Yeah, I think kind of in the more
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.040]   like fun, whimsical department rather than shitty robots,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.840]   I built recently this music box.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.040]   So like a small music box that kind of has a barrel
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.520]   with little spikes and it plays a song.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.360]   But I did a large version of that
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.320]   that pops a sheet of bubble wrap
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.840]   and then like plays tones into a pan flute.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.240]   So yeah, you can actually program it
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.440]   to play different songs.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.200]   That one kicked my butt in so many creative ways
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.760]   and it was such a pain.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   I think that is probably the like weird, funny project
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.960]   that's taken me the longest
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.000]   and like the biggest engineering effort.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.080]   - Where's the sound coming from?
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.000]   - So if you, it all came from me realizing
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.840]   that if you pop bubble wrap and you pop it right in front
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.960]   of the opening of a pan flute,
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.840]   or like one of the pipes,
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.400]   you can have it play different tones.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.760]   So that's what it does.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.960]   So I built this music instrument off of that.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.120]   - Okay, if it's okay, can you describe some,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.200]   something like how it works,
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.720]   some of the technical details here?
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.320]   - Yeah, so basically, I mean,
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.440]   one of the big issues that I had,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.200]   so I worked with, as of a year and a half back,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.800]   I hired an engineer, Stu.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.560]   So we were collaborating on it.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.320]   But a big issue that we had was feeding in
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   the bubble wrap sheet and like making sure
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.560]   that it feeds in straight and doesn't get skewed
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.560]   because you need to make like the popping feet,
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.680]   which is where you program this barrel
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.400]   to pop different bubbles,
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.680]   need to be so perfectly aligned on the bubble
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.160]   of the bubble wrap for it to pop in the right location.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.080]   - So there's a feeder for the bubble wrap,
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:43.920]   that's a challenge.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.000]   And then you have to have a barrel
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.840]   with the little baby feet on it that pops the bubble wrap.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.200]   - Why is it so exciting? - Making that barrel
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.280]   was a pain as well.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.560]   I had to get like this rotary set up for my CNC
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.640]   and yeah, it was a lot of work,
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.040]   but that was really fun.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.080]   And it's just like,
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:09.200]   this is probably my favorite privilege of my job
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.400]   is that I can go down any rabbit hole
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.480]   I think find interesting.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.520]   - Did you have a lot of joy from popping the bubbles?
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.480]   - A lot of self soothing.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.800]   And like I got to spend,
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.760]   I think I spent a week trying to figure out
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.040]   the best material to pop bubble wrap with,
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.120]   because if you have two,
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.440]   if you kind of put them to two through or through,
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.600]   if you put a sheet of bubble wrap through two rigid tubes,
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.240]   the air kind of just escapes from one side of the bubble
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.080]   into the other.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.880]   So what I realized was that if you have a squishy material,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.920]   like kind of a yoga mat material in between it,
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.640]   it actually, it prevents that
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.920]   and pops it a lot more reliably.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.640]   But like increasing the pop reliability
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.800]   was a huge effort as well.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.920]   - You have to pop a squishy thing with another squishy thing.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.760]   - 'Cause you don't need a lot of force.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.920]   Like you just need it to not,
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.400]   the air to not be able to escape anywhere.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.240]   - Wow.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.360]   - But then also we had,
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.120]   there was different qualities of bubble wrap
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.920]   where there was a lot of transference
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.040]   between different bubbles.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.440]   So instead of the bubble popping,
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.200]   it would just seep the air into a neighboring bubble
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.880]   and that like membrane would kind of,
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.640]   so, you know, I just like getting to spend weeks on weeks
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.040]   of just studying bubble wrap.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.480]   - Did you ever think about like publishing academic work
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.320]   on bubble wrap?
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.480]   - No.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.320]   - Wouldn't that be epic?
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.640]   'Cause nobody's done this.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.880]   I bet you nobody's done squishy material,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.560]   squishy versus squishy for popping.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.000]   - I bet somebody has, but you know, I always,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.240]   I thought I was gonna go into academia.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.340]   Like I was such an ambitious student.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.160]   I loved school.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.360]   I actually applied to MIT, but then I pulled out
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.080]   'cause I was like, no, I don't wanna do it.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.320]   But now I realize it's really good that I didn't
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   because I'm too much of a spaz.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.360]   - Too much of a spaz.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.600]   Now I'm distracted.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.400]   I'm thinking there must be papers about
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.480]   when you have two bubbles.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.200]   Yeah, you need to know the physics of two bubbles.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.760]   When you have two bubbles colliding, one will pop first
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.320]   and there has to be good models of that.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.040]   But that's very, that has to do with chemistry
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.200]   and whatever the material the bubble is made from.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.480]   But then, no, there's materials in here.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:31.200]   Somebody must understand bubble wrap deeply, like deeply.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.300]   - So I'm just gonna take a quick restroom break
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.360]   because Lex is on his own train now
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.840]   and I'm just gonna leave you to talk about bubble.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.520]   - I actually don't need to go to the restroom.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.560]   (all laughing)
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.640]   - I'm gonna insert a two hour instructional here
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.560]   with a blackboard where I--
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.080]   - It's the skill of a podcaster.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.480]   I feel like I could throw you any topic
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.720]   and you could just go on about it.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.480]   - I don't know if I have that skill.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.640]   I just love bubble wrap.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.960]   (all laughing)
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.800]   Okay.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.480]   - Bubble on bubble interaction, go.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.880]   - So you did mention at MIT,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.160]   you went to college for physics for one year
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.800]   and you dropped out.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.480]   What do you learn from that?
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.980]   Who do you think should and shouldn't go to college?
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.320]   - I think first of all, you shouldn't listen to me.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.400]   - That should be the name of your autobiography.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.480]   - First of all, you shouldn't listen to me.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:31.760]   I realized that I was there for the wrong reasons.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.680]   I had this deep,
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.840]   I got completely,
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.680]   starting to get grades in school,
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.280]   which in Sweden at that time,
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.560]   we started getting it at eighth grade.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.200]   So when I was 14,
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.920]   it just kind of hijacked my brain
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.000]   because I realized that I could put a number
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.920]   on how smart I was.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.320]   And I got obsessed with it.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.200]   And I wanted to study mechanical engineering
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.960]   because I was like, I like machines.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.200]   But then physics was kind of the hardest thing you could do
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.400]   and I had this deep need to prove to myself
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.560]   that I was smart.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.720]   So I started studying physics,
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.280]   realized I wasn't that smart.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.240]   I realized, or I mean, just mostly that I love math,
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.800]   but I don't love math 10 hours a day.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   And also I think I am a generalist through and through.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.720]   I'm decent at a fair amount of things,
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   but definitely not a specialist in any ways.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.680]   And it was such a specialist type of area
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.960]   that I felt like the other parts of my brain
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.840]   kind of just dwindled and died.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.800]   So I think most of all,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.440]   if people are thinking about going to college,
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.120]   and especially if you're here in the States
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.360]   and it's so fucking expensive,
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.480]   really, okay, there's two things I wanna do.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.680]   One is actually go to a workplace
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.800]   where people are doing the job
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.120]   that you think you wanna do
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.440]   if you wanna become a doctor,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.680]   like be at a hospital and try to see how doctors work
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.040]   and if you actually like it,
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.160]   because I feel like people have a lot of ideas
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.240]   of what it's gonna be like
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.920]   and it just doesn't match with reality.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.240]   And then I think when people figure out
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.760]   what they wanna do, there's kind of,
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.120]   that's two separate questions,
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.960]   or there's two questions that you can split out of that.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.280]   One is like, what do you actually wanna do?
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.280]   That for me, for the last 10 years is building stuff.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.200]   But then there's a second part to that question,
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.560]   which is what context do you wanna do that?
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.600]   Do you wanna build stuff at a startup
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.160]   or at a big corporation?
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.000]   Do you wanna build stuff for an art gallery
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.600]   or for the movies or for YouTube?
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.120]   And I think that's often like people only learn
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.680]   how to answer the first question,
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.760]   but then it's like the context means as much,
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.120]   because I was building stuff at Punch Through Design
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.480]   and I wasn't getting that deep fulfillment.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.520]   I felt like I wasn't fully using myself
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.360]   and hitting all of my gears
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.200]   because I just wasn't that motivated
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.200]   about building stuff for other people.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.640]   And I changed the context and everything changed.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.360]   - And so sometimes you do need to consider a resume
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.600]   and stuff like that, depending on the,
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.840]   but I think people consider that way too much,
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.880]   especially in modern times.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.200]   I feel like you don't need to go to college
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.080]   just for the resume.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.280]   I feel like the biggest benefit of college,
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   I mean, there's a bunch, but one is just to do hard things.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   But you could do hard things anywhere,
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.920]   but some people need to be,
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.040]   I was probably one of those people
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.880]   to be forced to do hard things.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:44.440]   And the other is to meet fascinating humans
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.920]   from all walks of life that are pursuing,
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.200]   they have all kinds of different passions
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.960]   and allows you to learn, depending on the major,
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.440]   you can learn generally
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   and you can search if you're doing it efficiently
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.160]   about what actually inspires you.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.560]   And then the other thing is the resume thing.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.240]   But ultimately you don't need college
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.560]   to find your passion to run with it.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.520]   - I mean, I have so much college FOMO though.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.520]   Like I think it's, I chose a different set of experiences.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:22.200]   And when I applied to MIT, I was, I think I was 24
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.440]   'cause I was like,
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.120]   "Maybe I should become an electrical engineer
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.400]   because I really liked electronics."
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.800]   But then I remember seeing that the average age was 18
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.520]   and I was like, "Oh, fuck no, I can't hang out
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.440]   or like be in a room filled with 18 year olds
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.920]   who are smarter than me."
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.200]   - Yeah.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.000]   - So I think I definitely like missed the train
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.960]   on having that experience,
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.320]   but at the same time I did so many other things
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.520]   and I chose other experiences and I wouldn't trade them.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.440]   But I still like, I mean, I'll go to on a campus
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.920]   and I'll be like, "Oh."
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.840]   But I think it's also because I have a dreamy idea
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.400]   of what it is because I never had to do it
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.360]   and practice fully.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.040]   - Exactly, it's the FOMO.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:02.880]   - Yeah.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.440]   - Yeah, a lot of people really struggle with that burden.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   They'll go, it doesn't matter how long you go through,
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.040]   if you don't go all the way to the PhD,
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.720]   a lot of people have the FOMO.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.920]   It's a silly little notion, I think.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.240]   'Cause I think you should be doing college or school
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.840]   until you find something that lights your heart aflame
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.360]   where you're like, "Fuck yes, I wanna do this."
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.200]   - Yeah.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.040]   - And run with it.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.240]   - I mean, you can find that in other contexts as well.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.880]   I've found it.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.720]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.640]   - Yeah, but it is a buffet of experiences that you can have.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.200]   - What about, what was the most fun robot to make?
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.680]   Or musical, artistic creation?
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.120]   Where the process was the most fun.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.800]   - They're all painful in different ways.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.640]   - So pain.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.480]   - Yeah.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.560]   - Do you find pain fun?
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.440]   - No, but it's definitely the pride
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.400]   of getting to pull something off
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.880]   or managing to pull something off
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:10.480]   even when it was really difficult is very satisfying.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.040]   - What was the difficult thing that you pulled off
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.020]   and you were like, "Yeah, this is cool."
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.760]   - I like working on jigsaw puzzles,
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.800]   but I don't like how much table space they take up
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.440]   'cause I just have one big table where I can do it.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.600]   And that's also my dining table.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.240]   So I made this mechanical table
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.800]   where you can switch between two tabletops.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.760]   And that was an incredibly painful project.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.320]   And I'm really happy with the outcome
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.480]   and so proud that I managed to pull it off.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.000]   - How does it switch tabletops?
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.920]   - It's a tambour mechanism.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.740]   So tambour, you'll have on old record player,
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.640]   like it's these like thin slats of wood
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.720]   with fabric on the back
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.760]   and you can kind of get them to go around curves.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.000]   So basically one of the tabletops
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.880]   or table surfaces is tambour.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.160]   And then there's a little crank
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.040]   and you can kind of roll it off to the side
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.080]   and it reveals another tabletop under it
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:02.000]   that you can lift up 'cause it's on cams.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.820]   So you can switch between the two.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:07.680]   I think that one was both really difficult to pull off.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.240]   And it's also one of few projects
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.640]   that I use in my everyday life.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.600]   Like I use it almost every day.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.240]   - You know what a really cool one was
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.080]   that was part of your Ted Talk
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.180]   where there's a rotating thing
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.280]   that you wear on your shoulders.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   Was that hard to make?
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.320]   So for people who haven't seen your Ted Talk,
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.840]   they should, of course.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.680]   But it's a, how would you describe that?
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.780]   - Oh, they cut out the best joke.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.520]   - How would you call that device?
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.360]   Sorry, I have to check that.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.180]   - I don't even know.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.120]   I never used it beyond the Ted Talk really.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.160]   Yeah, but basically it's a shoulder rig
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.200]   and it has this almost like Saturn ring looking platform
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.440]   that goes around.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.960]   I can't even remember what the problem proposition was
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.080]   that I was trying to solve.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.680]   - Variety probably, introducing variety to your life.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.520]   - Yeah, maybe.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.200]   - And an element of surprise
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.600]   because you can put popcorn as you did on it
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:01.400]   and it goes around as a little hand.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.680]   Why is it like a tiny hand funny?
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.520]   I don't know.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.160]   But it just slams whatever is on that thing into your face.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.960]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.560]   Was that easy to make?
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.800]   - Yeah, that one's fine.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.640]   I can.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.520]   I mean, my Ted Talk was so,
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.480]   yeah, for one, once again, they cut out my best joke.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.320]   - What was the best joke?
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.680]   - My best joke, they didn't even ask me about it.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.360]   It was, so there's this whole lead up
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.040]   where I built a chopping machine.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.520]   So it's a machine that chops vegetables
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.920]   and it has two giant knives and it goes,
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.000]   dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, and it's kind of terrifying.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:41.080]   And I show a video of it and then it ends on this gif
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.880]   of it chopping up a banana
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.080]   and I'm kind of scrunching up my face being like, ugh, ugh.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.000]   And the whole reason I show that project
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.760]   is because I'm leading it up to the punchline of,
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.040]   oh, and as a bonus, this gif right here
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.920]   is the perfect response if anyone ever sends you dick pics
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.760]   you don't want, which brought down the house.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.080]   It does it every time.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.800]   And they cut it out without asking me
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.040]   'cause they were like, oh, but we wanted people
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.280]   to be able to show it in classrooms.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.200]   And I was like, I have abandoned the hope
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.760]   of being shown in classrooms for years ago.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.160]   - I think that's a good joke.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.000]   - Thank you.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   - That's a really good one.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.200]   You're okay going sometimes a little bit edgy.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:23.600]   - I say that I'm crude and wholesome
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.720]   because I can be very crude,
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.480]   but I also try really, really hard to be a good person
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.920]   and to like, I'll say shit and fucking all that stuff,
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:39.760]   which I don't even think is crude, but yeah.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.480]   But I really, really try to wield the power
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.560]   that I have in a thoughtful way.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.880]   So no, I wouldn't call me edgy because I'm not,
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.440]   I don't think it's edgy.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.280]   It's all like sex and body.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.520]   - Chopping a banana with knives
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.000]   and saying it's a good gif response
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.600]   to anyone that sends you dick pics
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.840]   is definitely not edgy, you're correct, yeah.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.120]   - It's a funny joke.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.560]   - Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.920]   - I feel bad that Ted cut that.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   - I mean, it's fine.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.920]   It's a decision that I made really early on
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.640]   where I was like, I think often people misinterpret
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.360]   what I'm doing as being for children,
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.200]   which I think is part,
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.920]   because my projects were always really colorful and fun,
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.080]   but I think it also has some sprinkles of sexism
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.480]   of being like, oh, it's a woman doing something.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.120]   She must be doing it for the children.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.160]   And I'm like, fuck the children, I'm doing it for myself.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.000]   So I think I was just really early on decided of like,
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.840]   oh no, I'm not gonna try to cater to that,
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.760]   which still, I mean, I get a lot of messages
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.600]   from parents being like,
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.760]   can you please stop cussing in your videos?
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.080]   And I'm also like, I get it,
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.600]   but also that is not what's gonna mess up your kids.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.280]   I really try to be thoughtful
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.240]   and a decent enough role model,
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.680]   but I'll also acknowledge that humans fuck.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.640]   - Yeah. - It's okay.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.040]   - Somehow that you being able to say the F-U to the system.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:05.880]   - What word?
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.200]   Word?
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.040]   What?
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:08.860]   Do it.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.700]   - I can't.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.540]   I'm scared.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.360]   - Yeah.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.600]   (both laughing)
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.800]   - It sounds better when you say F-U.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.640]   It's a dance.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.900]   I should, oh boy.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:25.320]   Have you ever made a robot that dances with you?
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.400]   - No. - Okay.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.760]   - You need a dance partner.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.280]   - I get lonely sometimes. - Is this a personal request?
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.080]   - Yeah, I feel like that's the theme
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.800]   of this whole podcast, yeah.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.720]   What's the most embarrassed you've ever been
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.980]   on your podcast?
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:45.520]   - So I don't know if you've experienced this,
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.120]   but I'm generally embarrassed
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.720]   by most things I say inside my head.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.640]   - Yeah.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.200]   - So like when I say something,
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:59.180]   like now, there's a voice inside my head that goes,
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:00.860]   (chuckles)
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:01.680]   - Yeah.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.520]   - Like what?
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.340]   (chuckles)
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.620]   You're a disappointment.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.940]   Like the parent petting you in the back,
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.900]   the hand stops working.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:09.740]   - Yeah.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.560]   - Just slows down.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.540]   And then there's an awkward silence.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:17.500]   You don't know what to say next.
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.240]   That's really embarrassing usually.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.540]   - I used to work as a journalist,
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.980]   so I know how to sit with a silence
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.700]   and try to drag it out of you.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.960]   (chuckles)
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:35.540]   - See what I did there?
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.380]   (chuckles)
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.220]   - You gave up.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.700]   You pulled out.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.780]   - I quit.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.620]   - You blanked.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.440]   - I was sweating.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.460]   I was literally sweating.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.300]   Okay.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.140]   - Also 'cause you're in a full fucking suit.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:45.960]   What is that?
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.660]   Like how did that come about?
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.020]   - Actually it was probably MIT
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:55.020]   is because everybody was dressing in like sweatpants.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.340]   Very chill wear.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.260]   And I was like, I like taking everything seriously.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.860]   It just felt like, it was my way of saying F you
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.420]   to the way things are.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.820]   'Cause I like, I always admire Richard Feynman.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.120]   I like it how there's like a classiness to it.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.380]   So I don't know if it's for visual purposes,
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.420]   but it's just how I feel when I put on a suit.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:20.040]   It makes me feel like I'm gonna take this
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.500]   really, really seriously.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.940]   And if I embarrass myself, it's all my fault.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.740]   'Cause I tried, there's no excuse.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.100]   I tried a hundred percent.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.460]   The interesting thing about your Ted talk
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.920]   to go to a dark topic.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.100]   - Is what happened when I walked off stage?
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.660]   - No, what happened when you walked off stage?
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.500]   - Found out that I had a brain tumor.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.620]   Was that not where you're going?
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.380]   There's something else dark about my, yeah.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.320]   - Well, yes.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.420]   I thought you knew through the Ted talk.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.780]   You found out right after.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.700]   - I mean, the reason that I found out
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.260]   was partly because of the Ted talk.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.400]   'Cause my mom came into town to be there for it.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.900]   And my right eyelid was swollen
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.340]   and it had kind of been swelling over a while.
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.220]   And I even got in comments about it on my YouTube channel.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.700]   And I thought it was allergies.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.620]   'Cause I was like, oh, it's just pollen allergies.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.140]   It's just affecting my one eye.
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.860]   'Cause maybe I sleep mostly on that side.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.020]   I don't know.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:24.020]   And my mom came into the States
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.500]   and then Vancouver for my Ted talk.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.940]   And she was like, Simone, you have to have a scan
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.900]   or see what's up.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.180]   Well, we have to go to the doctor.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.460]   And she really pushed me to do it.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.360]   'Cause I was like, I'm fine.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:42.140]   And I had an MRI scan on 5 p.m. on a Friday night.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:47.460]   My boyfriend at the time was there.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:52.180]   And I remember halfway through an MRI scan,
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:57.180]   they kind of pull you out and they inject contrast fluid.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:01.100]   Or this thing that just gives them another type of scan.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:05.160]   And the nurse looked at me in this way and was like,
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.540]   how long have you had symptoms for?
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.380]   And that's when I knew that they'd found something.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.260]   And then they shove you back into the machine
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.620]   for another 20 minutes.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.660]   And my ex was just seeing them zooming in and out
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.580]   of my scans.
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.940]   And there was like this, obviously,
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.500]   something that just looked wrong in there.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.260]   And they sent me to the ER and I found out
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:27.660]   that I had a brain tumor, the size of a golf ball.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.940]   They've probably been grown since I was a teenager.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.660]   So it'd been growing over like 10, 15 years.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.140]   And yeah, I had surgery to remove it.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:37.060]   And then it kept on growing,
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.300]   the parts that they couldn't remove.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.740]   And I went through radiation treatment.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:44.740]   So that was like two years that just was kind of dedicated
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.060]   to just getting better and getting back to where I am now.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:53.220]   And I remember, like I was so stoked about 2020
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.220]   'cause I was like, this is the first year
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.980]   that I'm not held back by my health.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.220]   And I'm like finally gonna be able to do everything
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.060]   I've feathered.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.500]   And then the pandemic happens and you're kind of just like,
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.420]   okay, just in the backseat of what's happening
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.660]   and things that are out of my control again.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.060]   - In your public, you made a couple of videos about it.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.460]   I have a brain tumor, my brain tumor's back.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.700]   You kind of, you name your tumor Brian.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.340]   You kind of make it a lighthearted thing.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.860]   So you don't reveal much of the darkness.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.700]   But were you scared or some low points?
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:30.420]   - Of course I was scared.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.440]   I mean, it's terrifying.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.620]   And also when it's in your brain,
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:41.140]   I was like, take any other part of me,
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.580]   but don't take my brain.
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:48.580]   Um, no, it's this unfathomable thing that happens.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.780]   And you're like, I'm healthy.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.220]   I've had, how could this possibly be a brain tumor?
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.340]   Like my eye is swollen.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.560]   Like there's nothing there.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.700]   I haven't had any seizures.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.780]   I haven't had any cognitive issues.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:01.500]   I haven't had any headaches even.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.220]   Like how is that even possible?
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.160]   So you go through a lot of different stages
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.980]   of just trying to understand what it is.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:12.100]   And I think I remember being hit,
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:14.940]   like right as I found out when we're in like an Uber,
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.180]   poor Uber driver,
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.740]   from where I had my MRI scan to the ER where they sent me.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:24.180]   And I was really, both really grateful
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.380]   that I've gotten so much more out of life
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.540]   than I ever thought I would.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.980]   Like I've had a hell of a life.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.220]   And even if it would have ended really early,
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.040]   I would have done so much more than I ever thought.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.660]   But I was also really, really sad
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.000]   that I hadn't had kids yet.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.820]   Like that was my big grief of like,
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.440]   fuck, I haven't had time to have kids yet.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.220]   But no, it's terrifying.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.620]   I mean, the prospect of somebody cutting up your head,
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.980]   like that's terrifying.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:55.980]   But it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.740]   - What about the radiation treatment?
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:02.260]   What are some things that, you know, people should,
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.780]   you learned about it,
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.260]   about the process and about yourself through that,
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.960]   that people might be interested about?
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.240]   - I think surgery was both harder and easier
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.160]   than radiation treatment because it was harder
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.520]   because it was so much more intense.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.600]   And it's such a dramatic thing,
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.520]   like going to the hospital that morning and being like,
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.680]   I don't know, and you feel so awful when you wake up.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.400]   But then the recovery from it was pretty linear.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.320]   Like almost every week I would get a little bit better.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.780]   The thing about radiation is that it was not linear at all.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.740]   And it kind of drained me in this weird,
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.260]   like it was so hard to predict.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.160]   And also they put me on these,
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:53.300]   I spent months feeling like I was high out of my mind
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.500]   and I couldn't process reality
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.820]   in a way that I normally would.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.380]   Like everything just felt off.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.140]   Like I felt, yeah, I felt like I was high on drugs.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:04.340]   And I kept on asking my doctors what was going on.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.780]   And they're like, no, I don't know.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.040]   Don't think it's anything related.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.760]   And I was on this Alzheimer's medicine
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.960]   that they put you on to prevent dementia
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.760]   from radiation treatment, like kind of as a preventative.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.940]   And I found all these subreddits of people
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.440]   using that Alzheimer's medicine to get high.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.280]   And people would be like, oh my God, bro,
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.480]   I was like 20 milligrams yesterday
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.120]   and I was high out of my mind.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.640]   And I'm like, I'm on 30 milligrams a day.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.840]   And they're like, of course it feels weird.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.980]   And that was honestly one of the scariest parts of it
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.860]   because that was the first time where I felt like
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:45.560]   it genuinely affected my way of processing reality.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.280]   And yeah, I was so relieved when I found out
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.640]   that that was what was causing it
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.160]   'cause I felt like I was going crazy.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.560]   But even after surgery, like I woke up
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.000]   and I felt like myself, like everything was,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.480]   I got no brain injury.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.380]   So obviously this is like my experience
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:04.000]   from somebody who came out of it pretty unscathed,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.720]   who didn't get any brain injuries
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.560]   and didn't have to do any of that recovery.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.040]   It's more just the recovery from like the physical act
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.560]   of somebody cutting your skull open
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.680]   and taking a large chunk out.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.760]   - Did you research all the things that can go wrong
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.280]   during surgery? - No, no.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.660]   I honestly, I'm a bit surprised by how I acted.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:29.320]   Just pausing for you to pour.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.700]   (both laughing)
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.100]   You're welcome, editors.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:37.780]   - This is like a commercial.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.940]   - This is like work injury from being a YouTuber.
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.740]   It's all like freeze if there's audio that comes in.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:47.920]   Yeah, sponsored by tap water.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:54.720]   I was surprised by how little I was willing to
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.960]   think critically about what my doctors told me to do.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.760]   Like I very early on, the neurologist that I worked with,
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.800]   he was the one who was on call at the ER
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.480]   the day where I came in.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.760]   And he was the one who ended up doing my surgery.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.980]   And he kind of became like my rock in this.
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.280]   And I just 100% trusted him.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.520]   And he turned out to be an amazing doctor
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.680]   and like did a great job and was just like,
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.240]   so I got so, so lucky.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.780]   But I remember my mom being like,
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.000]   "Oh, but we should like talk about second opinions.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.240]   And like, we should try to do more research."
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.160]   And I was like, so unwilling to do that
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.420]   because opening up to the idea that there are
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:44.700]   multiple ways or multiple things that might be right
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.800]   or wrong was so terrifying.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.320]   Like I wanted there to just be like,
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.720]   "No, this is the only option.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.800]   This is what we need to do."
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.580]   And if I started questioning that,
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.000]   then I don't know if I would have been able
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.560]   to go through with it.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.600]   So yeah, it was a strange,
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.660]   I just really wanted to trust the doctors
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.040]   that I worked with.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.080]   And I was very scared to question them in any way.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.180]   - How did that process change your relationship with death?
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:13.780]   Are you afraid of death?
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:16.960]   Do you ponder your mortality?
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.600]   - Yeah, I think it took away a part of youth for me.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.880]   - Like the innocence?
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.080]   - Yeah, I mean, you kind of think of terrible things
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.240]   as something that happens to other people
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.020]   and death and illness.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.160]   So I think it kind of fast-tracked that for me.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:40.720]   But it mostly changed my relationship to life.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.520]   It changed, it's made me so much more gentle with myself.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.840]   Like going through illness,
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.360]   it forces you to redefine what it means to be good.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.400]   And before, being good had been pushing myself really hard.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.960]   It had been working and I don't know,
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.320]   just being really hard with myself and disciplined.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.640]   And when you're healing from something,
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.880]   being good is listening to your body.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.840]   It's resting.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.600]   It's like really being in tuned with what your health,
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.400]   where your health is at.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.760]   And I think that is something that's kind of stuck with me
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.600]   since then.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.040]   I'm so much more gentle and delicate with myself.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:23.920]   - And with others?
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.680]   - I think it definitely, it's like,
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.720]   when you're young and healthy,
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.720]   it's really hard to know what it feels like to be ill.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:42.080]   And I remember, you know, you go to yoga class
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.760]   and you'd be like, "Oh my God, this is too slow.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.680]   "I want it to be, I have so much more energy.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.800]   "I need to."
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.800]   And when I was recovering from my brain surgery,
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.920]   there was this yoga studio nearby my house
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.000]   and they had yoga for seniors.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.400]   And I was so stoked 'cause I was like,
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.840]   "Oh, this is a yoga class I'll be able to take."
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.080]   And I think that was really eyeopening.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.880]   I was just like, there's no,
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.280]   you kind of imagine that it's just like,
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.600]   "Oh, just push yourself harder."
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.880]   But no, that's not it.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.040]   With age or sickness or it's just,
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.720]   you gotta be so gentle with yourself
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.560]   and you have to cater to people where they're at.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.360]   - Yeah, and just the appreciation of this
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.720]   like biological vehicle you get
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.960]   and you should take care of it.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.640]   - Being sick sucks.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.400]   It's awful.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.400]   And I'm really motivated to postpone that
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.840]   for as much as I can.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.120]   And also I was so tremendously grateful when I got ill
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.320]   that I felt like I had so much to take from.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.400]   Like I had so many energy reservoirs.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.200]   I'd spent my life taking pretty decent care of my body
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.560]   and like exercising and eating well
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.640]   and like not wrecking my body in any way.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.200]   And I felt like this was the first time
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.840]   where that was so critical
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.560]   and I felt like my body was ready for it.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:07.200]   - I thought you were gonna go the other way.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.880]   Like you can take care of your body all you want
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.760]   and it's bad stuff happens.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.680]   So you should go on drug binges
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.160]   and go wild and do crazy things.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.040]   - I mean, I also had that thought where I was like,
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.360]   I fucking floss every day.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.880]   How do I have a brain tumor?
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.080]   I've been good.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.120]   Like why does this happen to me?
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.440]   But more so it was like my body was so resilient
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.000]   and ready for it.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.960]   And I was really, really proud of it.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.360]   - It's amazing that the human body is able to recover
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.880]   from even the harshest things.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.640]   - Yeah, it's wild.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.960]   And my brain, so after surgery,
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.080]   'cause yeah, I had a brain tumor
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.560]   the size of a golf ball,
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.160]   kind of behind my right eye.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.280]   And after brain surgery,
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.680]   you kind of just have this big hole in your head,
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.240]   like this void.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:01.640]   And usually your brain stays that way.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.320]   Like it retains the shape
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.680]   even after the brain tumor is gone.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.400]   But for some reason, my brain was feeling really ambitious
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.360]   and it has completely flopped back.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.240]   And I have almost like a normal looking brain now
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.080]   where doctors are like,
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.920]   oh, we would almost not be able to tell that you had one.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.840]   So yeah, that just blew my mind.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.120]   I'm like, when did it?
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.360]   Was that why I had all those headaches after surgery?
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.760]   It's just my brain being like, ah!
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.160]   - Trying, working, yeah.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.840]   Oh, pretty cool thing I wanted to ask you about
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.480]   is the everyday calendar that you worked on.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.240]   That was a long time.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.240]   That took a long time.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.240]   - Yeah, so basically I designed this calendar.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.000]   Like I wanted to start meditating every day,
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.120]   but it's really hard to meditate every day
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.680]   and to like kind of build that habit.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.640]   And what I would do is I would make these grids
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.280]   in my notebooks where I could like check a box for every day.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.880]   Like I just wanted like a little ding, I did it.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.880]   And like this thing of accountability.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.000]   But then I was like, this is,
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.040]   I don't wanna have a notebook that I do this in.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.760]   Like I want an art piece that I can hang on my wall,
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.000]   like accountability art.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.200]   And I made this thing called the everyday calendar,
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.280]   which has an entire year on it.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.920]   So it's 365 days.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.560]   And if you tap any of the days, you light it up.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.520]   And we turned it into a Kickstarter campaign
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.240]   and it's now a product that I'm selling
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.960]   through my product business, The Yacht Store.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.120]   - What's it called?
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.720]   - The Yacht Store.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.840]   - And that for people who are confused
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.960]   is the right way to pronounce your last name.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.400]   - Which it's right, but it's so wrong.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.240]   My last name is spelled G-I-E-R-T-Z.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.440]   - Who does that song?
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.280]   If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.440]   - Yeah, pronouncing my last name, Yacht.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.940]   - That's what makes me, 'cause what's his name?
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:56.920]   From the office, he covers it from the British office,
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.120]   which is the better office.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.280]   Okay, tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.920]   So you said you created the everyday calendar
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.160]   to make a more beautiful, in quotes,
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.960]   and more sacred gold star system on a wall,
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.560]   not a notebook that gets thrown into a drawer.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.020]   - Yeah, wow, well said past me.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.560]   - You said that making this calendar
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.080]   taught you a lot, in quotes.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.540]   I feel like a real investigative journalist.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:26.880]   You've said in 2018--
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.240]   - Yeah, I'm waiting for the gotcha.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.960]   - Can you share some of the lessons you've learned?
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.840]   Like what do you mean you've learned a lot
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.040]   from making this calendar?
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.400]   What are we talking about?
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.200]   - As somebody who builds things,
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.480]   manufacturing something is such an unrelated process.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.640]   Like making one of something
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.120]   and making 10,000s of something,
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.600]   like they're not even distant cousins.
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.320]   Like it's completely different beasts to tackle.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.720]   And yeah, so that was one of it.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.280]   Everything takes so much longer
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.320]   than you think it's going to.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.880]   I did a Kickstarter campaign that we launched in 2018
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.360]   after my surgery.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.080]   And yeah, it's just, you know,
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   we think you're so generous with the timelines.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.000]   We still ended up being a year late,
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.820]   but we shipped, we're good.
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:14.880]   But yeah, I mean, I'm trying to get my product business
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.760]   off the ground.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.560]   We launched in May.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.000]   And it's just, yeah, it's just a pain.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.840]   As somebody who's terrified of disappointing people,
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.540]   I'm like, why have I chosen some of the jobs
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.840]   where it's the easiest to disappoint people?
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.840]   - You can disappoint people at scale now.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.760]   - Yeah, I can disappoint people at scale
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.360]   and also them actually having paid me money
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.040]   to deliver on something, which is a terrible transaction.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:44.960]   But I'm just stoked to realize that I love the job still.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.600]   Like I love the product development aspect of it.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.800]   I love trying to design stuff for manufacturing
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.800]   and figure it out and like anticipate
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.160]   how people are gonna use your products
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.640]   and like the everyday calendar.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.680]   I mean, we've sold thousands of them now.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.680]   They're all over the world.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.680]   And it's like people actually finding something useful
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:09.840]   that I made and implementing them into their lives.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.320]   It's just mind boggling.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.760]   - Especially 'cause this is tracking habits, good habits.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.080]   - Or bad ones, you can do it however.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.040]   (both laughing)
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.800]   You can use it however you want.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.920]   - I went in a drinking binge again today.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.280]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.720]   - Great success. - Kicked another kid.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   (both laughing)
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.120]   - What does it take to mass manufacture something?
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.280]   What did you learn about that?
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.160]   Like what are, can you like elucidate the gap
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.520]   between the one, the prototype versus the product development
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.640]   for mass manufacture?
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.120]   - I mean, for one of it is like, yeah, the manufacturing,
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.440]   the tooling that they use in manufacturing
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:49.880]   and to do things in a cost-effective way
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.640]   is really different.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.480]   Like I can make a one-off,
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.280]   then it's gonna take me 17 hours.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.000]   But obviously you can't spend 17 hours per calendar
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.960]   when you're doing something in factory.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.720]   I think it's that like quality control is such a beast.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.400]   You cannot trust anybody telling you
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.840]   that things are gonna be okay.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.080]   Like you have to have such trust issues.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.720]   And it's also terrifying.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.120]   I mean, as somebody who's doing everything independently,
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.680]   I haven't raised any capital for it.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.480]   Like it's all self-invested and we're doing it all in-house.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   It's just, yeah, I could buy 10,000 calendars,
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.800]   but then what if all of them have a manufacturing issue?
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:41.800]   Or it's just terrifying because the risks are so high.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.480]   But also I got to this point where for one,
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.640]   this is something that I wanted to do for a long time,
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.600]   but something that going through health problems taught me
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.480]   is how fragile my business model is.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.240]   Because I mean, I'm basically running an influencer business
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:02.200]   where I make videos on YouTube and then I have an ad spot
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.560]   and I talk about a brand.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.080]   So like I'm a human billboard, which is fine.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.800]   It grants me a lot of freedom to play around.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.840]   But if I am not well enough to be on a stage giving talks
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:17.600]   or be in front of a camera, everything stops.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.720]   Like it's such a pillar of a business
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.040]   and it can topple over at any given moment.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.880]   Or like YouTube could change the algorithm,
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.120]   like legislation could catch up
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.800]   and change how you're able to advertise on the internet.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.080]   Like it's so frail and I really felt like I need
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.280]   to diversify what I'm doing
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.320]   and also just to keep it interesting for myself.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.640]   So what I decided was to start a product business
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.080]   because also it's kind of this perfect combination
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.600]   of businesses where I can turn my YouTube channel
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.080]   into an R&D department.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.960]   'Cause I have a reason to constantly be exploring things
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.040]   and churning out new products.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.080]   I can also do that as early audience testing
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.280]   and see what people are actually excited about.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.560]   And if there's something that I think
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.600]   would make an interesting product,
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.720]   I can pass that over to the product business.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.440]   And then once I'm ready to market that and sell it,
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.280]   I can pass it over to the YouTube channel.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.040]   So it's like, I can kind of,
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.840]   once I realized that YouTube
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:16.320]   didn't feel like an end goal for me,
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.520]   I was like, okay, then I can use it as a tool
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.640]   to accomplish these other things that I wanna do.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.560]   And this was one of them.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.760]   So yeah, it's a lot that went into it.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.720]   - And one of the tools, like you said, is R&D,
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.200]   but it's also kind of advertisement
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.680]   for the cool stuff that you're doing.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.120]   I think Mr. Beast is one of the creators
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.520]   that's also starting to understand this power
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.000]   of this reputation that you've built
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   of people trust you, they love you to do cool stuff.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.280]   They trust that you put your heart and soul into a thing.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.720]   And they feel your pain and the struggle too.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.120]   Like if a product, for example, say the everyday calendar,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.400]   like there was issues in manufacturing or something like this.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.960]   - Which we've had, yeah.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.800]   - They would feel the pain of that
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.040]   and there was still support.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.360]   I mean, that's the beauty of it
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.720]   when you have the actual person right there
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.960]   struggling with their lows and highs.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.180]   - That's a decision that I made really early on
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.020]   where I was like, the Yacht Store is supported by me,
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.640]   but it's separate from me.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.440]   It's not merchandise.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.680]   You don't have to know who I am
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.800]   or care about who I am to be interested in this product.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.240]   And if you go on the website, Yacht.Store, plug.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.240]   It's like, I'm on the about page, Y-E-T-C-H.Store.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.120]   Like you have to go to the about page
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.280]   to find anything about me.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.680]   Like it's definitely not like this is Samo's brand.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.960]   And I think anybody who's followed me for a long time
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:45.400]   will see that like my personality is sprinkled into it,
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.560]   but it's still like clean off of me.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.520]   And I think that's also because I wanted something
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.600]   that was separate from me.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.880]   'Cause I am also running out of narcissism,
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.080]   believe it or not.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.160]   Like I don't feel like I wanna,
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.040]   I don't want it to be about me.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.320]   And I want it to be something
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.280]   that can also run independently of me and doesn't,
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.480]   like I wanna be able to retire my face
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.000]   and still do like the other stuff because I think it's fun,
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.200]   but I don't want that to be the core of it.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.840]   - What other kind of stuff have you worked on
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.920]   for the product design for Y-E-T-C-H?
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.320]   - So, I mean, a lot of the products,
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.720]   I decided to launch the store
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.680]   with a really small roster of products
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.760]   because developing products is such a,
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.760]   it's such upfront heavy, like cost-wise and just investment.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.440]   It's very big upfront investment.
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:43.440]   So, and I know that it would take a while
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.680]   or I knew it would take a while for me
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.360]   to kind of find the right tonality
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.080]   and visual language for the brand.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.400]   So I just wanted to launch it, have it be out there,
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.760]   start working on it, start like learning more
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.560]   about what it entails,
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.520]   even if we just had a small roster of products.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.560]   So we released it with, we have a puzzle.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.480]   (Dana laughs)
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.600]   - Yes. - This is just a whim.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:07.720]   But I wanted to release a puzzle that has one piece missing.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.680]   So it's actually, as far as I can tell,
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.160]   it's the world's first officially incomplete puzzle.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.520]   You get 499 out of 500 pieces.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.480]   I keep the 500th piece.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.840]   So I have a box in my workshop
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.280]   with everybody's missing pieces.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.200]   - Yeah. - And I don't know
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.640]   what to do with it yet, but someday it will come to me.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.480]   - Profound artistic statement.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.800]   - It is something.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.800]   It's definitely something.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.480]   And I'm surprised by how many of them we've sold,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.560]   which I'm also like,
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.080]   I kind of wanted to have that product out there
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.880]   'cause I was like, can you imagine having a pitch deck?
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.600]   If I do ever raise money of being like,
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.120]   you know how good I am at selling things?
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.640]   I sold people 5,000 incomplete puzzles.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.600]   - Incomplete puzzles. - Yeah.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.560]   Also have, you know, it's like a lot of the products,
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.800]   I call them basket fillers.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.720]   Like they're kind of just like stuff where I'm like,
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.640]   yeah, this is like easy to throw into your basket.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.840]   I mean, we have these rings, I'm wearing them.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.120]   So there's a screwdriver ring,
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.720]   which is a Phillips head screwdriver,
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.360]   and then a screw ring that kind of has a recess,
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.880]   like a Phillips head screw.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:09.000]   I have these sawdust socks that make you look like
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.280]   your feet are covered in sawdust.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.400]   Like you spent all time in the, all day in the shop
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.120]   without having to put any of the actual effort in.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.680]   But then we have four more products in the pipeline
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.720]   that we're working on and that are kind of the more,
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.480]   the big ambitious products that are more in line
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.720]   with what I want the brand to be.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.840]   Like the tagline is unique solutions to everyday problems.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.840]   And it's just a lot of like trying to develop novel takes
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.480]   on existing products.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.800]   - So something where the function becomes a bigger,
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.160]   bigger part of the design.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.000]   - Yeah.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.240]   - And so what's the process of creating something like that?
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.200]   Like the, even the everyday calendar.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.720]   So like, what are some challenges that are interesting
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.560]   along the way?
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.280]   So you have to sketch it out.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.160]   You have to like brainstorm, draw things out,
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.520]   and then create a schematic and see like how,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.680]   how do you know what it's going to look like visually?
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.120]   - You don't.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.000]   And it's, I mean, I, so the everyday calendar, the first,
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.200]   so I just built it for myself first.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.480]   Like that did not come as a product idea first.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.260]   And that's kind of been the process that I've had
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:14.100]   for a lot of things.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.000]   Like I make it for myself and then I'm like, oh,
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.840]   maybe other people would find this useful too.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.360]   So the everyday calendar, the first prototype I made,
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:25.520]   it had actually physical mechanical toggle switches.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.320]   So 365 toggle switches that you could flip.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.880]   So if you worked out that day or meditated,
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.160]   for me it was meditating, you can just flip that switch.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.880]   And that was great.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.740]   But when I started evaluating it as a product, it's,
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:42.660]   if you have 365 of something in a product,
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.100]   like the runaway cost is crazy.
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:49.940]   So the cheapest option, most reliable option we could find
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.200]   was capacitive touch.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:54.000]   So basically it's a touch interface.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.320]   And the front plate is a circuit board itself.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.320]   So it's this like circuit board that's designed
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.400]   in this really fancy way.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.840]   So it looks like a beautiful piece of art,
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.000]   not to do my own work too much,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.480]   but it's actually a circuit board,
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.020]   which I also thought was really interesting
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.760]   of like using this that people usually hide away
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.080]   in products.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.600]   And it felt like a nod to my career in electronics as well,
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.960]   of being like, no, let's make it pretty.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   Let's make it, put it front and forward.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:29.480]   But yeah, I mean, what I'm realizing now more and more
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.640]   is like, there's so many of like,
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.760]   I would love to turn the puzzle table into a product,
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.680]   but then it's like, that would be a $7,000 table.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.960]   And I don't wanna sell a table for $7,000.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.540]   So you're kind of limited to the price bracket you're in.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.600]   And it's like, your margins are tough.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.420]   Like maintaining your margins are really, really tough.
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.920]   And as somebody who's like,
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.200]   I would love to sell the stuff that we're doing cheaper,
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.180]   but you just, it's just not feasible.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:56.240]   Like you need those margins to survive.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.760]   - Well, one of the genius things
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.440]   in the conversations I've had with Elon
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.440]   is the ability through sort of systematic questioning
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.640]   of how things have been done in the past
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.000]   to discuss what is the lowest cost way to solve a problem.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.040]   And so he's very good at getting to,
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.880]   like with Optimus Robot, for example, the humanoid robot,
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.320]   how do you get the cost down?
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.160]   - Yeah.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.000]   - And that seems to be like
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.200]   one of the essential things to do
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:26.900]   in any product that you have to mass manufacture
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:29.580]   is constantly discuss, like how do we simplify, simplify?
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.180]   - It's definitely a design limitation.
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.100]   It's interesting.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.380]   It's both hard and interesting to work within.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.820]   And that's such a different thing as well.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.700]   It's like, I mean, as I talked about before,
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:40.220]   like what is the context in which you're creating things?
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.340]   Like I'm still building things.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:42.820]   I'm still inventing things,
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.940]   but I changed the context
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.580]   and it has a very different set of limitations
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:50.260]   and constantly trying to simplify your product
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.780]   to make it cheaper.
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:54.600]   And yeah, it's a really interesting
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.320]   and different type of design process.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.440]   - You can lose some of the magic though, right?
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:02.120]   Like people can do that a little bit too much.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.500]   I think Apple is famous, like Johnny Ive is famous
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:07.640]   for sort of focusing on design first
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.080]   and not worrying about the cost later
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.920]   'cause you don't wanna sacrifice.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.520]   There's some stuff that's gonna cost more,
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.360]   but it keeps some of the magic.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.920]   - I think it's for some of the products
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.360]   that we're working on, it's like,
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.120]   I'm like, let's just make it the best we think it can be
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.920]   and then we can scale back from there.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.720]   Like, let's not impose these limitations
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.820]   on ourselves up front.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.580]   Like, let's just make it the most beautiful version
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.720]   of itself and then we can decide
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.120]   what we wanna compromise with or compromise on, yeah.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.560]   - That's what I say every day when I look in the mirror.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.600]   Let's just make it the most beautiful.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.440]   - And then we can compromise, yeah.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.040]   (laughing)
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.440]   So you put on that suit.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.280]   - Yeah.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.640]   - And then see how shit goes wrong later.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.680]   All right, back a little bit to the robots,
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:59.240]   just, or actually to one of your more epic projects.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.280]   I mean, they're all epic, but Truckla.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.560]   - Yeah.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.680]   - You cutting into a Tesla and turning into an epic truck.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:06.520]   What was that like?
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.400]   Where did the idea come from?
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.960]   - The idea came from that I really wanted
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.800]   an electric pickup truck.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.680]   Like, I'm only really driven electric
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.760]   because I got my driver's license pretty late
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.520]   and I'm like one of that first generation drivers.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.200]   It's like probably never gonna have a gas vehicle.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.720]   But yeah, this was in 2018 as well.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.560]   2018 was a big year.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.800]   Or 2019, I can't remember.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   And I figured that we could just make our own.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.760]   - So you took a Tesla?
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.880]   - Tesla Model 3.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.720]   - Model 3?
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:45.420]   And you cut off a piece of it.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.160]   And you turn it into a pickup truck.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.000]   What's the...
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.440]   (laughing)
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.400]   It looks pretty badass.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.640]   So what are some of the challenges of doing that?
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.200]   It's unlike other projects you've done.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.600]   - Yeah, it's very much outside of my realm.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.200]   Like I'm not a car person.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.840]   I haven't worked on cars before.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.920]   So we brought in a big team
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.200]   and had another project manager for it and stuff.
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.000]   'Cause also like cars,
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.880]   you definitely don't want things to go wrong.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.840]   There's no part of me that wants to fuck around
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.840]   and make something that's gonna be really unsafe for me
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.040]   or for other people who are driving with me.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:27.080]   So yeah, I mean, it was about a year of planning.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.280]   And then we got the car and then we spent a month
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.160]   just tearing it apart and trying to make it.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.400]   I was so set.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:38.000]   I really wanted the car just for its function.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000]   And I was like, I'm so fine with if it's really ugly.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.200]   But then we managed to make it actually look really good.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.760]   - So that wasn't part of the discussion,
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.600]   like how the final thing looks?
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.320]   - I wasn't that fussed about it.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.760]   I was like, I just want it for its function.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.520]   Like I really want this car.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.040]   I don't want it because it looks cool.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.920]   But then it ended up looking pretty cool as well.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:04.480]   And I'm really, I mean, even now a couple of years later
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.360]   when there are some more options of electric pickup trucks,
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.120]   I still stand truck law.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   Like she's like Rivian, Ford F-150,
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.280]   like they're all great, but they're giant.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:24.280]   - You're sitting there on the porch in your cowboy hat.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.640]   - Yeah.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.080]   - Drinking whiskey and saying.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.240]   - With my cattle dog.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.080]   - Yeah.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:29.920]   - Yeah.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.640]   - No, I just want a small, I want like a small
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.920]   nineties pickup truck.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:35.960]   - Back to shitty robots.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.040]   You reuse parts of previous robots a lot.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.880]   What's like a memorable example of that?
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.360]   Is just the graveyard of parts?
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   - I mean, I've gotten better at keeping projects intact.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.800]   In the beginning I used to disassemble every project
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.560]   'cause I was also a much more stringent budget.
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.040]   So if I needed a motor, then I would like steal it off
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:59.000]   of an existing robot or a previous robot.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.120]   But I've gotten really good at not doing that now
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.240]   because I'm like, maybe one day I wanna have
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.920]   a museum exhibit and then it would be nice
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.840]   to have all of those machines intact
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.560]   and not having to rebuild them.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.880]   - Centuries from now, you can look
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.440]   at Benjamin Franklin's house.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.840]   - Oh yeah, no, we're just gonna look at my house.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.840]   - Yeah, just house.
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.340]   Some weird shit.
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:27.400]   - Yeah, that goes great with my idea of myself.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:31.040]   - With the autobiography, yeah.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.840]   You said that people keep requesting in the comments.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.320]   - That I put a dildo on it?
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.160]   - Yeah.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.120]   - Wait, was that actually what you were gonna ask?
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.680]   - Yeah, I have dildo written in my notes.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.440]   - I thought I just made it into a raunchy punchline.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.280]   - Dildo.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.280]   - You were actually gonna get there.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.560]   Yeah, that was in the early days, in the shitty robot days,
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.200]   but now I have a filter on my YouTube channel
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.480]   for every possible spelling of dildo.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.440]   - I mean, people want to probably sexualize robots, right?
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.840]   And then, or they put--
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:05.160]   - They wanna sexualize my relationship with them, yeah.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.000]   - Oh.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.840]   - You know, 'cause I have majority male followers,
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:14.840]   and they're so sweet and so respectful, 99%,
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.920]   but I realize there is a lot of...
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:23.880]   I've realized that society hasn't taught men
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.840]   how to have female role models,
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.240]   and the way that people channel it is through being like,
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:32.520]   "Oh, it's because I wanna fuck her,
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:35.320]   "or I wanna date her, or I wanna marry her."
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.280]   And I'm like, "I don't think you want any of those things.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.040]   "I think you actually just admire my work."
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:43.960]   But you don't know how to look up to a woman.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:46.640]   - Yeah, that's beautifully put.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.680]   What about weapons?
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.760]   Do you get requests to put weapons on a thing?
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.800]   - Yeah.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:53.200]   It's interesting, I kind of started in robotics
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.720]   as just like a happy camper
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.040]   who is really into tinkering,
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.040]   and now I'm kind of seeing some of the darker parts of it.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.760]   I remember first time I went to a proper factory,
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.600]   and I saw big industrial robot arms at work,
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.400]   and I was like, "Oh, wow, this is what it is about."
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.320]   And it was almost scary where I was like,
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.240]   "Oh, I've just been playing around
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.840]   "with these tiny versions of this."
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.880]   And I'm like, "Oh my God, everybody,
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.680]   "robotics is cool and fun."
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:21.720]   And then you get in there, and you're like,
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.080]   "This is kind of terrifying."
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.080]   - You were platforming the very things
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.040]   that will destroy human civilization.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.040]   You're making it fun and entertaining.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.840]   - I'm the mouthpiece, and I'm getting people
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.920]   into robotics and engineering,
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.520]   and we're all just building our demise
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.120]   and accelerating speed.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.280]   No, but I mean, I had that, and the same also
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.280]   with companies who are saying
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.240]   that they're never gonna put weapons on their robots,
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.840]   and then have military contracts and stuff like that.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.320]   And you're like, "This is dark and scary."
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.660]   Fortunately, I haven't gotten a lot of requests for it.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:01.880]   - Yeah, drones are terrifying, especially.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.640]   - Drones are fucking terrifying.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:07.600]   And it's really everything.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.760]   I mean, we humans are so good at creative ways
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.360]   of killing and fucking each other.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.600]   It's like almost how everything goes.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.160]   It's like, and it's, yeah, I'm terrified of the future
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.860]   where we are gonna use more robots to kill each other.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.880]   - And come up with new and new creative ways
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.040]   to kill and hurt each other.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.260]   Emotionally, psychologically, physically.
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:31.220]   - Yeah.
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:34.100]   - Speaking of which, what are your thoughts about,
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.900]   I don't know if you've been paying attention,
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.220]   but Chad GPT, the advancement in language models
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:40.440]   and artificial intelligence.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.940]   Have you added speaking capabilities to any of your devices?
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.440]   - I have Siri on, yeah.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.140]   I used to have an Amazon Echo in my house,
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:50.940]   but then I removed it.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:53.340]   It just freaked me out that I could whisper
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.380]   from my bed and it heard me.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:58.860]   I'd be like, Alexa, play Spotify.
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:00.780]   I'd be like, playing Spotify.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.740]   - Yeah. - Fuck.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.980]   (laughing)
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:10.140]   I think it is a powerful tool
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:12.540]   that we are not fully ready for.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.100]   - Yeah. - And I don't know.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:17.780]   I think the internet is kind of a parade
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:22.780]   of us using powerful things in harmful ways.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:27.820]   And I think chatbots are really, really exciting.
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:30.740]   I'm stoked to have a personal assistant
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.300]   that's like, or a virtual assistant
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.100]   that actually does a good job
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.340]   and can solve problems for me.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:39.900]   But yeah, it also feels like it can get dark
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:41.140]   really, really quickly.
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.380]   - Yeah, 'cause you can form close connections
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.580]   like we're talking about with it,
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:47.300]   and then it can be used to manipulate you.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.820]   Manipulate you in terms of what is true
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:54.380]   and manipulate you in terms of getting you to buy stuff.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.300]   - Yeah.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:57.780]   - Or maybe because at least for now,
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.780]   it's centralized, getting everybody to think the same way.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.540]   - I mean, it's the same in algorithms
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.100]   being used to radicalize people
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.140]   or kind of having that as a consequence
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.760]   of the way that they work
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.580]   and combine that with a really advanced language model.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.820]   And you can control people's world view
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:18.460]   in a way that you could.
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:21.540]   I mean, it's just, it's wild.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:24.180]   And I think we're not ready for it.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.380]   And I don't know if we ever would be
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:28.060]   because we're very impressionable,
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:30.700]   little squishy flesh bags.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.380]   - Which takes us back to the,
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:34.940]   when the squishy flesh bags interact,
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:36.060]   which one pops first?
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:36.900]   It's the um, bubble.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:37.740]   - Yeah, the bubble.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.940]   - We'll cut to this, the bubble wrap.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:42.060]   - Bubble, um, bubble, new paper coming out.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:42.900]   I like to read my paper.
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:44.420]   - What were we talking about?
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:47.900]   Oh, what about consciousness?
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:50.900]   So you never anthropomorphized the robots?
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:52.700]   Did they ever come to life for you?
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:55.700]   Where you kind of thought?
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.140]   - No, 'cause I built them and I know how they work.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.060]   - So that prevents you from being able to see the magic?
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.020]   - I don't know, yeah.
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.980]   But I think it's like,
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:06.980]   I definitely, when I did a lot of the shitty robot stuff,
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:10.180]   like I wanted them to move like a human
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.900]   or like in a more organic way
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:14.140]   and not just like point A to point B,
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:17.060]   which is the easiest way to program stuff.
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.700]   So I wanted other people to anthropomorphize them,
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:22.740]   but I don't think I did necessarily.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:25.420]   I'm trying to think of a piece of technology
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:30.100]   that I've kind of projected feelings upon, but no, I can't.
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.980]   - So sometimes what makes me anthropomorphize something,
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:38.580]   even though I built it, is there's a element of surprise.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.700]   So especially with machine learning,
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:43.580]   you're surprised by the kind of things it does.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.700]   Have you ever been surprised by a robot?
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.540]   - No, 'cause they're all pretty dumb.
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.060]   Like also the robots I built,
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:55.060]   it's like they're all just servos moving from,
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:59.740]   I mean, I don't think I've built anything
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:02.220]   with a huge amount of sensors
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.500]   or like they're just moving in a pattern
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.020]   that I programmed them to move.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.860]   - What's the most complex thing you've built?
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:11.500]   - I mean, probably a truck cloud.
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:12.340]   - Truck cloud.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:15.540]   - Yeah, was complex just for the sheer scale of it
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:20.140]   and like the, I mean, I think that was my biggest project,
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:21.980]   both in terms of build scope,
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.060]   but also in terms of impact that it had.
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.780]   Like that project just went wild.
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:28.900]   But then, yeah, then I don't know.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:31.380]   The bubble wrap music box, I don't know.
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:33.300]   They're all complicated in different ways.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.860]   - That one is epic.
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.420]   How does the bubble wrap connect to the flute, by the way?
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:39.380]   How does that work?
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.620]   - The flute is just right where,
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:45.180]   like mounted right where it pops it.
[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:46.100]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:48.820]   - So fascinating, I gotta watch that video.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.660]   - Yeah, that's fun.
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:55.660]   - Funny enough, in my deep investigative
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:58.300]   journalistic research of you,
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:00.940]   says you used to be an MMA reporter.
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:05.140]   How did that happen?
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:06.340]   How'd you get into it?
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:08.980]   - I was really into martial arts.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.700]   I was like a huge UFC buff.
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:14.300]   I mean, this is 2010, maybe.
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:16.020]   - Did you practice martial arts yourself?
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:16.980]   - I did, yeah.
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:18.380]   I was mostly standup.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:22.420]   I did a lot of Muay Thai and then some Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.660]   and just, yeah.
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:28.300]   I was really, the thing is I get really intense
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:32.300]   about my hobbies and I was so into it.
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.300]   I was all in. - Awesome.
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:38.740]   - And I had worked a little bit as a journalist
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:43.140]   and I was like, oh, I should do MMA reporting.
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:47.380]   And I emailed this MMA website in Sweden.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:48.980]   I was like, hey, can I come and write for you?
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:52.380]   And they were like, oh, actually we're going to an event
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.780]   in Gothenburg tomorrow, do you wanna come?
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.620]   - Yeah.
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.100]   - And I was like, wow, that's a lot.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.980]   It's like 11 p.m. at night, but sure, I'll come.
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.420]   And I went there to their office.
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:02.900]   I'd never really met them and I'm like,
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:03.780]   this is kind of scary.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:06.180]   Like I'm a 20-year-old girl and going there
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:07.940]   in a group of men, with a group of men.
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:11.260]   And they were so rude.
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:15.060]   I went there and I was like, hey, what's up?
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.660]   And they were all kind of ignoring me
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:20.060]   and just like not looking at me or interacting with me
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:24.660]   until they realized that Simon was a girl
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.340]   'cause we'd only talked over email.
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:30.140]   And they were like, oh, this guy named Simon is gonna come.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:32.460]   And then they were like, oh, fuck, Simon,
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:35.360]   it's actually Simone and it's a girl.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.780]   So I kind of like slid into that in a very,
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:41.180]   very strange way and I did that for a year.
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:43.060]   But then I got kicked out of an interview
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.020]   with Alexander Gustafsson.
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:46.580]   And I was like-- - Wow, your pronunciation
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:47.420]   is so good.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:48.820]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.620]   And then I just kind of never went back
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:51.540]   and I was done with it.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:53.220]   And now I'm not allowed to do martial arts
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:54.500]   because of brain stuff.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:57.940]   So I've kind of put all of that behind me.
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:58.940]   And it's interesting.
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:03.300]   It's like I definitely see the athleticism in it
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.460]   and the skill that goes into it.
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:08.820]   I think as the older I get, the more concerned I am
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:10.740]   about the health impacts of the sport.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:13.980]   And of the people who are practicing it on an elite level.
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:16.020]   And I'm just not as,
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:22.500]   cannot as 100% just cheer as somebody
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:24.820]   beats somebody else up into a pulp.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.500]   - Yeah, especially considering the effects
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.140]   it might have on the brain.
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:32.180]   May I ask why you got kicked out
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:34.380]   of the Gustafsson interview?
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:35.820]   Was anything fun?
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:36.660]   Was it embarrassing?
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.100]   What happened? - No, it wasn't.
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:41.540]   I didn't, it was not, I didn't intend to get kicked out.
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:43.140]   I didn't realize I was gonna get kicked out.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:47.380]   So it was, Alexander Gustafsson was gonna fight John Jones.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:51.780]   And he had just, he was kind of like this golden boy
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:53.060]   in Sweden.
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.540]   And he had just come out to the press
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:44:00.540]   that he had actually been to jail for violent crimes.
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.940]   And all I wanted to ask, all I asked was,
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.900]   what was the reason that you wanted
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.700]   to bring that forward now?
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:11.420]   And apparently that was completely like blacklisted,
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:13.380]   but I hadn't gotten briefed about it at all.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:18.380]   And the PR man, head of PR of the UFC
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:21.820]   was just yelling at me and they kicked me out
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:24.580]   of Grand Hotel in Stockholm.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:27.980]   And I immediately called my mom and I was like,
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:30.140]   "Mom, you will not believe what just happened.
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:33.180]   "I got kicked out of an interview at Grand Hotel."
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:38.100]   Because in the '90s, she got kicked out of an interview
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:40.660]   with Mel Gibson from the Grand Hotel.
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:42.580]   So that's like, runs in the family.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:43.420]   So I was just like, it was so--
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:44.660]   - Was she proud of you?
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.060]   - Yeah, no, it was just this weird generational skip
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:51.460]   where we both gotten kicked out of interviews
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.320]   at the same hotel.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.940]   - You spent quite a bit of time in China as a student.
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:59.020]   Is that something you could speak to,
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:02.140]   the differences culturally?
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.740]   Maybe even from like a student in engineering perspective
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:07.220]   between China and US, maybe even Sweden.
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:09.060]   Those are like technologically speaking,
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:11.380]   just such fundamentally different places.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.940]   - I mean, I moved to China when I was 16
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.700]   and I went through as an exchange student.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:19.620]   So that is before I had ever touched upon those things.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:24.620]   And it was, and then I went back when I was 19
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:28.060]   to work as an English teacher for a little bit.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:33.060]   So it was incredibly challenging to be there.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:37.260]   - The language barrier, the language, the culture.
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.380]   - All of it.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:41.140]   I mean, I was like now when I look at 16 year olds,
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.780]   I'm like, you're a baby.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:46.460]   And I moved, sorry, 10 to 16 year olds listening to this.
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:49.700]   But like, I just can't believe I did that.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.160]   And yeah, I didn't speak the language.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.540]   I got placed in like a small city with almost no foreigners.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:57.780]   It was just a constant audience of people staring at you
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.500]   because they haven't interacted
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.500]   with a lot of foreigners before.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:05.540]   And yeah, it definitely,
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.440]   and then after that I moved to Kenya.
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:12.060]   And I think that was one of the reasons
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.700]   why it was so interesting to move to the States
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:17.060]   because people were like, oh, isn't it like hard
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.340]   with the language barrier or the cultural difference?
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:22.340]   And I was like, this is nothing.
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.020]   And I could speak the language,
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:25.180]   like I could speak English well
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:27.320]   and I could kind of pass as an American,
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:28.660]   even just as I moved here.
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.020]   And it was such a relief where I was like,
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.500]   wow, I'm like an undercover foreigner.
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.940]   Because I got to a point where I realized
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.820]   like it doesn't matter how good my Mandarin is,
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:41.820]   I'm never, people are never gonna fully accept me here.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:44.460]   So yeah.
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.780]   - And you moved, you went to Kenya,
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:49.740]   you've spoken about this after your parents got divorced.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:50.900]   - Yeah.
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.740]   When did I talk about that?
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.860]   Didn't realize I told that story.
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:55.940]   - I know, I know so many things.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:56.780]   What do you think this is?
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:59.460]   - Is it from when I have my Amazon Echo installed?
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:00.300]   - Yeah.
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:04.460]   - Yeah, so I came home from China first time,
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:05.740]   I was there for a year.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:12.780]   It's one of the most turned upside down days of my life.
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:15.900]   I spent a year there and I was so excited.
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:18.540]   I had a really rough year and I was so excited
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:21.260]   just to come home and like be a child again.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:24.340]   I remember thinking and just like feeling like I belonged.
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:29.340]   And then I came home and I found out that my parents
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:32.100]   had separated when I was gone and they hadn't told me
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:34.700]   because they wanted to like not affect my stay there,
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:37.980]   which I think was 100% the right decision of them to make.
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:40.860]   But I kind of came home to a house
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:43.220]   that was starting to get picked apart and--
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:45.940]   - It's a big shock to your world.
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.780]   - It was both yes and no.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:51.780]   I think I remember I just sat down on my bed
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:55.140]   and I was like, well, this isn't what I expected,
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:57.180]   but I guess I'll move to Kenya
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:58.860]   because that was one of the few,
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:01.060]   there were a few Swedish boarding schools in the world.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:03.380]   There was one in Brussels, Paris, London,
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:05.380]   and then one in Nairobi.
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:06.660]   And I didn't wanna miss more school
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:09.540]   because I'd taken a gap year when I went to China.
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:12.220]   So I was like, I guess I'll go to Nairobi.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:13.060]   And I'm thinking now,
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:15.660]   like I think if my parents had stayed together,
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.780]   granted, it was amazing that they did made
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:19.740]   the right decision in every way,
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:23.660]   but my roots kind of never grew back after that.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:29.620]   And I think I just kept on moving abroad and moving around
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:33.860]   and being really restless and yeah.
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:36.860]   - Have you ever been able to find a home spiritually?
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:38.460]   - I have a home, yeah.
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:43.460]   I mean, I have a home in the people around me
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:46.140]   and I have a lot of different homes.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:49.860]   I think what I'm realizing more and more
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:53.380]   is like you cannot live without consequence and compromise.
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:55.540]   And sometimes I can envy people
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:57.540]   who have that like same friend group
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:59.180]   that they had their entire life
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:03.780]   or that just really belong in a place.
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.980]   And I realized that would be amazing,
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:10.260]   but I've chosen different experiences.
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:12.260]   And one of the upsides of that
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.060]   is I can feel home almost anywhere.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:16.540]   One of the downsides of that
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:19.660]   is that I cannot feel fully at home anywhere.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:24.100]   - Wow, that's deeply and darkly poetic.
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:25.180]   - Do you feel at home?
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:34.580]   - Probably the way you put it is really beautifully put.
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:41.260]   No, I have to find home in the people I love.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:42.340]   - Yeah.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.340]   (sighs)
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:49.260]   What advice would you give to young people
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:53.220]   that look at your stellar life,
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.940]   the trajectory of your career as a human being,
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.940]   as a creator, as a engineer, as a designer,
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.740]   as a incredibly interesting personality
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:09.860]   who's working on an autobiography?
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.700]   What advice would you give them?
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:14.580]   Like how to make their way in this life?
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:17.300]   Maybe high school students, maybe college students
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.580]   on how they can have a career they can be proud of
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.340]   or a life they can be proud of.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:23.340]   - Oh my God, Lex.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:28.940]   You know, this is not the advice,
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:31.420]   but there are very few moments in a career
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:34.420]   that feel as good as you think they are going to.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:36.020]   And there are very few moments
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.740]   of feeling really proud of yourself.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:41.540]   Like I feel like I often just feel like
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:43.460]   I'm not doing it well enough or big enough,
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:46.380]   or I know I just had one of those moments
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:47.220]   like hearing you say that.
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:49.780]   I'm like, oh, I'm actually doing okay.
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:58.900]   I think my main advice is enthusiasm
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:02.660]   is a much more potent fuel in life than duty.
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:05.380]   And just because something is boring
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.380]   doesn't mean that it's important.
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:10.500]   I kind of realized for myself
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.900]   that like I'm so much better at the things I enjoy,
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:17.260]   but school doesn't really teach us
[01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.580]   how to stay excited about something
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:21.420]   and how to stay enthusiastic about something.
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:22.820]   And if you can find that,
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:27.180]   then like you got a gold mine of potential.
[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:31.700]   So I kind of had to reprogram myself to be like,
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:32.940]   just because this is fun
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:34.780]   doesn't mean that it's not important.
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:39.420]   Because I had so much guilt about it in this weird way
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.940]   or where I'm like, no, this is too fun.
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:41.780]   This can't be work.
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.940]   And I'm like, no, it's still work.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:45.900]   The boring stuff isn't more important.
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.700]   - And the vice versa, as you said,
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:52.380]   just because it's boring and hard
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:54.460]   doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:55.460]   That's interesting.
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:59.180]   I'm gonna have to take that advice and think through it.
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:01.580]   'Cause genetically I'm built a little bit
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:03.540]   like if this is really unpleasant,
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:04.860]   it's probably good for me.
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:08.020]   And it's a dangerous thing to think.
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:10.020]   Sometimes it's true, sometimes it's not.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:13.980]   - No, and it's like, what comes really easy
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:18.220]   and where do you have that kind of effortless momentum
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.340]   and enthusiasm?
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:22.140]   And that is kind of the sweet spot.
[01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:24.420]   I think that I'm also really happy
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:28.500]   that I spent time trying out so many different jobs.
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.300]   I mean, I've had so many different jobs before I did it
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:33.900]   and I would do things for a year and then I quit.
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:37.020]   And it feels like I tried on a bunch of different pants
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:39.340]   and you're like, okay, I can kind of wear this,
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:40.940]   but they're not super comfortable
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:43.060]   or I don't love the look of them or whatever.
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:45.300]   And now I feel like I found this pair of pants
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.700]   that just fits me perfectly
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:53.380]   and that perfectly caters to my strengths and my weaknesses.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:56.380]   Like I used to work as an editor for the Swedish government.
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:00.140]   And I remember thinking like,
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:03.300]   oh, I need to be okay that not a lot of things are happening
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:04.820]   and that things are moving slowly
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:07.780]   and that the work is kind of like monotonous.
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.980]   And then I realized like,
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:10.700]   or maybe I should be in a workplace
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:14.540]   where it's a benefit or strength
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:15.940]   that I want a lot of things to happen
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:18.580]   and that I can handle a high speed.
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:23.060]   And I think that is really such a good question task as well.
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:24.980]   Like what are my strengths, what are my weaknesses
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.740]   and in what context are most of these things strengths?
[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:31.940]   - And if you know that, if you know the measurements,
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:33.540]   you can find the right fitting pants.
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:37.100]   - Yeah, or the right suit as Lex will tell you.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.580]   - What do you think is the meaning of life?
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.940]   - Oh, I don't think there's any meaning.
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:44.740]   - It's a meaningless void?
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:46.500]   - No, that it doesn't have any meaning
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.180]   doesn't mean that it's meaningless.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:50.740]   I don't think that there's this big grand meaning.
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.140]   I think a more important question
[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:58.140]   is what brings you substantial joy in your life.
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.780]   To me, it's the relationships with people that I have.
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.740]   - Love?
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.420]   - Yeah, I mean, love in all different kinds of form.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:10.300]   I'm really working on figuring out
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.660]   how to build more community,
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:15.260]   especially in a society that isn't really made for it.
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:21.980]   I want more passive hangouts with people
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.580]   where like, I just want people who are there.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:27.140]   - Together?
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:27.980]   - To get high?
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:28.820]   - Maybe to get high.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.660]   - Together, yeah.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:32.660]   I mean, I think seeing somebody for lunch
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:33.780]   and kind of shooting the shit
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:37.300]   and what's the latest with you is great.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:41.300]   But what I want is somebody to just roll up in sweatpants
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.940]   and open my fridge and be like, "What are you gonna do?
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:46.700]   I don't know, maybe I'll read a book."
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.220]   Like, yeah, I think that--
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:50.020]   - Sharing kind of like silence.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:52.940]   - Sharing silence, being alone together,
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.060]   and just that type of community.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:57.060]   - Yeah, I think that's a great question.
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:58.620]   That type of community, I think,
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:01.740]   is what I'm really seeking out now.
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:05.140]   'Cause I think, yeah.
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:08.580]   And also like working on a goal,
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:11.060]   on a joint goal together with other people.
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:13.380]   I think being a YouTuber can be really lonely.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:17.460]   I mean, as much as I'm working with a team, it's like,
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:20.700]   yeah, I just wanna work in a bigger project
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:23.020]   and kind of have that sense of,
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:24.620]   wow, we're like doing this together.
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:29.220]   'Cause I think that accesses my pride a lot better
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:30.620]   than just being proud of myself.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:33.980]   It's so much easier for me to be proud of a team
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:37.220]   than for me to be proud of myself.
[01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:38.700]   - That's probably good advice for people
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:40.620]   who are doing creative work on YouTube,
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:43.780]   to work on a team.
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:47.060]   - Yeah, and just choose, try to do things,
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:49.140]   take it from the queen of shitty robots,
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:51.340]   but like try to do things with integrity.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:52.860]   Former queen of shitty robots.
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:55.300]   Do things with integrity.
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:57.860]   Like anything you do on the internet is kind of,
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:00.700]   I think of things as tattoos on my internet
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:02.340]   and on my internet self.
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.100]   And I'm really happy that I said no
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:06.740]   to some things early in my career
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:08.300]   that I know that I would have regretted now.
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:11.740]   And just think of it in the longterm.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:16.460]   Like going viral is overwhelming
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:21.220]   and so stressful and so fun, but like so intense.
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:25.060]   And I'm really happy that I managed to build that
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:28.140]   into a more longterm career
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:30.940]   than just have it be something that passed.
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:34.580]   - And come down from the viral moment
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.100]   and maintain your humanity.
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:41.100]   - Yeah, and also really deliberately defining
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:43.460]   what success means to you.
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:46.940]   Because there are so many reasons
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:50.020]   or so many definitions that other people will give you.
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:51.700]   And especially when you're working on the internet,
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:53.980]   there are just numbers upon numbers that are like,
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:56.300]   you're doing well, you're not doing well.
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:00.100]   And something I'm really happy that I did was early on,
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:01.580]   I really tried to think of like,
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:03.740]   what does success look like for me?
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:07.620]   And I realized that it's not having
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.740]   the world's biggest YouTube channel.
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:13.940]   It's being proud of the projects that I put out
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:18.740]   and having full say in how I spend my time.
[01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:20.940]   Like that is the most important thing to me.
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:23.260]   And if I had a huge YouTube channel
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:25.100]   and I was making so much money,
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:27.820]   but I kind of had this machine run me
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:29.340]   rather than the other way around,
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:32.020]   like to me, it's so important to be able to wake up
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:34.820]   in the morning and be like, I don't wanna do this anymore.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.380]   And for that to be okay.
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:40.700]   And I think I defined that for myself early on
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:42.060]   and I've really tried to live by it
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:44.580]   and made decisions after that.
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:46.500]   And I'm really happy that I did that.
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:49.700]   - And also you're with the store,
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:51.660]   with the design you're doing now,
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:54.540]   you're putting a little bit of love
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:56.380]   in the products that create a scale.
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:58.140]   I mean, that's what Johnny Ive did.
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.220]   That's the cool thing.
[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:02.180]   So you can create something beautiful
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:05.960]   and then people can share that love at scale.
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.360]   - It's terrifying and beautiful and I'm so here for it.
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:10.500]   - I'm here for it too.
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.140]   I'm a big fan.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:14.380]   I'm a big fan of who you are.
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:15.780]   I'm a big fan of everything you do,
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:16.900]   of putting yourself out there,
[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:18.540]   putting your love out there
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.900]   in terms of the designs you create.
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:22.740]   Also just because I'm a fan of robotics,
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:24.220]   I think you inspire a lot of people.
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:28.300]   I think the shitty robots are actually incredible robots
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.940]   and it's incredible engineering.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:34.780]   That's the best combination of design and engineering
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:36.580]   and fun, all of it together.
[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:38.580]   So thank you for doing that.
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.500]   I'm a big fan, you're an inspiration
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:41.940]   and thank you for sitting down with me.
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:42.780]   This is awesome.
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:44.980]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:47.700]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Simone Giertz.
[01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.820]   To support this podcast,
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:51.420]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:54.580]   And now let me leave you with some words from Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:58.780]   We have to continually be jumping off cliffs
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.340]   and developing our wings on the way down.
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:04.900]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:10.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:20.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
