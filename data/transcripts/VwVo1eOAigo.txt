[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   Whether you want to learn your first language or you're starting on your fifth,
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.120]   we've got all the hacks you need to be fluent in three months.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.240]   And that's because I'm talking with none other than the world's best
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.640]   on the topic, Benny Lewis.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.440]   By the end of this episode, you'll leave with a practical approach to learning
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.520]   a new language better, faster, and much more efficiently.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.080]   So hit that thumbs up and subscribe to the channel.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.160]   If you enjoy this video, let's jump in.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   Benny, I'm so jealous you're joining from South Korea.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.480]   Thank you for being here.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.240]   Yeah, it's a pleasure. Thanks for having me.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.920]   To kick us off, I want to understand, you know, coming from the States,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.120]   I feel like there just aren't as many people interested
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.400]   in learning a language as I wish there were.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.280]   And I'm curious what you think some of the common challenges
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.800]   or misconceptions there are that might be holding people back.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.280]   Well, I myself had the misconception
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.560]   because I didn't grow up speaking other languages.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.840]   I would. Oh, I was only speaking English when I was 21.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200]   I actually studied electronic engineering.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.840]   So I definitely understand coming from the background of
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.760]   I'm not good at languages, especially if you go into a technical field.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   It's very tempting to get this whole left brain, right brain concept
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   in your mind where you're either good at technical things,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.000]   like I was good at mathematics and the sciences.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.840]   And then I decided because of that, I'm bad at the arts and languages.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.360]   And I created a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.360]   I would see failure and I would see I would say to myself and to others,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.760]   that's proof that I am destined to never learn a language.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.480]   And I could list a million examples of where I failed an exam in school
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.960]   or even moved to Spain after I graduated.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   And I lived there for six months and I did not learn Spanish
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.480]   for those six months.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.960]   So I totally understand coming from a monolingual English
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.240]   country that you just think to yourself
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.320]   that I don't have the language gene.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.520]   Other people have it.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.920]   I don't have it or I did not grow up speaking a language.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.200]   So it's too late.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.560]   I'm past whatever the cutoff age is for learning a language.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.400]   And a lot of people say these things to themselves.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.480]   And that truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.840]   The more you embrace these reasons that you're going to fail,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.720]   the more you essentially make them true.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.560]   And I always like to think what Henry Ford said once,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.680]   whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.560]   And I think that's very true with language learning.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.320]   And what changed for you after those first failed six months living in Spain?
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.520]   I was telling myself more and more.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.680]   It was just giving me more fuel for this.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.360]   You're you suck at languages fire.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.120]   And one of the things that challenged that was I was telling myself
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.240]   the technical thing, you're an engineer.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.040]   Engineers don't learn languages.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.800]   But I was on this exchange program that had a lot of other engineers
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.680]   coming into Spain and they would arrive not speaking any Spanish.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.160]   But after a few months, a lot of them would actually be speaking
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.600]   some level of Spanish.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.960]   So this challenge, this belief that I had.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   And so I decided to experiment.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.640]   And I tried a few things and a lot of them were huge flops.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.560]   And that's another thing that I know a lot of your listeners,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.960]   perhaps in the past, have attempted to learn a language.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.800]   And it was a failure.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.560]   And they just kind of say, that's proof that I'm just destined to never speak it.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.840]   And so I had a lot of those failures beyond the failures in school.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760]   While I was living in Spain, I went to a group class and I was worse than the class.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.600]   The teacher would turn to me, ask me a question, and I would say,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.600]   I see no and hope maybe maybe that's right.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.640]   And it was never right.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.760]   She was asking me how old you are or whatever.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.880]   And what I had to do was keep experimenting
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.320]   and keep failing until I found an approach that works for me.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.280]   And I am absolutely convinced that there is nobody in the entire world
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.640]   that cannot learn a second language.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.080]   But what is true is there are many approaches
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.520]   that are completely inefficient for a lot of people.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.440]   And in my case, the academic approach of learning,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.840]   like I did in school, sitting in a classroom with 30 other people
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.520]   and having a teacher talk at us, that just does not work for me.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.840]   And in that environment, I am a terrible language learner.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.640]   So I think it's OK for people to say using this particular approach,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.240]   I am a bad language learner.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.440]   But that does not mean you will never learn a language.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.600]   Maybe you need to find that approach.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.440]   And so what happened was after all these failed experiments
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.960]   of multiple attempts to learn language in ways that did not work for me,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.120]   my last experiment was, OK, I'm going to try and just speak Spanish
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.720]   all the time outside of my work because I was teaching English.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.480]   So obviously I had to speak English.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.720]   But as soon as I walked outside the door of the school,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.640]   I would only speak Spanish and my Spanish was absolutely abysmal.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   This was caveman Spanish of like barely a few dozen words.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I decided to use it anyway.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.840]   And I pushed through this extremely frustrating stage.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.040]   And there's literally a moment that everything changed for me
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.400]   was when I was still kind of broke at the time.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.320]   And I just bought an electric toothbrush and it broke on me.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.880]   And I was so mad about it.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.880]   I wanted a refund.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.640]   So I charged into the the shop that I had bought it in ready to demand
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.560]   my money back.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.040]   And then I realized when I went up to the manager,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.360]   I don't know how to say refund.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.000]   I don't know how to say toothbrush.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.680]   I don't know how to say broken.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.760]   So I was like, uh, machina, the dentist is malo.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.840]   Tooth machine bad.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   Dinero y de vuelta.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.520]   Money round trip.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.960]   And, you know, it was absolutely wrong to like
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.320]   if I was sitting an exam in an academic context,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   I would have failed this.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.360]   Try to ask for a refund for a toothbrush test.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.880]   But you know what?
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.520]   I got my money back and that just blew my mind
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.320]   that maybe I don't need to be perfect in Spanish
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.400]   or I don't need to have a high level in Spanish.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.720]   I just need to communicate.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.080]   And I think that's something that a lot of people could embrace
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.560]   is this idea of instead of thinking that every mistake you make
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.640]   is a big red X on an exam paper, bring you closer to a fail.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.160]   Every mistake is just you trying to communicate.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.440]   And the gauge of success is, are you understood?
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.400]   And do you get the gist of what they're saying back to you?
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.160]   And this is a lot more nebulous and leaves a lot more room
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.520]   for you to have some form of success.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.840]   And once I saw that, I started to lower the bar
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.000]   on what counts as for success.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.440]   And that gave me a lot of wins to push my Spanish forward.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.520]   And I think a lot of people, they have their head a bit too much
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.800]   on this very distant long term goal that you want to master the language.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.560]   And I have reached that stage.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.360]   I have a C2 diploma in the likes of Spanish.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.200]   I worked as a professional translator, so I have reached this high level stage.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.320]   But when I'm in language learning mode,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.400]   I decide to embrace the fact that I'm a beginner.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.120]   Try to have fun with it.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.680]   Try to accept my limitations and just decide my goal
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.560]   is to make a lot of mistakes.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.480]   And that's how I'm going to make progress.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.360]   And that completely transformed my entire language learning life.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   It's funny, I haven't had to learn a language since the learning
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.640]   a similar lesson in a different way.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.280]   But we've had three au pairs stay with us
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.360]   speaking Spanish, Spanish and Italian.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.840]   And I don't speak Spanish or Italian.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.640]   And so they were kind of forced.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.080]   They have more English knowledge than than we did in other languages.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:04.920]   And as a person on the other side of this, when someone says something wrong,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.600]   you don't think, oh, my gosh, this person got it all wrong.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.400]   You just communicate.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.880]   And when someone says, like, take car school, it's like, OK, well,
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.040]   you know what they're saying.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.800]   It's completely grammatically maybe incorrect, but it doesn't matter.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.640]   And I've watched three people just their English constantly improves
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.360]   without me teaching them, without me teaching them lessons.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.880]   They're just hearing my responses.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.120]   And so I haven't tried to pick up a language since having them here.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.000]   But it's made me a lot more confident
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.720]   than I think that perfection is a bug I had.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.640]   And that probably comes from school, right?
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.320]   Failing tests because I didn't know specific words or gosh,
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.880]   the number of times learning French messing up on the gender of a word.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.440]   It felt like that was the only thing I was trying to learn was conjugation
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.320]   and gender, but I'm not even convinced you need them well
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.720]   to communicate at a basic level.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.640]   No, you know, you don't, because like you said, people are flexible
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.920]   and you do learn those things.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.160]   So it's not like I'm saying, make these mistakes.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.880]   And a lot of people would say, what about fossilization?
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.520]   The mistake will stay with you forever.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.480]   It doesn't.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.160]   You'll practice and eventually you'll you'll find tricks
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.080]   that work for remembering conjugation and remembering
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.280]   what the gender of certain nouns are.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.120]   You start to internalize those things, but they're less important at the start.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.680]   And it's like you said, people have this idea of like the spotlight,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.960]   the spotlight effect.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.320]   Everyone is looking at me.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.760]   Everyone is judging me.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.000]   And whenever I try to speak the language, they're all laughing
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.600]   at how much of an idiot I am because I use the wrong conjugation.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.480]   That's not how the real world works.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.680]   Most people are patient.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.880]   Most people want you to succeed.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.680]   And if you say a broken sentence that gets the point across,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.400]   but is grammatically incorrect, you're not talking to to a computer
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.160]   that's going to spit out an error message.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.480]   You're talking to a human being and they're going to understand you
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.920]   and they're going to interpret what you're saying.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.200]   And the conversation will move forward.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.920]   And this perfectionism does not work in the language,
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.360]   in the context of languages.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.000]   And it's unfortunate because languages are exposed to us
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.600]   in an academic situation at first.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   That's our context is it is an academic thing.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.360]   Every mistake you make is a problem.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.240]   But in the real world, I like to think languages can't be learned for real.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.680]   Languages can only be lived.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.600]   And this is the attitude I try to take to it.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.120]   I try to think of it more like a sport that I'm practicing
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.400]   and getting better at, where, you know, if you're doing any kind of sport,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.600]   you're not going to get punished if you don't have a perfect game on day one.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.800]   That's not how it works.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.280]   You get better progressively with time.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   And I think it's a lot better to think of languages in that context
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.440]   rather than academically, because perfectionism is the worst enemy
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.320]   of all in language learning.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.640]   It will absolutely defeat any sense of progress you're going to make.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   It's going to destroy your ego.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.840]   You have to let go of your ego a lot in language learning and decide.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.320]   I sound like an idiot right now, and I'm OK with that.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.120]   And I it's very humbling.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.920]   And I do it over and over again.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.280]   I'm doing it right now with Korean, and it's kicking my ass again.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.480]   Even though I have a high level in other languages, I'm an idiot once again.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.760]   And because I'm OK with being an idiot, that's why I can learn the languages.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.800]   First off, I think there are probably some people listening right now
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.920]   that are like, wow,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   maybe I actually do know enough Spanish or French or German
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.240]   or whatever I picked up in school to actually use it.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.400]   So if you're if you're that person, I'm excited for you.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.120]   I hope you get a chance to forget a lot of these things.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.280]   I definitely want to talk more about, you know, the practice
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.560]   of picking up a language for people who haven't even started.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.640]   But I know there's a kind of common belief that adults
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.960]   are not as good as language learners as children.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.000]   Do you think there's any kind of age limit to this or something like that?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.320]   So this comes back to what I was saying before about approach.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.360]   The approach dictates how successful you're going to be.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.760]   And when I was researching this a long time ago,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.440]   I came across a study in the University of Haifa in Israel
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.560]   that found that under the right circumstances,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.760]   adults are better language learners than children.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.880]   And that sounds very counterintuitive because all the evidence we see out there
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.200]   is what children are clearly learning languages more than adults are.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.280]   And that is because it's not under the right circumstances for those adults.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.160]   The adults are taking dusty old grammar books.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.120]   The adults are going to group classes where they're kind of zipping it
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.040]   and letting a teacher talk at them.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.560]   The adults are not truly living through the language.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.800]   The adults don't have any friends in the language.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.320]   They're not playing games in the language like a child does.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.120]   And a child has a better language learning approach.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.800]   It's not that they are better at language learning.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.920]   And, you know, it's you could argue both points.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.720]   You could argue why children are better.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.880]   They have more neuroplasticity and their brains are open to more things.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.440]   But ultimately, there are a lot of advantages adults have.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.160]   We have complete control for the most part over our days, over our lives.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.920]   We can decide where we're going, what are what we're doing with our free time.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.080]   A lot more than a child can.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.640]   So a child may learn a language, but a child cannot decide.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.320]   I want to learn Chinese.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.920]   That's not going to happen for that child unless the parents decide, OK,
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.680]   I'm going to help you do that.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.760]   I'm going to put you in the right environment or whatever.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.560]   So we have a lot more control over the situation.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.840]   But I understand there are there's a lot of baggage that comes with things.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.440]   And as an adult, letting go of that baggage is very difficult.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.320]   That will slow us down.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.840]   So there is a certain mental hill that you have to climb
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.040]   that does make it harder for adults.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.840]   And I think a lot of us have fallen into this perfectionist trap.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.480]   And that makes it harder because children are not perfectionists.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.080]   When you think of any child learning their native language,
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.680]   they make a million mistakes and they're fine with it.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.400]   And I think that's we can take inspiration from children.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.480]   But absolutely, there is no cutoff age.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.360]   There is no age where you cannot learn a language.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.160]   The only thing you'll find when you dig really deep into this is maybe
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.880]   there's an age where it becomes a lot more difficult to become bilingual.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.240]   And that's another problem.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.040]   And that is absolutely a problem you may want to solve or try to solve.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.680]   But honestly, who cares?
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.360]   I am not bilingual in any of my languages.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.400]   I am at a mastery level.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.840]   So I can do everything I can do in English.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.160]   I can do in Spanish.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.240]   But I still have an accent and I still make the odd mistake.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.520]   And there might be like an obscure word here or there that I don't know.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.360]   So I'm not bilingual.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.480]   You're not going to confuse me for a native speaker.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.640]   But I'm close enough that I can function like a native speaker would.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   And that's fine.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.320]   And maybe there's a there's an age where if I started learning Spanish
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.680]   before that, I could change that gap.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.120]   But who cares? It doesn't matter.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.360]   Like, I'm not trying to become a spy.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.480]   I don't want people to to think that I'm from Spain so I can fool them.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.720]   I'm from Ireland. I'm proud of I'm from Ireland.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.880]   If I've got a little bit of an accent, it's it has that sense of charm to it.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.000]   So I'm OK with not being bilingual.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.480]   And once you accept that,
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.920]   then this whole cutoff age becomes irrelevant.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.600]   So that's where the cutoff age is.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.560]   It's for bilingual fluency in a language.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.760]   And I have come across exceptions.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.800]   I have found adults who can become essentially the same as a native speaker,
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.200]   even though they learned it later in life.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.960]   But I wouldn't necessarily say that's something you could scale
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.200]   to a lot of other people easily.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.800]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.760]   The goal should be fluency.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.960]   If you can function the same in your target language like you would in English,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.360]   then that's all you ever need.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.480]   You're you're not going to try and be a spy.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.760]   That's not who cares about that.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.080]   Then you're you're good.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.400]   You're good with what you can do.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.280]   And that is something every adult in the world can absolutely do.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.880]   Given the caveat that there's there is a lot of work
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.560]   they have to do ahead of time in terms of mental changes
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.520]   and learning what the right approach is and so on.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.640]   So I want to come back to some of those mental changes.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.960]   But it just made me think of something right before I came to this interview.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   I told my daughter, who's only about to turn three.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.880]   I was like, oh, I'm going to go record a podcast.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.760]   So I'm going to miss your bedtime tonight.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.040]   And she goes, oh, it's like it's going to be about languages.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.480]   I was like, how many languages do you speak?
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.040]   She was like, I speak Italian.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.160]   I speak English and I speak Spanish.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.240]   And I was like, she maybe knows 50 words of Spanish and Italian.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.200]   But in her mind, she she speaks it.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.160]   And it just crossed my mind that I could probably speak
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.480]   thousands of words of French.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.960]   I could get along in the country by myself, no problem,
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.160]   but certainly not fluent, but I'm comfortable enough to to speak.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.840]   And I don't actually consider myself someone who speaks.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.480]   You know, it's like, oh, I wouldn't say I speak French like I can speak French.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.960]   So that confidence
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.360]   to to just feel like you're already there.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.800]   Are there any hacks or tips you've developed or helped people with
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.440]   to kind of get over those nerves and get over the need to be a perfectionist?
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.800]   Yeah, I mean, the probably the biggest hack, the biggest tip I can give
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:32.000]   of all to everybody is you have to speak your target language from day one.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.400]   So I think one big mental barrier people have is they decide
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.520]   I'm going to study the language for a certain amount of time.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.960]   Maybe that's a few months.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.320]   Maybe it's a year.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.480]   You know, I've made a New Year's resolution.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.760]   I'm going to learn Spanish.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.320]   So one year from now, I will have reached that magic moment
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.760]   when I can finally walk up to a native speaker and speak Spanish to them.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:00.640]   And I think that is a fool's errand, because this creates a new situation
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   in your head where you have to wait until you're ready
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.040]   and then you can make all the excuses in the world that you're not ready yet,
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.560]   because you will never be at 100 percent perfectionism in Spanish.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.240]   Even when you reach the very high levels I've talked about,
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.160]   there's still a couple of little things you need to polish.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.360]   So if you decide if you are enough of a perfectionist,
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.560]   you would never speak your target language.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.160]   So to throw that out the window, you have to decide,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.600]   I'm going to speak it right away, even though I only know 10 words.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.480]   I'm still going to try and use it.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.760]   So what I do.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.400]   So what, for instance, a couple of months ago, I started doing this with Korean.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.360]   On day one, I decided I am going to get somebody on Zoom,
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.200]   a native Korean speaker, and I'm going to speak only in Korean to them.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.880]   And this may obviously have a lot of questions like, how can you do that
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.320]   if you've literally just started to learn the language?
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.680]   So, yeah, I'll cheat. I'll cheat a little bit.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.960]   So what I'll do is I'll have a Google Translate tab open
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:05.120]   and I will ahead of the lesson, I'll try to find a few phrases
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.200]   I know I'm likely to use, like I'm from Ireland.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.400]   My name is and so on.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.520]   And then I'll say this to the teacher, the teacher will reply
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.960]   and I won't understand what they said.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   They'll say blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.800]   And one of the phrases I prepared is, I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.880]   Could you write that down, please?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.360]   And they'll write that in the chat.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.680]   And then I can copy and paste that into Google Translate.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.360]   So it is a giant crutch.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.800]   And, you know, obviously you could argue this doesn't really count
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.040]   as speaking the language.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.720]   But the point is that, you know, you use these crutches
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.640]   like you use a stabilizer on a bike.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.240]   It is giving you the ability to move forward,
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.280]   even though obviously you're not moving forward without a tool.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.000]   But with time, you'll need the crutch less and less.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.960]   You'll need the stabilizers on your bike.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.440]   You can take them off after you've learned how to get your balance and such.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   So that is my biggest tip by far, is let go of the fact
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   that you have to wait until you're ready and speak right now.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.240]   Decide I'm going to get in front of somebody.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.800]   And if you're paying for a teacher, and this is a lot more affordable
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.680]   than people think, people imagine I got to book a language class
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.560]   and they look in their hometown and they find the language class and it's expensive.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.160]   It's like 50 dollars an hour.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.200]   But they figure, no, it's worth the investment.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.880]   But the thing is, if you go on a lot of websites
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.200]   and you try to find a teacher who lives in the country,
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.480]   you know, with Spanish, who lives in literally any Latin American country,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.640]   you can take advantage of a stronger currency exchange
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.440]   and you can get a really good teacher for 10 or 15 dollars an hour
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.760]   who's earning pretty decently in their country.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.920]   And with that, you have one person
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.560]   who is giving their undivided attention to you.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.320]   And I decide ahead of time, I decided with my Korean teachers,
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.480]   I am paying this person for patience
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.600]   because I am going to be extremely slow.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.320]   I'm going to be incredibly awkward
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.800]   and I am paying this person to be patient with me.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.160]   So I don't have to feel as bad that I'm wasting their time or whatever,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   because I'm paying for their time.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.160]   And that takes a lot of the stress off me, because obviously
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.760]   I'm not going to walk up to a stranger on the street and start
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.000]   like blurting my low level of the language at them
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.080]   and expect anything positive to happen.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.960]   But when I'm paying for somebody's time, that's different.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.440]   So this is what I do is I try to hire a teacher online.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.080]   There's loads of good websites.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.480]   One that probably has the most teachers is italki, I-T-A-L-K-I dot com.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.720]   And you find a teacher there, you book them and you just start talking with them.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.960]   And it's going to suck.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.680]   You're going to feel like an idiot.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.400]   And the thing you have to remember
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.920]   is you have to suck a little less every day.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.880]   The goal is not perfectionism.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.280]   The goal is not to be a genius.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.040]   The goal is not to debate
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.240]   Kantian epistemology in your target language.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.720]   The goal is suck a little less every day.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   And that is essentially my biggest tip of all.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.880]   If you take anything from this interview, take that speak from the beginning.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.400]   You're going to suck.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.320]   Accept that. Embrace it.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.240]   And just suck a tiny bit less every day.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.120]   And that progressively leads to improvement.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.200]   I love it. I mean, it's very simple.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.720]   You have this whole program, you know, fluent in three months.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.800]   I'm also curious about where the three months came from.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.000]   So maybe you start with that.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.880]   But, you know, it has to be more than just continually have these conversations.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.160]   Are there steps along the way that someone should
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.480]   should follow learning a language and and maybe why three months?
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.360]   Yeah. OK, so the three months, it's a good question.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   I know when people would see the title fluent in three months, they may imagine
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.960]   I'm talking about a particular program that will guarantee success in three months.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.360]   But what it's more about is specificity.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.560]   So I'm not prescribing to anybody that you must do this within a certain timeline.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.400]   But the problem I tend to see is a lot of people are extremely vague
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.840]   with their targets, so they will make a New Year's resolution.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.520]   I want to learn Spanish.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.440]   And that's it. That's all they come up with.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.040]   And that has absolutely nothing attached to it.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   You need smart goals, specific, measurable, all that stuff.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.120]   So that's what I was thinking when I was getting started with all of this.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.400]   I needed to have a specific target in a specific deadline.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.240]   So in my case, three months happens to work because I'm a nomad.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.840]   So I travel all the time.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.000]   And when you travel, you will find a lot of countries
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.920]   tend to have a three month tourist visa limit.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.000]   So that's all the time I had.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.720]   So that's the deadline I was going to going to give myself.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.600]   Now, initially, I would travel to the country.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.080]   Nowadays, I do it differently.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.440]   Nowadays, I will learn the language ahead of time before going.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.800]   And then I'll go spend three months in the country
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.400]   without having to be in as intensive a learning mode.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.640]   And but ultimately, that's where it came from for me is it's a tourist visa limit.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.000]   And I find it's the Goldilocks zone where a year is just so much time
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   that you can keep putting it off and you can decide I'll do it once a week
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.040]   or whatever, and you might kind of cram it at the end.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.160]   Whereas a few weeks or a month is too little time to make
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.640]   any significant progress.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.400]   So three months of very intensive language learning.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.680]   If you're able to do that, if you're the kind of person who maybe can,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.880]   you know, work intensively for a particular time and take time off,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.160]   which I know is not the case for a lot of people.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.680]   But for me, that's what I would do is I would work really hard
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.440]   for nine months out of the year, save up money, and then I don't have to work
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.880]   so much for three months and I make it my full time job.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.480]   So that is not something I think is realistic for most people.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.280]   So I don't guarantee fluency in three months, because if you want to make
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.640]   any level, any really high level in a short amount of time,
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.600]   it needs to be a full time job.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.360]   But for most people, when you're doing it for you, try your best to decide,
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.600]   you know, for three months or for four months or six months, whatever it is.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.920]   I can make a lot of sacrifices.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.480]   I can decide I'm going to give up English speaking shows
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.880]   on Netflix for three months, going to take a break from those.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.040]   And the time I would put into watching those shows,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.760]   I'm going to study the language or the very least watch the shows
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.840]   in that language if I need to wind down or whatever.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.960]   And you decide, you know, I go out with my friends maybe three times a week.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.440]   I'm going to cut that down to once a week or once every two weeks.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.200]   And the extra time I'm going to put into learning the language,
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.640]   I'm going to make a lot of sacrifices in my life.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.760]   And those sacrifices are going to give me more time.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.440]   Even if that's one hour a day, you utilize that one hour and decide,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.840]   you know, I can't sustain this in the long term.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.560]   Eventually, I need to relax.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.480]   I need to be seeing my friends regularly, whatever it may be.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.080]   But you decide for this short term of three months or four months
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   or whatever specific number is realistic for you.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.240]   The biggest priority in my life is learning this language.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.640]   I'm going to eat and breathe this language.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.000]   I'm going to be listening to podcasts about the language.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.400]   I'm going to be reading books in the language, going to be using apps
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.440]   or doing flashcards in the language.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.840]   And of course, I'm going to be speaking the language
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.600]   with actual human beings via a Zoom call or whatever it may be.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.640]   And I'm going to do that intensively for a certain period of time.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.240]   That's going to make a difference, because a lot of people,
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.720]   they don't have any solid goals with their language.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.400]   They don't have any sense of intensity.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.720]   And they just try to do it in whatever free time they have,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.120]   like they're in a supermarket line and decide, I'll do some Duolingo.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.200]   And they've done something that day.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.400]   And then they say, oh, I've done something in the language.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.320]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.520]   You need to let go of this.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.400]   I'm going to do literally anything for five minutes
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.080]   and feel like I'm doing something in the language.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.920]   And it needs to be a true project.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.280]   So that's what I do.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.560]   I make it a project.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.680]   The three months works for me because
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.400]   it is an amount of time that I can throw myself out of project.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.040]   And like I start to run out of energy and then I'll go easy on myself
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.240]   the rest of the time.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.120]   And generally, because I deal with multiple languages,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.760]   I will learn a new language for three months.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.800]   But then I'll be maintaining my languages for the rest of the year.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.280]   And then I don't have to worry about learning a new language.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.000]   So it's an extremely intensive burst of progress.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.640]   And that's what I try to help people with.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.680]   And I run my own coaching program.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.760]   And of course, the coaching program goes over three months.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.800]   And it doesn't necessarily mean you have to have the same target as me.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.080]   But when people are on the coaching program, I at least guarantee
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.520]   by the end of it, you will be conversing in the language.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   And conversing is a lot more flexible than having to be fluent
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.880]   because conversing, you can still talk to someone who's patient
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.040]   and you can talk slowly and you can make a lot more mistakes.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.360]   So something like that, some specific goal that works for you
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.240]   that might be realistic, but still pushing yourself as much as possible.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.880]   That's what leads to a lot more success.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.520]   And that's what I see people not doing people who don't succeed
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.560]   in learning a language.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.720]   They don't have anything they're trying to reach in any timeline.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.360]   So smart goals changes everything.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.440]   And that's where the three months comes from.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   OK, so we set specific goals.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.760]   We set a time frame.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.440]   I like the idea of, you know, three months to get to fluency might be possible,
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.640]   but you've got to really be intensive.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.280]   But it sounds like and maybe maybe there's an hour a day.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   Or is there an amount of time that you think is the minimum
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.360]   someone needs to to put in to kind of even get to that conversational level?
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.400]   I think that's where you start to really see what is unique to the person.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.880]   I found for me, I can't make progress in a language
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.640]   unless I'm putting at least an hour a day in.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.720]   But I have come across a lot of people who actually can get it.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.840]   They can switch their brain into language learning very quickly
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.920]   and they can do something with 15 minute bursts.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.160]   And I've seen them progress over.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.760]   It's a longer period of time, obviously, but I have seen them progress.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.680]   So this depends on the person.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.960]   I'm not the kind of person that can do anything in 15 minutes.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.800]   It takes my brain time to adapt and like get used to it
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.560]   and get my momentum back.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.120]   So I personally need at least an hour.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.360]   And generally, I try to do a few hours because I'm I'm doing it intensively.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.840]   But I understand that's not as realistic for a lot of people
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.400]   in their life situations.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.400]   So depends on the person.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.160]   If you're the kind of person that feels like you can make genuine progress
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.120]   in a 30 minute window, that may be your minimum.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.080]   But of course, this is why I was saying before, the first thing you do
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.280]   is look at your timetable and see what can I sacrifice
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.080]   for these next two months or four months or whatever the number is
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.160]   and find more time.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.480]   So there's no magic number that like, you know, one hour
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.640]   is the number that's going to change your life.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.680]   Just find how much time you have, because the more time you do each day,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.080]   the more you're going to learn.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.920]   People always ask me how long will it take me to reach this level in language?
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.520]   And like, you know, they would say, Benny, your three months are crazy
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.120]   because I spent six years learning Spanish in school
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.800]   and I would interrupt them and say, no, you didn't.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.240]   You did not spend six years learning Spanish.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:50.760]   Six years elapsed through which you maybe went to a one hour
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.480]   Spanish class with people and you were daydreaming about a girl
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.160]   you had a crush on or whatever it is.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.760]   It's not quite the same as intensively like you are living
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.800]   and breathing this language for a certain period.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.400]   So it's why I tell people the amount of time that elapses
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.560]   is not what's important for counting how successful.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.080]   It's more about how many hours of dedicated time
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.520]   are you putting into that language where it's got 100% of your attention?
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:22.720]   Any less attention is going to give less important results.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.320]   So, you know, you can listen to a podcast while you're doing the dishes.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.720]   You can do something at the same time and it is going to help you,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.760]   but it's going to be less useful.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.520]   So I would say like an hour of listening to a podcast
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.320]   while you're doing other tasks is equivalent to maybe 10 minutes
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.360]   of actually giving it your undivided attention, replaying the audio,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.680]   taking notes.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.200]   So it's why it's a very nebulous thing to decide.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.800]   How much time do I need?
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.920]   Because it depends so much on how you're using that time.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.680]   So this is why I tell people, don't worry if you've spent six years or whatever.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.960]   I'm the same I spent in school.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.520]   I had learned a German for six years.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.760]   And at the end of those six years, I couldn't do anything.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.040]   I went to Germany and I couldn't order a train ticket.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.440]   And I was literally one of the things in my lessons
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.640]   that kept coming up, how to order a train ticket.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.040]   And I couldn't even do that.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.480]   So I say I say that I learned German for six years,
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.040]   but I didn't learn German for six years.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.240]   German learning happened in my schedule where I was in that class.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.640]   But it was in six years compared to three intensive months.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.920]   That is a whole different universe compared to what we think of
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.920]   for language learning in a very casual or passive way.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.360]   So you really need to take active control and it needs to be a priority in your life.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.560]   And then you could do a lot more in a shorter time period.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.600]   I love it.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.320]   So you mentioned the example of it's really important to start speaking early on,
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.520]   and there's ways that you could do it a lot more affordably.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.160]   And you also said, you know, it's really important how you spend the time.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   What are the things that are important to spend your time on aside
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.880]   from native speaking with someone, you know, another human?
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.680]   Is it vocabulary?
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.080]   Is it writing? Is it reading?
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.240]   What are the core elements in that?
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.320]   You know, let's call it three month period of what you need to be doing.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.640]   And I would definitely understand.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.760]   This is one of the first questions people ask me is what is the best app
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.360]   for learning a language and what are the best books I can buy?
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.920]   And what should I be doing with my time in terms of vocabulary and all that?
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.040]   And I have to say, I don't want to sound like a broken record,
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.080]   but the biggest thing you should be thinking about is speaking with a human being.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.560]   That should be the center of gravity for everything.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.280]   Everything else is incidental to that or anything else is building upon that.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:59.000]   So every day I try to have a lesson with a teacher or if I'm less intensive,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   maybe a couple of times a week, and then everything else that I'm doing
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.560]   is to augment that experience with my teacher.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.240]   So maybe after the class passes, I think to myself, man,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.480]   I really suck at vocabulary.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.520]   Then you have to do sort of a triage system.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.760]   You have to decide, like, you know, there's a million, you know,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.160]   you imagine a hospital where all these sick people are coming in.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.200]   There's a million problems to deal with.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.240]   But the guy with the runny nose is not as important as the guy with the gunshot
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.040]   wound. So you have to do this with your language learning.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.240]   And yes, of course, you could think, oh, my accent sucks.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.440]   Oh, my God, I'm not conjugating my verbs or I don't know
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.360]   the right gender of these nouns.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.440]   But none of that makes a big difference with actual communication.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:49.400]   I guarantee you when you're speaking languages and you mess up the gender
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.440]   like ninety nine point nine nine percent of the time,
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.640]   they will understand you regardless.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.760]   Like people always say, oh, but there's this one really specific example
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.080]   that if you switch the gender, it means something different.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.560]   That that doesn't happen, like almost ever.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.960]   For most cases, when you say in German instead of D or you say L
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.680]   instead of LA in Spanish, they understand what you mean.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.760]   So you have to start thinking of other things.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.880]   OK, basic vocabulary.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.160]   That's what I'm going to do in my my spare time.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.600]   Not because that's going to help me with some vague future
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.880]   of like generally improving my Spanish.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.360]   I'm a lot more short term sided and I'm thinking,
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.480]   what can I do to make my next experience tomorrow or next week?
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.800]   If that's my next class,
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.720]   what am I going to do to make that slightly better in the language?
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.400]   So maybe then I will learn some vocabulary.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   And I'm a big fan of using flashcards because they integrate
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.800]   the spaced repetition system into them.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.440]   So they space it out to make sure you're remembering the vocabulary
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.840]   just before you would potentially forget it.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.880]   For that, I use an app, Anki, A-N-K-I.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.480]   But I know for a lot of people,
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.600]   it has a very simple interface, which works for me.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.200]   But there's other apps that have a bit more like,
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.440]   you know, notification sounds and a prettier interface
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.960]   that may be a bit more manageable for people.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.360]   So there's there's a bunch of apps that you can use.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.960]   Which one you use isn't really as important as the fact
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.040]   that you are deciding, how is this going to help my spoken sessions?
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.800]   So I'm not the kind of person who says you must download this app.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.360]   You must get this specific book because these are incidental.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.920]   I will just literally find whatever book.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.960]   I'll just walk into a bookshop
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.600]   wherever I happen to be and be like, I'll pick up that one.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   You know, obviously, except for my books.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.160]   Obviously, those are the books people should be buying first.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.240]   But that being said, you just buy some language course
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.040]   and make sure you're doing stuff with your teacher and your teacher
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.480]   will help you decide a bit more directionally
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.760]   what you need to put your time into.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.560]   So I do understand people always want to know what is the app?
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.840]   What is the book?
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.760]   But it's all of these will be one percent to five percent
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.800]   contributing to your success compared to are you finding a human being
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.600]   and speaking with them regularly?
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.160]   So my my focus is way more in that direction.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.800]   And in terms of what you're doing in the long term,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.120]   you can't speak your way to fluency.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.280]   You're not going to speak every day and then eventually end up a fluency.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.440]   I have a bit more of a dynamic learning approach at the beginning.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.120]   It's all about speaking. That's priority.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.800]   I just need to have these lessons and get over my lack of confidence
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.960]   in using the little language that I have.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.080]   But with time, I when I have the basic ability to communicate,
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.720]   then I find some of the more traditional learning resources are great.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.040]   And I will go through a language learning course book and do its exercises.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.960]   I don't recommend that to people at the beginning,
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.680]   but in the later intermediate stages,
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.480]   that's when you need to start polishing up your skills.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.120]   And that's when it becomes a little bit more important in this triage system.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.440]   You know, you no longer have gunshot wounds.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.160]   So maybe the runny nose of getting the genders right in the language
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.760]   is a little bit more important now because you've solved all the other big problems.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.560]   So I start to focus on grammar.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:28.200]   I will study grammar like I'm not a fan of grammar in the beginning stages.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.520]   I think it is not.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.440]   It is one of the worst uses of your time to be studying grammar
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.360]   when you've just started to learn the language.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.680]   But at the intermediate stage, that's when it is actually a bigger priority,
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.560]   because that's that is literally your biggest problem.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.520]   You're already communicating in the language, but your grammar is lacking.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.320]   So that's what you try to fix.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.760]   So it's a very dynamic approach that you see.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.240]   What is my biggest problem right now?
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.440]   And you try to solve that problem progressively with time.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.800]   But for people just starting off, your biggest problem
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.880]   is you can't say anything in the language and you don't know
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.360]   what they're saying back to you.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.240]   So this is more a case of just pushing through the practice stage
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.040]   of giving yourself face time with a human being in whatever way that may be.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:21.600]   And how important is for languages that don't use the kind of Latin alphabet?
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.400]   How important is reading and writing?
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.120]   Reading and writing is something I also tend to put later
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.440]   in the intermediate, regardless, even even for Latin based languages
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.080]   like Spanish or French, I wouldn't really pick up a book
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.200]   and try to read it until I'm at the intermediate stages,
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.840]   because it's just too much work.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.760]   Like I literally with Spanish when I first started, one of my failed
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.320]   experiments was I picked up El Señor de los Anillos, Lord of the Rings.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.160]   And I thought, if I read this, I'll be fluent by the end of it.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.560]   And it took me weeks to get to page two because I was literally
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.640]   looking up every single word.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.200]   So that was really not a good use of my time.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.800]   Whereas when I've reached the intermediate stage,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.640]   then it becomes more manageable.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.080]   Then I'm only looking up every like 15th or 30th word
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.480]   so I can actually read significantly more and it becomes more pleasurable.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.840]   So personally, I leave reading till later.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.720]   I wouldn't necessarily say this is something I would prescribe to everybody
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.200]   because I've interviewed a lot of other language learners.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.240]   It's people will see a lot of episodes on my podcast
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.680]   where I talk to a lot of very interesting people.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.280]   And like I can think of a bunch of them.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.480]   There's Steve Kaufman, who runs the website link.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.880]   There's Professor Krashen, who's very famous for talking about
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.200]   comprehensible input, which is a philosophy in language learning
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.080]   where you try to get exposure to something that is within your language level.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.720]   And that leans a lot more towards reading.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.080]   And people would actually read from the beginning.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.920]   So that may work more appropriately for a lot of people.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.680]   But what I found is it tends to work a little bit more for maybe
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.960]   either older generations or people who are really not
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.360]   as passionate to speak the language.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.280]   And that's fine.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.240]   They have a lot of goals in the language.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.480]   But walking up to people and using it with them
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.920]   ultimately is maybe not their biggest priority.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.440]   In my case, I'm a traveler. I'm a nomad.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.320]   So speaking the language is by far the biggest priority.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.800]   I need to make friends.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   I need to interact with people in complicated situations.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.480]   So speaking is my priority.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.560]   Once I've done that, then I come back to reading and writing.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.720]   And that's regardless of whatever script it uses.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.640]   But in terms of how they're different, I don't really change
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.280]   how I learn a language when it's European versus when it's something
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.680]   like an Asian language.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.040]   I mean, maybe with something like Chinese that has
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.000]   as a character based writing system.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.840]   In that case, I would absolutely learn all my vocabulary
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   through pinyin, which is the Romanized version of Chinese characters.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.400]   So people would say, well, Chinese is one of the hardest languages in the world.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.680]   Actually, Mandarin is not that hard.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.080]   Grammatically, it's very straightforward.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.880]   And the way the words are formed is very logical.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.440]   So I really don't think Mandarin is that bad of a language.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.160]   But of course, Chinese characters are a huge barrier
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.920]   that you have to work through.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.400]   So I just decide, let's take this in two stages.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.840]   Like a native Chinese person would have done.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.200]   Chinese children learn how to speak first,
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.240]   and then they learn how to read and write.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.800]   So that's what I was going to do.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.320]   I learned how to speak Mandarin, and I would remember my vocabulary
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.840]   through pinyin, which is using our letters from the Latin alphabet
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.000]   to remember how to say the words.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.280]   And then with time, I added Chinese characters so I could begin to read
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.680]   when that was in my triage system of a bigger priority.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.040]   So that's the case with that.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.440]   But then for a language like Korean that I'm currently doing,
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.040]   it's writing system is actually very logical.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.320]   You can learn it in a weekend if you put like some intensive time into it.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.280]   It's very straightforward.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.800]   So a lot of languages that have a phonetic system like Cyrillic
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:28.000]   for Russian or for Arabic or Greek, or in the case I'm doing now, Korean.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.280]   You can still incorporate learning the the writing system
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   because that's going to help you a lot with vocabulary.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.400]   You really want to be learning your vocabulary through its writing system
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:45.120]   when it's phonetic and people get intimidated because they like
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.800]   when I saw Korean before learning it, I was like, wow, all these circles and lines.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.400]   This must be it must take years to master.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.720]   It is so easy.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.960]   I cannot overstate how easy the Korean writing system is
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.880]   to to be able to pick up.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.800]   It's extremely logical.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.920]   And it's something I did in a weekend.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.360]   So you would be surprised for a lot of languages.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.440]   It looks intimidating because all these squiggles and lines
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.560]   you've never seen before, but it's just the it's like anything.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.800]   You put a little bit of time in and it becomes manageable.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.880]   Are there some languages that, you know, do do skew on the harder
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.240]   or English or sorry, on the harder or or easier side to learn?
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.640]   So I definitely I've talked about this quite a lot.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:37.360]   There's a podcast I've done with Paul Jorgensen, and he's a big YouTuber,
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.680]   millions of subscribers from the Lang Focus.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.960]   And in that we talked about how to make difficult languages easy.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.280]   People can find that in my podcast, talked about it.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.720]   Very fascinating when you dive in that one particular topic.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.200]   But what I say in general, whenever I'm thinking about this
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.400]   is I like to get people in a different mindset.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.120]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.520]   When I was in Spain learning Spanish, I met a Spaniard
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.040]   who was learning both Japanese and French.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.280]   And I said to him, well, obviously, French is going to be a lot easier
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.160]   for you, isn't it?
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.880]   Because it's in the same language family.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.520]   And he said, absolutely not.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.560]   Japanese is so much easier.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.400]   And I didn't get it.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.680]   I was like, how? It's so different.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.960]   And he said, because I'm forced to learn French in school,
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.640]   whereas I really want to go to Japan, I like anime.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.440]   I think Japanese girls are cute.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.600]   I've always dreamed of living in the country.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.560]   And that completely transformed his experience.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.800]   And it made Japanese easier.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.640]   And I think when people come from this more academic way
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.960]   of looking at a language, they think of how am I going to decide
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.120]   which language is harder?
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.720]   Well, I'm going to put one language on one side,
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.000]   not a language on another side and compare them side by side.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   And if I see more common words like between English and French,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.400]   that makes it easier.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.000]   And if I see complicated grammar like Japanese
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.400]   having a different word order in the sentence, that makes it hard.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.080]   And that, for me, is such an inhuman way
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.880]   of deciding which languages are harder and easy.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.160]   And it is easy to scale it.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.080]   Like you can say, regardless of the person, this language is harder than that.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.200]   But realistically, each person has their own situation
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.800]   when it comes to learning a language.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.440]   They have their own passions.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.400]   They have their own motivations.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.440]   And when I think of all the languages I've learned
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:34.280]   and I compare my experiences, I would say something like Chinese
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.640]   was actually easier for me than Spanish.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.880]   And people always think that doesn't make any sense
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.200]   because Spanish is much closer to English and and all these other reasons.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.760]   You know, but ultimately, I had a bad language
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.240]   learning approach with Spanish for a long time.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.640]   It took me a very long time to get to fluency with Spanish
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.080]   to even get to a conversational level.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.120]   And I kept kicking myself.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.720]   I kept telling myself, your Spanish is miserable.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.440]   People are laughing at you.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.480]   Who would want to speak Spanish with you?
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:10.720]   And all of these reasons are why it took me so long to learn Spanish.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.280]   Whereas with Mandarin, at that stage, I had a good language learning approach.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.800]   I had a good attitude.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.600]   I embraced making mistakes.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.520]   So after three months, I reached a pretty good conversational stage.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.720]   And people can see YouTube videos of me where I'm interviewing people
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.480]   in Mandarin three months after I've started to learn the language.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.320]   I could not do that with Spanish.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.160]   Now, this does not mean I'm going to say universally.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.600]   Therefore, Mandarin is easier than Spanish.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.840]   Obviously not.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.320]   It is the context of I was a more confident person.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.560]   I had a lot better motivation with Spanish.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.600]   I didn't have great motivation at the start.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.400]   I didn't really know why did I want to learn Spanish?
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   So I was putting the effort in a very inconsistent way.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.640]   Whereas Mandarin, I knew I want to travel China.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.040]   I want to take a train 2000 kilometers deep into the country.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.280]   I want to make a video of me getting a kung fu lesson
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.120]   in a village with a kung fu master.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.560]   All these dreams that I managed to make come true.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.400]   I had these in mind, and that made Mandarin easier.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:24.320]   So when I when I talk to people and I see they've decided
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.080]   they want to learn a particular language and it has real,
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.240]   genuine significance in their life, like their family background is there
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.640]   or they have a love interest in the country.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.960]   They want to move in with or whatever it may be.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.000]   That is their passion.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.800]   And that is going to make that language
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   significantly more approachable because they have huge motivation to learn it.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:52.160]   So the fact that other languages are easier or harder is insignificant
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.920]   because they aren't going to be easier if you don't care about them.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.160]   So whatever language is the most important in your life,
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.120]   that is the easiest language, because that's the one
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.280]   you're going to be able to get momentum to learn.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.720]   I love that.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.960]   I know a lot of the podcasts we talk about travel.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.560]   I know a lot of our listeners love to travel.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.280]   And so one of the times people are often most excited to learn a language
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.800]   is that, you know, maybe they planned a trip or they have this,
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.520]   like you said, in China, a vision for a trip they want to take.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.320]   Not everyone who is planning a trip to a foreign country
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.360]   necessarily feels like they they need to become fluent.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:34.760]   Is there a stop along the way where you can have enough
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.120]   kind of skills in a language to have a different experience traveling
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.280]   and unlock, you know, really interesting things
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:47.040]   that you can get to a lot quicker and any advice for someone in that situation?
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.800]   Well, when it comes to language levels, there is a lot of specificity with this,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.280]   and this is something I take into account with my targets.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.840]   So I always work off the European Common Framework,
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:02.800]   which has a very specific way of categorizing language levels.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.200]   It splits it into A, B and C.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.280]   And within each one, it further sub splits it into one and two.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:13.400]   So A is beginner, B is intermediate, C is advanced.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.800]   One is lower, two is upper.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.600]   So A2 means you're an advanced beginner
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.800]   and C1 means you're a lower level mastery speaker of the language.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.600]   So this scale of six different levels is where I pin everything.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.760]   So for me, fluency begins at the B2 level.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.520]   This is upper intermediate.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.080]   So what that means is you can talk about most things
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.120]   you would talk about in casual social situations.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.640]   But because you're not at the C levels, you don't have a mastery level.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.760]   So in my case, I studied engineering.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.880]   So the languages I have a C level at, I could work as an engineer
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.160]   in those language and languages, and I could have a philosophical
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.240]   conversation with you about very deep subjects.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.520]   But for the most part, most conversations I'm going to have
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.160]   are the high level B2 social conversations.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.200]   So that's what I'm aiming for.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.720]   And it's important on the scale to remove perfectionism
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   because even the C2 is still not perfect.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.000]   It means that you can work functionally through the language
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.240]   the same way you would in your mother tongue.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:26.360]   Now, on the same scale, I think that at the A2 level, upper beginner,
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.200]   this is where you can function very confidently as
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.680]   an independent tourist in the language.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.160]   So you can ask for directions.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.800]   You can get the gist of their reply.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.600]   You can deal with problems like you have an injury
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   and you can get yourself to the hospital.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.360]   All of these very basic functional things you can do with confidence,
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.280]   even though you can't necessarily have full on conversations.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.160]   And I think that is fine for somebody who's going to the country briefly.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.720]   And this is something you could genuinely get to in a lot shorter
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.720]   of a time than people realize the very steep curve at the beginning.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.360]   But you can make a lot of progress very quickly.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.720]   What tends to happen is we reach the intermediate plateau.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.160]   This is where things start to get really rough,
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:19.600]   where you're putting as much effort in, but you get stuck at the middle level.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.760]   And this will happen to everybody.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.480]   And that's OK as long as you can push through to very beginning stages.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.400]   That B1, I feel, is something that is definitely achievable
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.280]   in the matter of a certain amount of months for people.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.840]   Regardless of your background, if you're able to put the time in,
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:41.600]   a B1 level means you can have a lot of conversations with people.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.640]   As long as they're a little patient with you.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:48.120]   So it's not does not count as fluency, but it counts as conversational.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:52.200]   And for me, this is where I love to be in my travels
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   because I can start to make friends in the language.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.560]   I can really hang out with people.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.800]   If you're single, you can go on dates with with with people.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.560]   You can do a lot with that B1 level.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.960]   So this, for me, is a minimum to feel like I'm truly experiencing
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.680]   the culture in a lot, a lot more of a direct way.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.840]   Anything less than that is more a case of how confident a tourist
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.720]   you are going to be, which in itself can be a wonderful thing.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.760]   You can have a lot of great experiences, but ultimately you are going to be doing
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.600]   most of your things in English if you're only at an A2 level,
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.400]   which means your your interactions, your friends and so on.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.840]   Whereas so it depends on your style of travel.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.320]   My style of travel, obviously, is I avoid English.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.440]   I want to make only local friends.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.760]   So I have to get at least a B1 level.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.280]   And that's where, you know, when you said at the beginning,
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:51.360]   Benny speaks 12 languages that that number 12 comes from B1 and up.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.560]   So I only I only I personally only say I speak a language
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.680]   if I can have conversations in the language,
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.400]   not if I would function as a tourist.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.960]   So I actually have another dozen languages that I could function
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.040]   as a tourist quite confidently.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.400]   But the thing is, that's not as impressive as it sounds,
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.320]   because you could do that a lot quicker than people realize.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.080]   You can be a very confident tourist.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.480]   You can have a bunch of phrases ready to go in a very, very short time span.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.800]   So you can be a confident tourist way faster than you imagine,
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.280]   especially if you're having consistent conversations ahead of time.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.920]   I did for a while travel to the country and think I'm going to get off the plane
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.160]   and immediately start speaking the language or start learning the language.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.160]   And that was an interesting period in my life.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.560]   But nowadays I try to learn the language ahead of time
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.080]   so I don't leave it for when I'm in the country.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.360]   I don't think especially for people who can only travel to a country
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:52.480]   for a very limited amount of time, I don't want to be in language
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.200]   learning mode if I'm only only going to be in a country for a month or two.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.440]   I want to really get to know the place.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.480]   So that's why I do my work ahead of time.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.640]   And then I can explore and make friends once I get to the country.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.920]   They said people can learn it way faster than they'd imagine.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.320]   Could you put any kind of rough, rough window on that?
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.040]   If someone's got a trip planned to Japan in a month,
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.080]   do you think they could pick up enough to get to the not not the B B level,
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.360]   but in that a level, be able to have a conversation and ask some directions
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.440]   and and not just, you know, just have a few more local experiences?
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.480]   You do that in a weekend.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.960]   But people don't realize how quickly you could learn phrases.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.680]   I think a lot of us just lack the confidence.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:37.240]   And we can't picture a universe where we walk up to somebody
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.440]   and ask for directions when we've never spoken a language before.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.760]   And we imagine this is only something geniuses do.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.960]   But like, I really want people to lower the bar on what they think
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.320]   counts as speaking a language as a tourist,
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   because like it's really not that impressive.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.680]   You're you're learning a very finite number of sentences you can rattle off.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.040]   You do not need to know the intricacies of the language
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.040]   to know how every single part of that works.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.080]   And, you know, whenever I'm starting off and I want to be a tourist
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:16.360]   and language, I'll sing myself like the phrase I want to learn.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.600]   I'll sing that to myself a few times.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.280]   And that helps me remember it.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.480]   And I'll do that in like 10 minutes.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.000]   I'll learn how to say, where is the library?
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.040]   And I'll look it up online and I'll try to say it.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.800]   And that's it. It's really not that impressive.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.120]   If you're going to Japan in a month, you can learn 20 phrases this weekend.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.800]   So instead, decide how about I'm going to take this month.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:44.640]   I'm going to try and be able to maybe understand their replies to me.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.280]   I'm going to try and push myself up to see if I can get to that A2 level
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.760]   and maybe be a little bit more confident
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:58.040]   to expand on my sentences, have a little bit of maneuverability
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.720]   where I'm not just rattling off memorized phrases.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.560]   I can replace a word or two here, here or there.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.840]   So you could do that in a month.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.760]   But if you're going to Japan, you're really passionate about it.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.360]   Maybe you should decide this this next month.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   I'm going to make those sacrifices and I'm really going to try
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:19.040]   and make Japanese my priority so that when I'm in Japan,
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.960]   I'm communicating a lot more than I would otherwise.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.680]   But it sounds like to be able to ask questions and get a response,
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.040]   not necessarily be fluent at all a month, if you can really put in the time,
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.200]   is not an unreasonable goal.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:33.880]   Absolutely.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:38.040]   And like this, what I understand, this tourist level of the language
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:42.640]   than the A levels, this is way more accessible than people imagine it to be.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.600]   It's really not that impressive.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.040]   Once you put once you've done it a couple of times, you realize
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.280]   you're just learning a few phrases and just trying to commit them to memory
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.640]   and then rattling them off
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.800]   and maybe learning a couple of the words that could come up in the replies.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.120]   So it's not that complex.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.960]   The B levels do require a certain intimate understanding
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.160]   of how the language is truly piecing together its replies
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.840]   and having a broader vocabulary so you can expand on things.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.880]   But the early levels, you could do that a lot easier than you imagine.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:15.880]   Love it.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.800]   Any any final kind of tips or hacks when it comes to language learning?
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.200]   I know you've written so many language hacks books
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.280]   that people should be kind of put in their arsenal
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.160]   as they're going through this process.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:31.200]   I mean, I mentioned my biggest hack, but in general, my philosophy is
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:36.360]   I would really encourage people to make as many mistakes as possible.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:40.240]   When I'm really getting into learning a language and doing it intensively.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:45.360]   My goal is today I'm going to make 200 mistakes or more.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.000]   That's my goal.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.440]   And that gets you completely away from this academic mindset
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.080]   where every mistake brings you closer to a fail.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.120]   Every mistake is you communicating more.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.960]   And like I said earlier, you suck a little less every day.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.440]   So that's my biggest takeaway other than speak from day one.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.360]   So I would encourage people to make mistakes.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:11.640]   Embrace your inner Spanish Tarzan or whatever.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:16.240]   You imagine this caveman functionality of the language.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.200]   Try to just use that.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.720]   And that's how you move forward.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.960]   That's how you push through those A levels to eventually
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.880]   then be communicating in the language.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.400]   Embrace being a beginner. It's fine.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:31.440]   I've had such wonderful experiences in many of my languages.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:35.400]   Even in those beginner A levels, I've had interactions
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   that I remember for the rest of my life.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.960]   And that's great.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.560]   You don't have to only be fluent in the language
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.880]   to have rich experiences in it.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.280]   So once you are OK with being a beginner,
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.720]   it becomes a lot easier to have fun with it, to make progress
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.360]   and then to go beyond that.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:53.960]   Two things.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   One, I can imagine that people listening.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.160]   We've talked multiple times about all these languages you've picked up,
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.320]   and I'm sure there's people just curious.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.040]   Would you mind sharing the languages you've kind of hit that,
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.240]   you know, be an above level just so people can kind of just
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.840]   suffice their curiosity?
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.840]   So most of the Romance languages, I would have B2 and above.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.120]   So genuine fluency.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.360]   C in a lot of them.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.920]   This would be Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:29.080]   And then I have probably a B1 in Catalan as well.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.040]   Then I have German, also high level,
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.000]   and then probably a B1 again in Dutch.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.320]   And then American Sign Language.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.760]   That would be another B1.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.040]   So most of my C levels are the Romance languages.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.800]   I also have Mandarin.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.080]   I did reach a B1 level of that, so I think I'd need
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.920]   probably a couple of weeks to get back to the B1 level
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.400]   before I return to the likes of China.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.560]   Currently learning Korean, and I'd say by the time this goes live,
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.120]   I'd say pretty decently confident that it's B1 too.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.200]   And then I've dabbled in a bunch of others
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.840]   that I would not put on that scale.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.560]   But yeah, so that's that's it in a nutshell.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560]   I know you've traveled quite a bit.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.160]   Is there a place that someone looking for some travel inspiration
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:19.920]   can take from you?
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.880]   Maybe a favorite city or country or town that isn't the obvious place
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.320]   that's on everyone's list that you want to share and maybe why it's special.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.840]   In a lot of countries, I'm a big fan of the second city.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.080]   So rather than the capital city,
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.080]   I think the second city, like as a general rule,
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.160]   it's going to be more affordable.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.360]   You're going to have less less foreigners.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.920]   So more of a chance to meet local people
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.320]   who maybe aren't overwhelmed with how many foreigners there are.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.720]   So like right now in Korea, I'm talking to you from Busan,
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.120]   which is the second city, and I can list a lot of advantages
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.840]   over going to Seoul because of how more of an authentic experience
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.000]   I'm having, but still having the comforts of being in a city.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.960]   Obviously, you're going to be even more authentic if you go to a village
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.160]   somewhere, but the city life I happen to enjoy.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.080]   So the second city in a lot of countries.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.080]   I'm a huge fan of basing myself there for a certain period of time
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.560]   to to get to know the culture in a different way.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.960]   And generally, I tend to be one of the few foreigners
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:29.400]   who is in that city to be able to have a bit more of an authentic experience.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:33.800]   I love that just a general rule of thumb is second city. Great.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.200]   If you have any final parting wisdom for anyone, please share it.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.480]   Otherwise, let people know where they can find everything you're working on.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.400]   Yeah. So since you're in podcast mode right now,
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.000]   if you do a search for language hacking, that's my podcast.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.240]   I've interviewed a lot of very interesting people with the full scale
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.240]   of people who are just starting out and having their initial success.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.080]   The people who are professional linguists in the field
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.200]   and have been doing this for decades.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.480]   I run my own coaching program
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.120]   where I help people to learn a language in three months
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.320]   to get to a conversational stage.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.240]   So people will find that on my website.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.200]   Of course, I'm on all the social medias.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.800]   I actually, as part of my way to practice languages,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.920]   I make a new social media account in each of the languages.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.160]   So even threads that as we're recording this now, it's only existed for a week.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.080]   I have 14 threads accounts just so I can follow in my target languages.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.640]   I have 14 TikTok accounts, 14 Instagram accounts.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.400]   And I use all of these to maybe post
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.400]   vertical videos to practice the language and, of course, follow people.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:51.520]   And that's my main one is Irish polyglot on most of the channels.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.400]   People can find me there and get some more inspiration.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.200]   Yeah, I mean, that just made me think of one last thing before we go.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.600]   Is is that a tactic?
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.120]   Maybe following accounts in other countries on social media?
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.320]   It never occurred to me as a potential way to practice or learn a language.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.520]   Well, a tactic that's a bit broader than that is think,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.080]   what do you tend to do with your time and how can you do that in your target language?
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.200]   So if you're the kind of person who winds your day down with Netflix,
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.800]   maybe within Netflix, create a new sub account because, you know,
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.360]   you can have multiple sub accounts on the same main login
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.480]   and make that just your target language.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.040]   So you're only watching stuff in the language
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.240]   and the algorithm will recommend that to you.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.080]   I personally happen to watch a lot of TikTok videos.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.360]   That's how I wind down as I swipe up, up, up, up, watch TikTok.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.920]   So rather than do that in English, which is not really that good of a use of my time,
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.440]   I created new accounts and I trained the algorithm
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.560]   to only show me content in those languages.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.080]   I only followed people who made content in those languages.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.560]   So when I switched to it, I'm in that language mode.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.000]   I'm using my computer.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.960]   So I made sure that I could switch the language on my computer on my phone.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.920]   I very quickly changed the interface on my phone.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.800]   So it's more of a broader thing of thinking, how are you living your life?
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.120]   What are the things you're doing?
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.760]   And can you change any of those things to be in your target language?
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.440]   You like playing video games?
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.640]   Change the language that they're giving you the orders
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.800]   to shoot that guy to be in your target language.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:26.440]   And there's a lot of ways you can have this sense of virtual immersion
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.360]   without even having to to leave your home country,
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.840]   that you can exist in the language you like working out.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   Look for I work out these days to Korean workout music.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.240]   And that's like the same kind of bump,
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.960]   thump, thump music, but they're singing in Korean.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.080]   So everything you do, try to do it in your target language.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.920]   And in my case, I use social media a lot.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.800]   So I may as well use social media in my target language.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.200]   I love that tip.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.440]   This has been fantastic.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.000]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.280]   I am I'm excited to to pick up a new language.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.640]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.760]   And I hope to hear from all of you.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.760]   And best of luck on all of your own language journeys.
