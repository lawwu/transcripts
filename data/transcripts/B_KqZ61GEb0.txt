[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   All right, part two of the show, we're gonna do some questions about living a deeper life.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.160]   We haven't had a call yet, so we'll start with a call.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.440]   We'll kick things off with a call from Michael.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.760]   All right, here we go.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.480]   Hey, Cal and Jessie.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.920]   First off, thanks for all that you guys do.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.560]   Big fan of your work.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.360]   I recently quit my job as a product manager in tech to find more meaning in my work and
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.360]   really just become self-employed.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.600]   I have a few main areas that I want to grow in and would like to know how you suggest
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.540]   balancing efforts on a macro and micro scale.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.920]   Just for context, the three areas are, first off, my main project is a website for runners,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.920]   training plans and such.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520]   I have one business partner and we plan to launch it soon.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.360]   I've been working on that for about a year.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.320]   Secondly, I'm taking a course to build out a skill set as a UI designer.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.840]   I want to do UI design for my own projects and perhaps freelance someday.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.440]   And then thirdly, I just want to create more online blogging videos, using social to connect
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.800]   with others and really just make useful content around my interests.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.720]   Speaking of my interests, I'm just a super curious person, have a lot of hobbies as it
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.440]   is, so guitar, action sports, music making, photo video, and all of these interests pull
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.160]   for my time and attention as well.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.080]   I have tried to do day theming and use systematic time blocking really to attack all of these
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.720]   different areas and interests, but it just felt too rigid and formulaic to me.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   So yeah, my key question is how do you suggest I focus on a macro and micro scale to have
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.120]   progress in these multiple areas, which all feel important to me?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.000]   Thanks guys.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.880]   Well, the issue is if you're trying to make progress on all of those things at the same
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.080]   time, you will make meaningful progress on almost none of them.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.420]   This is a principle that's on my mind because I write about this actually in the slow productivity
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.840]   book we were talking about before in my chapter on doing fewer things and not to give away
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.360]   too much, but I have a whole chapter section in that chapter about this reality that the
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   function that mediates the relationship between effort and reward, we often incorrectly think
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.280]   about that as a linear function, no matter what we spend our time on.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.440]   So you sort of spend 10 hours working on things, you get 10 hours worth of reward, but that's
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.320]   not actually how it works.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.480]   It tends to be more nonlinear.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.040]   So if you spend a lot of time on one thing, the reward you begin to get for that time
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.320]   takes off and gets bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.640]   So you kind of have these moments, these discontinuities where the reward you get after you've really
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.320]   focused on something for a while really jumps up.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.440]   That reward curve really jumps up.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.400]   So the reality of this is it is not the same to take a set pool of hours and split it among
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.820]   multiple things or put all that time on the one thing.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.520]   You do not end up with the same reward in the end.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.680]   If this function was simply linear, then spending one hour on 10 separate projects would give
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.080]   you the same reward as 10 hours on one project.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.160]   You might as well do the 10 separate projects because it's interesting, it keeps your options
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.840]   open, etc.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920]   But if it's not linear, which is what I argue is true, then putting 10 hours on one project
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.280]   could give you a massive reward.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.520]   We're putting one hour in each project might not get you much at all.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.000]   All right, so that's kind of technical here, but it all leads to I think the obvious conclusion,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.920]   which is you need to do less.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.680]   Now that's scary because you're thinking, well, these things are important to me.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.160]   There's different aspects of my life.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.320]   There's different options I want to pursue.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.120]   I can't just stop everything.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.600]   So I'm going to give you a two-step process here.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.080]   One, I do think you need to simplify, especially in that world of hobbies, etc.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.240]   This is what you're going for in your professional life.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.480]   And maybe outside of your professional life, you cut this down to two things, maybe three.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.720]   Next, you want to have one point of major focus that is getting most of your time and
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.840]   everything else you want to baseline.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.800]   Baseline means you have some sort of maintenance ritual or habit.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.740]   So it's not forgotten, but it's not getting much of your time.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.480]   And most of your time is on one thing.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.720]   So like professionally, maybe most of that time is going into the new website, though
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.040]   I might recommend that sounds like this UX, you need a job, right?
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   You quit your job.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.680]   So if UX is going to be your career, that might be the thing you're really putting your
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   time into.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.800]   And you're just baselining the website.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.160]   Let's put that on hold for now or just make very small progress.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.920]   I'm going all in on the UX design.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.360]   Choose one thing I go all in on.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.040]   You might again with your hobbies have something similar.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   You have a background fitness routines, you stay in shape for various action sports you're
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.000]   interested in, but you're not doing any training for those sports.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   And all of your hobby time is going into guitar.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.400]   So like you baseline almost everything, and a very small number of things you put time
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.680]   into because again, you put enough time into something, that's when you get these discontinuity,
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.120]   these discontinuity, these big jumps in the rewards you get.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.400]   And then once you focus on something for a while, and have had a big jump in reward,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.040]   then you can turn your attention to something else and do something similar for the next
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.480]   six months, next year, the next two years, whatever it takes.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.120]   So you have to you have to simplify.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.680]   And then even once you simplify, only one or two things should be getting any sort of
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.080]   serious attention at a time, that in the end is going to unlock way more reward than trying
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.280]   to keep switching back and forth really quickly.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.960]   So that's what I recommend.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.760]   What I'm saying here is pretty similar to my deep life buckets, Keystone habit type
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   advice.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.800]   We'll get to that in a second, that sort of more, I would say more philosophical thinking,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.480]   which covers not just work, but your whole life.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.280]   We'll get into that more in a future question.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   But it is similar.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   And that's on purpose, because I think this idea of baselining what's important, but putting
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.440]   huge energy into a small number of things at a time, that's the right formula.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.160]   [MUSIC]
