[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720]   - Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.480]   with longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.360]   Today's question comes from an anonymous man.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.100]   Pastor John, I heard the episode
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.680]   about caring for aging parents.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.040]   That was episode 1078,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.240]   and we published that back on August 9th of this year.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.400]   It's titled Retirement Homes and Caring for Aging Parents.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.860]   Back to the question.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.360]   In that episode, you got me thinking about my job.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.800]   I work in a nursing home and see our elders
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.880]   in a way many of us fear becoming.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.640]   Could you speak to the dignity of people in nursing homes
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.480]   with diseases such as dementia?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.780]   This seems to me to be perhaps even more foundational
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.640]   under the answers about caring for aging parents.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.080]   Would you say that's right?
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.920]   - Right, that's absolutely right.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.440]   The God-given dignity of every human being
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.100]   is created in God's image and destined for final
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.180]   accountability before the living God,
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.180]   unlike all the other creatures,
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.580]   that dignity is foundational to our thinking
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.580]   about how families or caregivers care for aging parents
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.420]   or for that matter, for any person
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.060]   whose mental capacities are diminished for whatever reason.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.220]   So let me just share a few foundational
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.740]   and application thoughts about the dignity
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.940]   of those with diminished powers
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.340]   of thought and self-awareness.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.260]   First, we can hardly be reminded too often
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.260]   or too deeply of the staggering truth of Genesis 1:27.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.160]   So God created man in his own image.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.860]   In the image of God, he created him.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.180]   Male and female, he created them.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.420]   And then you add the additional truth
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.340]   that even after the fall into sin,
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.340]   this great reality of image bearing is still true
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.340]   about all of the people that we deal with
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.220]   and should affect our behavior.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.900]   James 3:9, "With the tongue, we bless our Lord and Father,
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.620]   "and with it, we curse people."
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.540]   Who are made in the likeness of God.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.220]   So you can see how James thinks that that fact
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.980]   should alter the way we use our tongues
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.260]   and talk about people.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.860]   Every human being, everywhere in the world,
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.460]   of every race, every ethnicity, class,
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.580]   male and female, rich and poor, sick and well,
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.740]   is utterly distinct from all the other kinds
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.380]   of creatures on earth.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.380]   So that 1 Peter 2:17 says, "Amazingly, honor all,"
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.340]   meaning honor all human beings.
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.340]   And the honor clearly does not flow from moral worthiness.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.460]   They're not, a lot of them are wicked, like Nero.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.600]   And it goes on to say, "Honor the emperor."
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.900]   They're wicked.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.280]   And so the honor is not flowing
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.240]   from their unique moral condition,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.940]   but from their unique standing in the image of God,
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.100]   different from all other creatures.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.220]   And that applies to an 80 pound arthritic,
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.940]   diapered, drooling, glaze-eyed human being
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.980]   that we love lying in bed, praying for death
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.180]   in the nursery home or in the jungle hut.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.260]   Now, a second observation needs to be remembered,
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.260]   namely that in God's way of dealing with the world,
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.780]   he has elevated weakness
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.980]   to a place of extraordinary importance.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.620]   The weakness of God is stronger than the power of man,
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.500]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians,
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.500]   meaning when Christ died in weakness and dishonor,
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.740]   he accomplished the greatest thing in the world.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.700]   And then Paul refers to his own weakness
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.660]   in 2 Corinthians 12 as the best pathway
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.340]   for honoring the all-sufficiency of Christ in his life.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.540]   And then he brings this weakness
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.780]   into connection with the dying process
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.600]   and relates it to the resurrection
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.660]   in 1 Corinthians 15, 43 like this.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.900]   The human body is sown in dishonor.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.540]   It is raised in glory.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.160]   It is sown in weakness.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.860]   It is raised in power.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.460]   In other words, Paul is telling us
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.460]   that the weak, inglorious, demented shadow
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   of a once strong Christian person in front of us
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.460]   is on the brink of glory and power.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.900]   You need to go to nursing homes and think that way.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.140]   These people are on the brink of glory and power.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.620]   We must keep this continuity in mind
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.620]   between diminished powers of human being here
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.780]   and the spectacular powers they will have
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.260]   in the resurrection.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.380]   If we lose, this is so important,
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.980]   if we lose a sense of that continuity,
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.980]   we will assume that we are becoming less human
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.540]   rather than being on the brink
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.300]   of being gloriously superhuman.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.860]   And if the question is raised,
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.860]   because I did mention the word Christian,
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.780]   if the question is raised,
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.580]   what about the unbeliever in the nursing home?
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.700]   The answer is we never give up.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.700]   We never give up praying that they too might participate
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.400]   in that glorious destiny.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.820]   This is what they could be.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.100]   We're not God.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.980]   We do not determine anyone's destiny.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.260]   We treat people, we speak to people on earth
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.100]   in the prayer, in the witness,
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.940]   in the hope of redemption and glory.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.060]   Which leads to one more thing maybe,
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.420]   namely the mystery of personhood
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.340]   in the presence of dementia.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.380]   Science cannot answer the question
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.660]   that relates to the soul
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.780]   that God himself created in connection to the body.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.660]   The relationship is profound beyond all human comprehension.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.660]   No one, no one knows the precise connection
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.620]   between the demented mind and the real soul,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.140]   the real human person within.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.740]   My grandfather, just before he died,
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.720]   was curled up like a fetus in a diaper,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   looking like a corpse, uncommunicative for weeks,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.980]   slow, belabored breathing.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.340]   But when my father bent over his head
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.060]   and prayed almost at the top of his voice and finished,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.260]   my grandfather, almost with his whole body,
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.260]   gave a deep, guttural, unmistakable, "Amen."
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.800]   That was the last we heard of him.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.220]   We hadn't heard anything for weeks.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.220]   I will never, I will never assume
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.300]   that any human being that is still breathing
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.300]   cannot in some way be reached at his innermost being.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.020]   I don't know, I just won't assume it.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.780]   And the last thing I would say
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.340]   is that the encroachment of dementia
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.280]   in the lives of those we love is a gift to us,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.160]   testing our love as never before.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.400]   One of the manifestations of dementia
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.120]   is that every moment is real to the failing person,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.600]   but the connection of the moments is lost.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.180]   So as I was driving my father in his last days
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.840]   to his brother's funeral, whom he loved dearly,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.280]   he asked me every two minutes in that 20-minute drive,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.580]   he asked me every two minutes where we were going.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.280]   In every single one of those questions,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.840]   he really wanted to know.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.000]   He was really there.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.920]   He was really curious in that moment
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.120]   about where we were going.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.720]   And the real test, the real question for me was,
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   would I patiently, graciously, as if for the first time,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.600]   on the 10th time, answer him with grace and interest,
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.400]   engaging the person who was there in that moment?
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   Such challenges of love are no accident.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.520]   They're no accident.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.160]   God didn't bring that into my life for nothing.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   That was a painful gift to me and a test,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.240]   and we all will have them.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.040]   So let us be full of grace as we give ourselves
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.360]   to care for those who have become too weak,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.480]   physically or mentally, to care for themselves.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   God's priorities for efficiency in this world are not ours.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.040]   - Moving.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.840]   Thank you for this God-centered vision
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.200]   over such a challenging end of life issue.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.160]   And thank you, as always, for taking us
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.000]   into some of your own personal experiences as well,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.080]   Pastor John, I really appreciate your self-disclosure
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   in these things.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.160]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.320]   a part of your day and your commute.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.440]   Three times a week we publish,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.400]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.200]   and search our past episodes and find episode 1078
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   in our archive at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.340]   Well, entertainment is intended to be entertaining,
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.660]   of course, that's what it means to be entertaining,
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.380]   and we can love it too much.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.380]   So how do we know if we love time with God
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.780]   more than we love our entertainment,
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.540]   or whether we love our entertainment
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.660]   more than we love time with God?
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.860]   It's a very relevant, sobering, and important question
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.180]   on the docket for Monday.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.660]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.100]   and we'll see you on the other side of the weekend.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.260]   (upbeat music)
