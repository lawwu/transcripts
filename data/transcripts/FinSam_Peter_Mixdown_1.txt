[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.880]   the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.180]   And in this episode, I have a special guest with me,
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.020]   Peter Atwater, author of "The Confidence Map."
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.000]   Say hello Peter and welcome.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.520]   - Hi Sam, glad to be here.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.520]   - So you are a adjunct professor
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.240]   at the College of William & Mary, my alma mater.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.680]   So I've got to start by asking you,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.960]   how's that experience going and how did you find that job?
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.080]   - So it's interesting 'cause I'm an alum.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.280]   I'm also the parent of William & Mary's alums.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.580]   My wife is an alum.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.960]   And so this has been sort of a round trip
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.560]   to go back into the department that I graduated from
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.840]   and actually working with colleagues
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.440]   that taught me at one point, which is a wild thought.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.920]   But no, I started teaching a class
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.320]   at the University of Delaware
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.800]   and got talking to some of my former colleagues
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.440]   at William & Mary and they said,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.360]   "Why don't you come teach that here?"
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.080]   And so that's how this all started.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.480]   - Is it that easy to say, "I'm an alum.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.440]   "I have something to teach, please hire me."
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.680]   How does that work?
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.120]   - So I think they were looking for somebody
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.720]   in the department who had applied experience.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.360]   A lot of economics tends to be theory.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.720]   And my interest more broadly is,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.320]   how does what we teach theoretically get applied
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.960]   in real terms in the markets?
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680]   So, because I think that often there's a disconnect
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.240]   between the behavior we would anticipate in concept
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.640]   and what happens in practice.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.480]   - Right, right.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.360]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.800]   So behavior finance,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.040]   are you in the finance department or economics department?
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.320]   - Economics department.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.160]   - Okay, yes.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.240]   I was an economics major as well.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.620]   Those were good times.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.560]   How old are your children now?
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.880]   - In their 20s.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.720]   - Okay.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.600]   And so the graduate from William & Mary,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120]   what are they up to?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.720]   - So they both work for government contractors in DC.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.600]   - Ah, okay, okay.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.440]   That's, there's a lot of money and power
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.280]   up in Northern Virginia.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520]   - There is a fascinating place.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.000]   - So congrats on your book, "The Confidence Map."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.760]   I had to read, great book.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.440]   And I'm looking to help listeners get an understanding
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.800]   of what the confidence map is.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.620]   I can describe it,
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.760]   or maybe you can talk about the X-axis,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.080]   the Y-axis and the four quadrants.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   - Sure, so the confidence map is trying to create
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.080]   a framework to visualize confidence.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.780]   Confidence tends to be something that we talk about,
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.240]   but don't really understand.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.820]   We know when we see it,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.080]   but we've not really spent much time
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720]   thinking about what it is.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.280]   And I concluded that confidence requires
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.240]   two critical feelings,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.400]   a feeling of certainty,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.200]   that we know that things are predictable
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.280]   and that we can anticipate what's ahead.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.800]   And then the other is control,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.960]   that we feel prepared and have the tools
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.880]   and resources necessary to be successful.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.560]   And so what I did was to put those as axes
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.320]   on a simple two by two box chart
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   with certainty on the X-axis and control on the other.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.000]   And the result is four environments
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.200]   where we have different mixes
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.400]   of how those two things come together.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.080]   - Right, and so for those who want to know
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.600]   what the boxes are,
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.440]   so high certainty, high control is the comfort zone,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.160]   high certainty, low control is the passenger seat,
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.800]   low certainty, low control is the stress center,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.600]   and high control, low certainty is the launch pad.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.240]   And I think most of us would like to be
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.920]   in the high certainty, high control comfort zone,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.000]   upper right-hand box,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.160]   but I'm not sure how many of us can actually get there.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.760]   And we must probably be in different boxes
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.600]   with different types of subject matters
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   and different types of activities.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.000]   - And even at different moments of our day.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.240]   I mean, I demonstrate in the book
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.000]   that a plane ride can take us all over those four boxes,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.880]   depending on if the ride is turbulent
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.800]   and you can suddenly find yourself in the stress center.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.440]   - So one of my favorite topics about personal finance
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.360]   is giving people the courage, the confidence
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.680]   to be able to do what they want,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.560]   to be able to speak their mind,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.480]   to be able to live a life more true to themselves,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.000]   not true to someone else.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.840]   And I think part of the way to get there
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.040]   is to have more money,
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.120]   because the more money you have,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.800]   the more you can tell people to screw off
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.480]   and you can just do whatever you want.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.200]   So one of my questions for you, Peter,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.000]   is given we like control and certainty,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.280]   why do you think more people don't save more money?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.440]   Why not save more money?
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.360]   Why not learn more about personal finance?
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   Why not invest more for your future?
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.440]   What's going on here?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   - So I think part of it is that
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.760]   when we don't have confidence,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.800]   we don't think as much about the future.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.600]   So the opposite of confidence is vulnerability.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.120]   And so if I'm feeling vulnerable,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.760]   I'm focused on the problem that's in hand.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.960]   And so my whole orientation
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.360]   turns from the future to the present.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.760]   And that affects all of the choices that I make.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.200]   And so I'm not gonna commit the resources
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.840]   to this abstract thing called retirement or the future,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   when in fact I have an immediate problem
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.600]   that I need to address.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.560]   And I think that's a big piece of why you don't see
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.960]   the focus on the future and retirement,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.000]   particularly today,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.600]   given where a lot of consumers' confidence is.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.680]   - And where do you think the average consumer confidence is
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.680]   in terms of their personal finances?
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.160]   - I think the further away you get
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.120]   from people in the market, the lower it is.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.800]   I'm the economist who came up with the K-shaped recovery.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   And what I've found is that
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.720]   those who are closest to the markets who've been invested
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.080]   tend to feel really good right now.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.120]   They've done extraordinarily well.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.800]   There's a lot of wealth that's been created.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.440]   But if you didn't participate,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.920]   you have feelings like you've been left behind.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.800]   And you add inflation,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.080]   particularly food and energy inflation,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.760]   and you really start to feel like you're behind.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.000]   - Right.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.680]   And when you start feeling behind,
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.360]   is it fair to say that you will take action
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   to stop feeling behind
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.840]   and to try to learn more and do more?
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.000]   What happens there?
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.760]   - So learning is really hard when we don't have confidence
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.560]   because our brain is already preoccupied
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.080]   with the problems that we're trying to solve elsewhere.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   It's much easier to think creatively and abstractly
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.360]   when you have confidence than when you don't.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.520]   And there's a lot of work that Daniel Kahneman has done
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.560]   looking at the way that the actual cognitive processing
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.400]   that we use.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   And we use up a lot of bandwidth when we feel vulnerable
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.200]   because we're trying to address other things
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.400]   that are bothering us.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.360]   - Right.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.560]   So there was a great part in your book.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.000]   It talked about, I think it was about problem solving
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.360]   or stressing or like solving one and then solving two.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.880]   And when, what were the terms again?
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.680]   - So system one and system two
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.040]   are the processing terms that psychologists use.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.880]   - Oh, right.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.200]   So I thought that was really fascinating
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.040]   because in terms of system one,
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.880]   you talked about kind of doing things almost on autopilot.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.160]   But as soon as we get into system two,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.480]   where we're trying to multiply by 17
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.360]   versus multiply by two,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.600]   then the whole cognitive process slows down.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.040]   Can you just talk about that whole system one, system two?
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.880]   - Sure.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.480]   So if I think about counting by twos,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.800]   two, four, six, eight, 10, 12,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   that's system one thinking.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.320]   It's easy, it's fast, it's impulsive.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.440]   I'm not even thinking necessarily
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.680]   when I'm rattling all those off.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.720]   And it's like driving your car
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.320]   on a straight highway on a sunny day.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.480]   Psychologists talk about that almost as in terms of fluency.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.480]   And I like that 'cause it just,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.560]   not only does it describe
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.000]   learning a second language effectively,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.840]   but just that through that, that through feeling.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.120]   And through is all about system one thinking.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.120]   - Right.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.680]   - But if I suddenly make you add by 17s,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   now you've got complexity that's hard and slow and tiring.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.520]   And it becomes really difficult
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.320]   to deal with other things
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.400]   when your brain is still struggling
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.720]   with these problems that you're trying to solve
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.080]   in the back of your mind unconsciously.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   - Right, right.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.240]   No, absolutely.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.800]   And so how does one move from system two
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.240]   to system one more efficiently?
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.080]   - So it's about regaining a sense of control
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.680]   and feelings of certainty in the process.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.120]   And often that starts with really small steps.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.360]   Doing something to demonstrate that you have that,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.760]   often it means preparing to take control
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.480]   and establishing little habits,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.240]   little routines that gets you prepared
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.920]   for that big moment where you may be changing jobs
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.120]   or you may be moving locations
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.000]   or doing something dramatic to take control.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.640]   We don't necessarily take the time to be prepared for that.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.520]   And so we fail, we get discouraged again,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.240]   and then we stop trying.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.280]   - Right, yeah.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.560]   That's one of the things we talk about on Financial Samurai
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.240]   is why give up when you can keep on going?
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.520]   Is there something about confidence and giving up
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   that's interrelated?
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   - Yeah, so when we deliberately take risk,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.120]   take control, and we don't succeed,
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.320]   we feel like we have only ourselves to blame.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.240]   And that box of low certainty, low control,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.720]   that stress center is a place
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.800]   where our stories reflect how bad we feel.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.880]   And we're mean to ourselves in that box.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.840]   In so many dimensions, we search,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.120]   am I ugly, am I stupid, am I fat?
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.760]   But we self-criticize,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.120]   and often it's a function of the fact
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   that we've failed at something
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.680]   and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.880]   And we get focused on the past
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.920]   rather than just living in the present.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.480]   - Now, is that one of the reasons why people don't try?
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.360]   Because if you don't try,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.720]   then nobody can blame you or criticize you?
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.600]   - Yeah, or often they've been led to believe
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.520]   that they don't have the ability in the first place.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.120]   A lot of folks who are in the passenger seat,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.400]   who are in a workplace environment
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.840]   where their manager may be demeaning and belittling,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.880]   or they're in a relationship
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.240]   where their partner's not encouraging,
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.280]   have been told stories that they believe
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.720]   that they couldn't successfully take a chance
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.200]   and succeed.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.280]   So they have a whole narrative
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.560]   that goes along with their low confidence.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.760]   - Yeah, that's a good point about managing,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.400]   bad managers and employees.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.280]   I think about that as a parent now
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.480]   in terms of the messages that I wanna give my children,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.840]   and maybe some listeners or parents themselves.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.720]   Is there some kind of psychological thing
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.240]   where maybe parents have their own low self-confidence
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   that gets fed onto their children?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.000]   Where do you think parents are in the confidence map?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.560]   - So parenting, yeah, I mean,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.360]   parenting moves us all over the place.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.320]   If you've taught your kids to drive,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.080]   you've been in that passenger seat.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.920]   - Nope, not yet.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.800]   - And well, it can go from being very calm
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.960]   to chaotic in a flash.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.800]   - Absolutely.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.280]   - I could speak to that from personal experience.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.280]   But one of the things as a parent,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.920]   we often try to solve a problem
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   or help our children to solve a problem
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   without also thinking about the lingering feelings
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.080]   from what have just happened.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.160]   When I talk to doctors,
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.320]   I say the difference between curing and healing a patient
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.120]   is the restoration of confidence.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.360]   And so to think about,
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.280]   and I've done this work with coaches,
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.440]   you know, when somebody is struggling
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.320]   to help them to think directly about,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.000]   you know, what are the steps that you need to take,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   have to take to regain control, to regain certainty,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.120]   and not to presume that you know,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.800]   that you as a parent understand,
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   because you may, if you impose your own experiences,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.960]   chances are you're wrong.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.320]   And that's one of the things that I've discovered is,
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.720]   we can all go through the same experience,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   but perceive that experience in very different ways.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.040]   - Yeah, parenting is super hard.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.800]   I think we're probably in the stress center a lot,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.360]   low certainty, because we don't know
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.840]   whether our parenting skills will help them,
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.720]   because it's gonna take maybe 20 years
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.040]   to figure out if they're good people.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.680]   And then control, maybe medium control.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.320]   I mean, we control what they do,
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.560]   and what they eat, and what they watch,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.400]   but after they gain a certain age, no more control.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.520]   - No, it's a process of losing control as a parent.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.240]   And hoping that, you know,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.240]   I think the self-help world has done a lot of people
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.200]   a disservice in suggesting that you have to have confidence
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.440]   to be successful.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.640]   And rather than encouraging our children to be confident,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.960]   we should be encouraging them to be resilient,
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.240]   to accept that there are going to be moments in life
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.880]   where you're naturally feel vulnerable,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.720]   where you naturally don't have control,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.120]   naturally don't feel things are certain.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.440]   And that success ultimately comes from developing the skills
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   to navigate those, to be comfortable in being uncomfortable.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.520]   - No, I absolutely agree.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.240]   Now, as a behavior economist
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.300]   who came up with the confidence map,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.280]   can you recognize people who are underconfident,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.560]   confident, or overconfident?
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.920]   What are some kind of titles that you can see?
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.760]   I mean, we're talking right now,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.640]   I don't know how you're viewing this conversation,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.800]   or you're viewing me.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.440]   What are some things that go on in your head
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.440]   when you think about confidence in other people?
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.600]   - So I look for two other behaviors
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.720]   that will naturally tie to how people feel.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.940]   One is the stories they're telling themselves and others,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.180]   because our narratives always mirror our mood.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.420]   And so your description of what you think is coming,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.640]   how you feel about the world around you,
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.880]   those stories are gonna give me insights.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.480]   And so is your behavior,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.240]   because a confident person behaves in ways
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.560]   that are distinct from somebody
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.780]   who doesn't have confidence.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.440]   We readily accept the notion of overconfidence,
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.460]   and overconfidence is seeing more certainty
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.760]   and feeling more control than are real.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.320]   We need to be as open to the idea of underconfidence
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.800]   where we perceive too much uncertainty
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.480]   and feel too powerless versus what's real.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.480]   When I think about people catastrophizing,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.360]   that's a telltale sign of somebody who's underconfident.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.100]   - Yeah, you see that all the time on the internet.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.600]   Like the world is coming to an end.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.480]   - Yeah, and we have a lot of that today.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.560]   I actually think underconfidence
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   is one of the greatest risks that we have.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.800]   That people are overestimating the troubles
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.360]   and what might be ahead,
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.080]   and that that itself becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.600]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.760]   I mean, I play a lot of tennis
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.940]   and I play competitive tennis.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.120]   And if you tell yourself you can't win,
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.520]   you're already losing.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.080]   It's really hard to win if you don't believe you can win.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.720]   What about the confident person
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.560]   who kind of shows underconfidence?
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.600]   Is there such a person where
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.120]   you know that they're pretty smart,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.840]   you know that they know their stuff,
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.160]   but they kind of give off a,
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.200]   ah, I don't really know what I'm talking about.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.360]   Is there that type of archetype?
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.680]   - Yeah, 'cause I think confidence and self-confidence
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.960]   or confidence and self-esteem
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.520]   are two very different things.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.000]   I mean, I've dealt with many successful people
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.880]   who are not self-confident.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.840]   - Oh, awesome.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.120]   - And so they wear this mask of bravado
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.940]   that is hiding the lack of self-confidence that they have.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.440]   Now, as a researcher in what I do,
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.320]   I'm not really focused on self-confidence.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.240]   To me, that's an inward assessment.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.440]   What affects our behaviors a lot more
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.040]   is our outward assessment.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   I mean, you look at COVID
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.400]   and I saw lots of people
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.520]   who were incredibly self-confident,
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   but whose confidence was really shaken by the outbreak.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.600]   - Right, and during COVID,
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.640]   that was, I guess, the stress center,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.520]   low control, low certainty,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.120]   'cause nobody had any idea what was going on.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.840]   - That's right, and we acted like it.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.240]   I mean, if you look at our decisions from March 2020,
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.120]   none of them were focused on the future.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.400]   I mean, we couldn't imagine a future.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.880]   And they were all impulsive and emotional.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.640]   And here's the irony of it, Sam,
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.920]   that the world is panicking.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.960]   And panic, as a researcher, to me,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.280]   is a wonderful leading indicator
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.120]   that a low in confidence is rapidly approaching,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.780]   that the worst is actually behind us,
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.720]   not ahead of us like we think.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.920]   And so if we, particularly from an investing perspective,
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.480]   can look at panic with some distance
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.720]   and appreciate that it's telling us
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   that people around us are losing all confidence
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.840]   and are at the risk of catastrophizing
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.800]   and becoming woefully underconfident,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.000]   then we can get prepared to go into the markets
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.800]   rather than run away from the markets with the crowd.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.520]   - No, I agree.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.000]   It's interesting right now in late 2023
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.440]   how S&P 500 seems like it's back to bull markets,
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.200]   tech stocks are on fire, a lot of confidence,
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   and yet earnings seem to be declining year over year.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.280]   There's a lag effect with the Fed funds rates
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.980]   slowing down consumption spending and business spending.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.780]   Where do you think we are now on the confidence scale?
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.040]   - So one of the things that I think is really important
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.340]   is the difference between 2023 investing
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.340]   and early 2021 investing.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.520]   If I rewind the clock two and a half years
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.160]   and I look at what investors were piling into,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.900]   it was SPANs, it was NFTs,
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:13.160]   crypto with names that I can't say on TV,
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.900]   and things that were highly abstract and futuristic
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.220]   and fantasy and untested.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.120]   And if I look at this year,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.620]   what did investors flooded into?
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.940]   The magnificent seven,
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.900]   the most proven horses in the stable.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.340]   Rather than being interested in, you know,
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.300]   that these unborn or young untested cult,
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.740]   we're investing in thoroughbreds that have,
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.820]   and that to me is a reflection of reduced confidence.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.660]   - Reduced, right.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.540]   - That we're not as confident
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   as we were two and a half years ago.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.260]   The way the indices work,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.260]   that relative decline in confidence has been masked
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.240]   because those magnificent seven dominate,
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.780]   you know, Apple and Microsoft and Google,
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.620]   they dominate the indices.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.340]   But I'm quite troubled by
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.560]   how relatively underconfident
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.900]   investors are versus two years ago.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.360]   This is a different kind of bubble.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   This is a bubble in the things that are tried and true.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.980]   - Yeah, it is interesting,
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.300]   the lack of breath in market participants,
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.820]   company participants of the S&P 500 is astounding.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.740]   - Yeah.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.940]   - Yeah, so it's gonna be interesting to see
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.300]   because they're definitely,
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.020]   if you look at the history of time,
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.460]   inverted yield curves lead to recession.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.700]   But actually speaking of which,
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.960]   so a recession, the definition of a recession
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.060]   when I was at William & Mary
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.420]   was two consecutive quarters of declining GDP growth.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.740]   That's what we had, I think,
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.980]   for fourth quarter last year and first quarter 2023.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.500]   And I think we had that again in 2022 in the beginning.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.460]   So why aren't we admitting?
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.140]   Why isn't the government saying,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.900]   we already went through a recession?
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.620]   - You know, it's funny, Sam,
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.620]   I don't pay any attention to economic data at all.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:29.120]   It tends to be a lagging indicator in the work that I do.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.180]   And I don't, to me, what matters isn't the data,
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.660]   it's our interpretation of the data.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.100]   And so I care, I pay much more attention
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.420]   to the stories that investors are telling each other,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.380]   not the actual objective figures
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.100]   'cause objective figures are not very useful.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.340]   And I use the example in the book.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.380]   I can tell you, if I tell you it's 70 degrees,
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.460]   you have to decide whether that's warm or cool to you.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.020]   And if it's warm, you're gonna wear shorts.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.620]   If it's cool, you're gonna grab a sweater.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.720]   So data by itself needs a story.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.700]   And it's those stories that actually translate
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.620]   into behavior, not the data itself.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.780]   - Okay.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.460]   I've never heard an economist not look at the data,
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.660]   pay attention to the data before.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.540]   So what are the stories that you're hearing now
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.740]   from the business leaders you talk to
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.260]   or other professors or students?
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.580]   - Sure, so the stories are that the worst of inflation,
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.760]   the worst risks of recession are behind us.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.900]   And that bothers me for two reasons,
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.540]   because to me, the best indicator of a recession
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.540]   is the fearlessness with which we take a recession seriously.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.380]   And so there seems to be a broad consensus
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.140]   that there won't be a recession,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.180]   or if it is, it's a soft landing
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.140]   where we've already concluded
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.600]   that we've successfully navigated it.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.880]   So I'm more worried about a recession today
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.540]   given how few people are.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.740]   And that's the nature of the work that I do.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.260]   I'm far less worried about a recession
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.500]   when everyone is convinced it's coming.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.220]   - Yeah, it'll be interesting.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.100]   I mean, like you said, the terms, the behavior,
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.140]   it just seems to me like we're just talking
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.340]   stories, everything is a story.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.380]   What is the definition of recession?
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.340]   Seems like it can be different for anybody
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.980]   interpreting it, and if you lose your job,
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.940]   well, that's probably a big recession.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.180]   And if you don't, you're like everything is hunky-dory.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.420]   And so one of the problems that I have
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.460]   on financialsamurai.com and the podcast
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.780]   is I'm generally a really optimistic person.
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.140]   I'm a super optimist.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.220]   I think if I sprained my ankle,
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.780]   I think, thank God I didn't break my ankle,
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.420]   and I can still record a podcast the next day.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.820]   And so what would you say to those super optimists,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.780]   to those people who probably are overconfident?
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.460]   I'm probably a little overconfident.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.020]   What should we do to make sure that we're not losing?
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.600]   We're not losing the audience here?
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.780]   - So what I think we should do is to remember
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.680]   that the future is always uncertain.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.660]   And anytime you're convinced
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.840]   that you know what's coming for sure,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.860]   you're going to be wrong.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.460]   And that's true at both extremes.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.500]   If I'm certain it's the end of the world,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.020]   or I'm certain it's unicorns and rainbows,
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.980]   I'm gonna be wrong.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.980]   And so we have to realize that our own imagination
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.400]   of the future is a function of our own level of confidence,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.860]   that we're the ones who paint the image.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.280]   And to be very careful
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.780]   when we can't imagine a different picture,
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.620]   because the more you can't imagine that other picture,
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.700]   the more likely that other picture is going to be.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.300]   So I think you wanna be prepared for all pictures.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   And this is where as an investor,
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.240]   you wanna recognize that things are uncertain
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.360]   and allow for possibility
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.700]   both good and bad in your portfolios.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:39.280]   - So in other words, I guess emotion is huge to investing.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.320]   And I think people will go through
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.560]   these emotional roller coasters
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.360]   when they make so much and lose so much.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.880]   And perhaps it's to obviously diversify,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.280]   look at your risk tolerance
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.580]   and not get too caught up in the ups and downs,
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.720]   like many people did in 2021, for example.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.940]   - Yeah, you wanna avoid those extremes in emotion,
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.720]   either being terribly optimistic or terribly pessimistic,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.040]   because we make our worst financial decisions
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.240]   in those two moments.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.840]   And I think it's, again,
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   remember that you are encoded biologically, physiologically
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.400]   to behave in ways that makes investing
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.140]   completely counterintuitive.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.760]   Successful investing means running into the fire
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.480]   and getting out of the bar
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.400]   where the champagne is being tossed around.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.020]   And we don't, that's hard.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.680]   That's hard to do exactly the opposite
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.440]   of what our gut is telling us to do.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.940]   But if we can just avoid those two bad decisions,
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.940]   we're gonna be much better off
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.460]   because we do them in too big a scale,
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.380]   in too definitive a way.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.260]   We sell out everything at the lows
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.980]   and we put everything in at the top.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.020]   And just avoiding those two moments
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.060]   gives us much better long-term success.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.900]   - Right.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.620]   What do you think are the reasons
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.920]   why we are so emotional?
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.100]   Because what is our end game?
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.660]   What is our end game to investing in your opinion?
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.020]   What are all your students hoping to accomplish
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.140]   in 30 years?
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.060]   - Yeah, the end game in investing is abundance.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:34.100]   And I say abundance generally because it could be money,
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.700]   it could be power, it could be choice.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.320]   There are a lot of stories that we associate with wealth
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.060]   that aren't really about wealth.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.200]   And if we can step back and identify
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.900]   what's the abundance we're looking for,
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.500]   then we can also identify the scarcity
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.280]   that we're afraid of on the other side,
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.820]   because that's where we get really emotional.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.740]   If we don't have enough of what it is
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.780]   that matters most to us,
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.940]   then we become very impulsive and very emotional.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.540]   And that's when we do, we make bad choices.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.620]   - And do you think that fear of scarcity
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.740]   is overdone here in America in the land of abundance?
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.660]   - I think we lack an appreciation
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.220]   for the relative abundance that we have
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.500]   versus a lot of the rest of the world,
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.780]   but appreciate that this is an environment
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.780]   where comparison is so easy and is never ending.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.620]   And I think one of the real downsides
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.740]   to social media today is the comparisons
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.460]   that people are making to those
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.420]   who are demonstrating confidence theater out,
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:03.620]   in such a grotesque manner that we feel inferior.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.020]   And that inferiority is driving people again
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.020]   to making decisions that they would be wise not to.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.100]   - Yeah, it's so interesting 'cause I grew up in Zambia,
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.660]   Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan,
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.340]   and some of the countries like Malaysia in the 80s,
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.380]   there's not a lot of abundance,
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.540]   or there's a huge dichotomy between the wealthy
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.980]   and the poor.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.700]   And so when I come to America for high school,
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.500]   I'm impressed with how well off the general population is.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.140]   And it seems like we take it for granted
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.260]   how good we have it, the clean water, the food,
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.620]   the internet access, stable government.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.500]   And I wish more of us would just see the world more.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.900]   - And one of the things that that requires
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.140]   is a sense of confidence.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.140]   Travel is, particularly to places that are unfamiliar to us,
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.860]   requires a level of confidence to begin with.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.420]   And so in a lot of the work that I do,
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.420]   I focus a great deal on are people traveling,
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.780]   where are they traveling?
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.900]   Because that is itself a reflection of mood,
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.500]   but I agree with you to the extent
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.620]   that you can see things that are unfamiliar,
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:21.620]   the people, places, it also creates a level of resilience
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:27.220]   because you've learned how to navigate what is unfamiliar.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.220]   And those skills, again, are transferable
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.900]   to other moments in your life.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.860]   - Tell me a little bit about your children in their 20s.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.660]   I guess if you could rewind time
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.820]   to when they were 10 or eight or 15,
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.500]   is there anything you would have done differently
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.820]   in terms of teaching them or anything?
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:52.900]   - I think I would have encouraged them
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.100]   to have experiences where they fail more often,
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:03.340]   to appreciate that not succeeding
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.100]   is an important skill to learn.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.340]   Not only does it foster empathy,
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.340]   but it also teaches them skills
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.020]   that become very useful later in life.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.020]   I tell my students, fail early and often.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:28.220]   Learn where the consequences of loss are,
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.420]   very low on a relative basis.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.500]   I encourage them, take an improv course,
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.580]   you do things that push you out of the comfort zone.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:43.540]   We have a lot of high-performing young people
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.580]   who some of them have never gotten to be.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:51.160]   And that's a really bad experience.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:58.140]   When you get that in your 20s and not eight and nine,
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.940]   you just get used to not succeeding.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.460]   And often it's a very motivating,
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:09.220]   it's gonna push you in other ways.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.420]   - Well, tell me about that B,
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.740]   because I remember trying to get straight A's
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.060]   as an economics major at William & Mary, and I couldn't.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.340]   It was just so hard.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.840]   I tried so hard and I couldn't get it.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.220]   So as a professor, how much power do you have to say,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.140]   you know what, Bob or Jane, you tried really hard.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.140]   You didn't quite get it on the test,
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.580]   but you've got it at the end, but not on the test,
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.220]   but you explained it to me, you understand the concepts.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.540]   Can you say, okay, I'll give you an A
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.660]   for who you are based on what you've learned,
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.820]   or is it very rigid?
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.580]   How does that process work?
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.860]   - Oh, I don't think there's a universal,
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.660]   from professor to professor.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.900]   In a lot of the work that I do, Sam,
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.420]   I grade things anonymously.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.180]   So I have no idea whose paper is whose,
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.140]   or whose test is whose, and that I found to be very helpful
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.980]   because unknowingly we bring a lot of bias
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.720]   to how we read things.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:11.820]   And so it's helpful to disassociate the voices in class
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.380]   with what's on paper.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.860]   - But let me ask you this though,
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.360]   which is, I think it's good to be objective
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.940]   in your grading, but what about the student that says,
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.940]   Peter, Professor Atwater, I would love to meet with you
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.220]   at office hours, once a week.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.860]   And so you develop a relationship, you get to know them,
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.940]   they're trying hard.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.820]   There has to be some kind of behavioral or bias
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.660]   towards that student who's trying harder than the others.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:42.140]   - You know, at the end of the day, it's about outcomes.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:47.140]   And helping them to realize that they've made progress,
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.940]   that what they've learned in that process
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.160]   is gonna help them.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.980]   And I've often had students who've done poorly
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.820]   for whom I've written tremendous recommendations
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:04.380]   to graduate school, to say, you know, here's the grade,
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.660]   you know, student got a B or a C, you know,
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.100]   but that doesn't tell the story of what they did.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.700]   And I think those are really powerful.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.380]   And at the same time, I've had students who've gotten A's
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.020]   that have come and asked for a review and I've said,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.780]   you got an A, great.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.320]   That's all I know about you.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.780]   - Well, that tells me that making the effort
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.060]   to make a connection with your professors,
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.680]   your colleagues, your bosses, your readers,
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.220]   your listeners matter.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.980]   People wanna help people they like.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.900]   - It matters hugely.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.140]   And again, it comes back to confidence.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.460]   If we have a relationship and you're familiar to me,
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.460]   then, you know, there's trust, there's confidence
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.300]   and, you know, there's strength in that.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.700]   - And it's one of those things, again,
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.780]   in our world of 24/7, you know,
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.420]   friends that are thousands of miles away online,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.900]   we don't, there are a lot of young people
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.900]   who don't have those relationships right there with them
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:11.000]   that you're physically proximate.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.500]   Those people who will come to your side
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.780]   in a crisis that we need in life.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.620]   - Yeah.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.740]   You know, when I was younger, I always heard,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.340]   oh, networking is so important, office politics, all that.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.820]   And it really run me the wrong way.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.140]   But as I get older, I see the value of those relationships
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.780]   because as you get older, you gain more friendships,
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.620]   deeper friendships, and you can just call your friends
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.380]   and say, can you help me with this?
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.220]   Or, you know, your cardiologist friend
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.500]   or our professor friend in behavior economics
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.580]   or podcasting, you know, it's just,
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.300]   it's unbelievable what your network can do to help you.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.660]   - Yeah, and to remember that asking for help
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.980]   isn't weakness, it's taking control of the situation.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.980]   It's one of the first steps that we should take,
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.540]   but many, many people are afraid to ask for help
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.840]   because somewhere in the back of their head,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.020]   they're hearing that's weakness, that's not,
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.980]   I should be better equipped, I should know better.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.340]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.020]   You know, asking for help is taking control.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.980]   - I wanted to ask you one final question on the book
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.660]   and that's, I thought it made a lot of sense.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.740]   You said it was like the hidden, the horizon map.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.580]   - Yeah. - Was that right?
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.740]   The horizon map.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.660]   And can you tell the listeners what is the horizon map
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.420]   and how does it affect your decisions and your confidence?
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.260]   - Sure, I call it horizon preference,
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.940]   which is to say that how we feel
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:45.560]   affects how deep out into the world we look.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.200]   If you, and I think we're almost,
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.000]   we've been filled with variable lens goggles
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.520]   that are a function of our level of confidence.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.320]   As I said, when we are vulnerable, we're forced to focus
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.920]   and focus isn't just this intense aim
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.480]   at what's in front of us,
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.480]   it's also the elimination of everything around us
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.280]   that's not important.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.320]   And so it's like we fog out anything
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.200]   that's not right here, that me here now.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.680]   I'm gonna fog out tomorrow,
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.120]   I'm gonna fog out other people, other places.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   As our confidence rises, that fog abates
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.980]   and we can see further ahead.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.800]   We can see into the future,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.880]   we can see comfortably into other places.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.480]   And that impacts then the kinds of choices we make.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.660]   I'm gonna start planning for tomorrow.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.000]   I might even be planning to take a trip in two years time
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.560]   to a place I've never been to before.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.700]   And that change in preference
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.000]   is impacting all of our decisions at once.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.280]   We're gonna be more social,
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.520]   we're gonna be more collaborative when we feel confident
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.440]   because our world is bigger
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.920]   and things that were once very psychologically distant
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.360]   to us now feel familiar.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.900]   And that is a really useful tool
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.900]   to assess how people are dealing with the world.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.180]   If I'm dealing with you, Sam,
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.040]   and you've just been in an accident,
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.220]   I need to know that you are in me here now mode.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:33.220]   And so any suggestions, all of my conversations
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.320]   need to be focused around you in that moment.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.660]   They're telling you that everything's gonna be better
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.740]   in a year, you're gonna look at me like, you don't get me.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.060]   So I need to be talking about what do you need
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.180]   for you to feel better right now
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:53.920]   because I wanna help you to eliminate the vulnerability
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.180]   that you feel in that moment.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:01.180]   And so realizing how confidence affects our interests
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.580]   and our needs, I think,
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.120]   enables us to communicate more effectively.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.380]   If I'm in marketing, it helps me to sell things
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.700]   more persuasively, but it's a really important way
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.420]   of assessing how people feel is how big's your world.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.620]   I remember one year I asked folks,
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.620]   I give them a picture that has the word me
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.020]   in the middle of a bullseye
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.720]   and said, draw the world around you.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.000]   And that's all I say.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.140]   And some do it geographically, some do it socially,
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.720]   some different ways.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   One student drew a picture of his feet on this
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.060]   and I was like, that's interesting.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.860]   And so I pulled him aside after class,
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.840]   I said, so what's going on?
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   And he said, when I think of the world around me,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.880]   I look down.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.700]   And his world was incredibly small.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.360]   That's how he looked at things.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.260]   And I immediately wondered, everything okay.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.400]   You're telling me in this picture
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.300]   that your confidence is very low
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:14.140]   because if your world is just your feet and nothing more,
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.420]   you're very inward.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.340]   And what can we do to help you to feel more confident,
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.060]   to make your world feel bigger, become bigger?
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:28.080]   - And what was his answer and how did you help him?
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.580]   - So he acknowledged that, yeah,
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.260]   he was a first semester freshman.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.260]   It had been a rocky start.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.440]   And we talked about ways that he could,
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.320]   how could he build his network,
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.000]   find his people on campus,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.320]   the folks that would ultimately become very good friends.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.160]   - Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.360]   That's good to ask a question, a simple question
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.000]   and let people figure it out on their own
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.120]   to self-discovery.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.040]   That's great.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.880]   Well, thank you so much, Peter, for your time.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.580]   For anybody who wants to read and buy "The Confidence Map,"
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.100]   where can they pick up the book?
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.180]   - Book is available online now.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.420]   It's also available in a lot of local bookstores
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.660]   and I encourage folks to please support
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.700]   your local bookstores.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.340]   They're vitally important today.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.660]   - Yeah, and congratulations for working with Noah.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:22.220]   He's our fellow editor at Portfolio Penguin Random House.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.380]   - I feel very blessed.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.420]   - Yeah, I know that you went through some revisions
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.540]   and different iterations
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.500]   and he helped push you to the finish line.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.320]   So that was great.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.820]   Shout out to Noah.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.940]   Well, thanks so much, Professor Atwater
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.180]   and congratulations on your book
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.480]   and thank you for spending time
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.080]   on the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.220]   - I really appreciate it, Sam.
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.380]   Thanks so much.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:42.220]   - Take care.
