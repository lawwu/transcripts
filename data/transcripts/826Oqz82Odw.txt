[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   So that's our plan.
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.360]   So let's get started with the deep dive.
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.880]   So the topic of the deep dive today is the deep reset.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.880]   Now the deep reset is a term I introduced
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.960]   in my email newsletter and talked about briefly
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.160]   on this podcast back in the early months
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.940]   of the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.540]   I wanna revisit it today and make it more structured,
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.140]   make it more pragmatic.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.880]   So to understand the deep reset,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.240]   I wanna talk about three different forces
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.340]   that exist in the world today
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.680]   that I think are gonna converge together
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.860]   to create this new phenomenon.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.420]   So if you're watching instead of listing,
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.460]   so if you're watching the video of this segment
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880]   at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.480]   you'll see I have the tablet up here
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.440]   where I've listed three different forces,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.200]   and I'm gonna write right in the middle here,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.140]   deep reset, 'cause these all,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.960]   hand lays, beautiful,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.600]   these all are feeding into the deep reset.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.680]   All right, so what are the forces
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.960]   that I think are gonna feed into this thing
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.280]   I'm gonna call the deep reset?
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.760]   First, the fact that millennials
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.900]   are approaching middle age.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.720]   So let's be precise about demographics here.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.120]   People use these generation descriptions,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.840]   I believe, too vaguely.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.440]   Like we're in the bad habit, for example,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.880]   of using the word millennial to mean young person,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.240]   but let's be very demographically specific here.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   The millennials, by most accounts,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   are more or less people born between 1981 and 1996.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.760]   So that puts Jesse and I at the older end
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.300]   of the millennials, so we're 40.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.040]   The youngest millennials are in their late 20s.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.800]   The bulk of this generation is in their 30s right now.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.500]   So these are more or less the children of the baby boomers.
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.880]   All right, so the millennials are approaching middle age.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.780]   Jesse and I are older,
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.940]   but the rest of them are going through their 30s.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.480]   This is a very important cultural shift
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.200]   because the millennials is a very large population boom.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.720]   The baby boomers was a very large population boom,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.120]   so their children is itself gonna be a very large boom.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.480]   That's why our demographic was originally called
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.640]   the echo boom, because it was an echo of the baby boom.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.780]   So we have this very large group population demographic
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.580]   that are now approaching middle age,
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.640]   which means those that are gonna end up,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.520]   let's say, getting married or starting a family,
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.540]   they're doing that right now.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.280]   All right, number two, second of three forces,
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.760]   relevant in the world right now,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.160]   is the philosophy of work as a means to an end
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.560]   that the millennials have developed
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.260]   over the past, let's say, 20 years.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.040]   So we got into this briefly
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.440]   in my deep dive from episode 218.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.920]   So just to give you the short summary here,
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.040]   when the millennials were growing up,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.560]   so this was the 1990s into the early 2000s,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.680]   when the first millennials were growing up,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.280]   their parents, the baby boomers,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.840]   wanted to offer them advice
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.120]   about what to do with their career.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.800]   Now, the baby boomers had these two extreme experiences.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.520]   When they were little, they had seen their parents
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.080]   had had this sort of corporate conformist experience.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.360]   This was the era of the organization man.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.640]   This was the 1950s in which you moved to the suburbs
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.500]   and you dedicated your life to IBM
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.520]   and they would give you lifetime employment in return.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.720]   As people left this urban cores of cities
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.320]   and small villages, these corporate loyalties
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.840]   became a substitute for civic engagement.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.520]   So it was a time of conformity,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.800]   but it also sort of made sense.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.540]   These are the same people who had subordinated themselves
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.040]   to the larger cause of fighting fascism
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   during World War II.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.480]   So they were used to this idea,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   subordinate yourself to the larger cause
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.660]   as a source of meaning.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.160]   The baby boomers didn't buy that
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.960]   because by the time you get to the '60s,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.840]   you have all these social disruptions happening.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.120]   You have the civil rights movement, you have Vietnam,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   you have the women's liberation movement,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   all of these social forces,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.280]   these social disruptions are happening.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.360]   And suddenly their parents ethos
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.920]   seemed stiflingly conformist.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.160]   And so the baby boomers created
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.900]   the counter-cultural movement,
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.740]   which went hard the other way.
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.280]   So now we had, let's get rid of work altogether.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.220]   It's an obstacle to self-actualization.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.720]   Let's go back to land, let's move to communes.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   You're gonna find yourself outside of work.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.760]   That fell apart too.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.120]   So by the time the baby boomers were having kids,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.280]   like how do we balance these two forces?
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.240]   And they came up with, I think at the time,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.040]   a clever innovation.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.420]   We'll tell our kids to follow their passion.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.580]   See, this is a tightrope act right here.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.560]   The counter-culture idea of forget work,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.840]   just go move to a commune and self-actualize,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.680]   that didn't work.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.320]   But they also still distrusted pure corporate conformity.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.840]   So they had this compromise.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.840]   All right, you still need to get a job
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.460]   and pay your mortgage payments and make a living,
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.240]   but make it a job you love.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.840]   So now the job itself can be a source
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.280]   of meaning and fulfillment.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.140]   So this is what we saw as millennials.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.040]   We were taught this idea of follow your passion.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.200]   That then fell apart.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.400]   And again, I talked about this last week,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.020]   but that then fell apart in the early 2000s.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.920]   We had 9/11, the financial crash after 9/11.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.240]   We barely got back on our feet
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.660]   before the 2008 financial crash happened.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.120]   This was the period when the bulk
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.440]   of the millennial generation was leaving college
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.920]   and entering the workforce.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.960]   This idea that you should just follow your passion,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.400]   that idea began to lose steam.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000]   Employment seemed much more precarious.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   The instrumental value of money to stave off hardship
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.280]   and support things that are meaningful
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.200]   became much more clear
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.520]   when people were going through hard times.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.540]   And so the millennials in general moved past
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.700]   the follow your passion notion
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.060]   and began to work on an alternative philosophy
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.200]   of work as a means to an end.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.560]   This is the hack work culture.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.820]   This is what's captured in the minimalism movement.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.620]   This is what's captured in Tim Ferriss' lifestyle design.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.780]   This is what's captured in the fire movement.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.060]   This is what's captured in early influencer videos
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.620]   on Instagram and YouTube,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.580]   where you see millennials focusing on lifestyle.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.680]   It's the moms in the white linen dresses
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.380]   walking through the fields with their kids.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.640]   It's the sort of impossibly ripped dads
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.320]   doing feats of endurance in YouTube videos.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.760]   The lifestyles being pushed to the millennials
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.660]   by millennials, it was not about work.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.660]   It was meaning in life.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.420]   Work was a funding source for running endurance races
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.020]   and having only white dishes on white shelves
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.400]   in your walls at your house.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.540]   So that's this big shift.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.380]   The millennials are very attuned to this idea
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.540]   that follow your passion, forget that.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.180]   Work supports other things that are important.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.340]   It's a source of money.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.180]   We can take it.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.000]   Maybe you'll get some mean out of it.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.840]   Maybe you don't like your job,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.740]   but it's a financial backing
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.340]   for the systematic construction of a life that's meaningful.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.500]   So we've adopted that.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.540]   And this is very generational.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.780]   Gen Z, for example, the generation born after 1996,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.220]   who's just now entering the workforce,
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.860]   as we talked about last week, they have their own ideas.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.700]   They're right now,
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.340]   they're stuck on this notion of quiet quitting.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.460]   They're just taking the first basic steps of saying,
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.900]   what is work gonna mean to us?
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.160]   But for the millennials, we've been through this.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.060]   Work is a means to an end.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.840]   All right, so millennials approaching middle age,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.680]   millennials adopting a work as a means to the end philosophy.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.340]   And then we add the third element,
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.060]   the catalyst to this particular
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.300]   metaphorical biochemical mixture,
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.680]   and that is pandemic disruptions.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.140]   So the pandemic comes along, disrupts work.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.640]   Everything goes remote.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.180]   The pain points that people feel with their jobs
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.860]   are amplified.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.180]   At the same time,
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.460]   the idea that you have more freedom and flexibility
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.620]   in configuring your work and your life was also amplified.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.900]   People were moving.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.280]   They were doing different schooling configurations
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   with their kids.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.860]   They were pushing back on things.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.260]   People were leaving jobs.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.760]   There's this spirit of, hey, anything can go.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.300]   Things are so bad
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.260]   that there's really nothing off the table now.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.260]   And it inculcated this idea of change is possible.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.960]   So I think those three things are gonna come together
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.820]   for this particular generation
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.700]   to lead to a lot of people to engage
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.980]   in what I call a deep reset.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.740]   So I have a definition for this.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.140]   I'm scrolling up if you're watching this online.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.800]   Here's a definition of a deep reset.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.880]   It's an intentional reconfiguration of your life
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.680]   to amplify the small number of things
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.720]   you've learned through experience that you value
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   and minimize those things that get in their way.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.200]   So a deep reset is saying, wait a second,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.160]   let's step back and reconfigure our whole life.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.700]   And I think at this moment,
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.240]   the millennials in particular,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.080]   because of those three forces coming together,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.720]   have begun doing these deep resets.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.320]   And this is gonna be a very important work trend
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.740]   in the next handful of years that are coming up ahead.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.680]   Now I wanna point out,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.440]   this is different than a midlife crisis,
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.800]   which is a phenomenon that afflicted our parents.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.160]   The midlife crisis came at a similar point in people's lives
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.840]   as their 30s went into their 40s,
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.240]   but it was much more haphazard,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.320]   self-focused and less intentional.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.120]   The midlife crisis was famously characterized
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.740]   by people realizing, oh my God, my life is halfway done.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.040]   What am I doing?
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.760]   Let me respond haphazardly.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.540]   I'll buy a sports car.
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.580]   I'll get divorced and married a 25 year old.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.920]   I'll do a dramatic sort of visible
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.980]   narcissistic lifestyle changes to try to distract
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.660]   or stave off or avoid the inevitable conclusion
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.700]   that I'm getting older.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.460]   That's very different than the deeper reset,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.460]   which is much more intentional,
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.880]   much more focused on your whole life, your whole family,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.720]   much more focused on amplifying meaning,
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.020]   not avoiding things that are distressing.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.060]   So what might go into a deeper reset?
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.900]   Well, here are some things I've seen.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.960]   Work simplification is a big part of that.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.080]   So people really rethinking the role of work.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.020]   So we get a lot of, for example, lead stepping.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.980]   That's a term for where you've been going up the ladder
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.740]   at your organization and you say, you know what?
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.960]   I'm fine where I am right now for a while.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.580]   Let me step off the ladder onto a ledge
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.420]   where I can just hang out.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.860]   So without the need to strive to get to the next level,
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.900]   it reduces the pressure and the amount of work on your plate.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.300]   So as you approach middle age as a millennial,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.740]   you may already have a lot of career capital,
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.020]   have a really a job that's at that right balance.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.560]   You have a lot of leverage, a lot of autonomy.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   It's probably a reasonable place
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.540]   where you could let step for a while
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.880]   without it being boring or as it would be
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.000]   if you tried when you're 22
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.540]   and you're still in an entry-level position.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.680]   So we definitely see work simplification.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.920]   People also going all remote
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.800]   could be a work simplification move.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.620]   Reduced hours is a work simplification move.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.920]   Freelancers or people running small businesses,
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.780]   eliminating streams of income,
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.920]   the focus on just a smaller number of things
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   is work simplification.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.160]   So it's all about reducing that work volume
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.520]   that's coming at you from your job.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.040]   That's common in deep resets.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.400]   A term that I just made up,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.760]   but I'm trying to popularize,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.640]   candle fire, capital F-I-R-E,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.040]   goes along with this.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.080]   So FIRE is this millennial movement,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.120]   financial independence, retire early,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.480]   that we've talked about on the show before.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.940]   And it was a movement that came out of the tech world
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.560]   about super aggressively saving
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.160]   while living aggressively cheaply
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.040]   so that you could achieve financial independence
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.120]   at a relatively young age.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.800]   What I think we're seeing a lot more of now
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.840]   is what I call candle fire,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.120]   the candle being referenced to a small flame,
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.480]   in which the idea is not,
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.180]   oh, I need to be financially independent.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.540]   That is, I can live entirely off of my saved assets,
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.360]   but instead, let's bring down our cost of living
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   substantially so that with a simplified work portfolio,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.320]   we can still support ourselves.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.400]   So it's not leaving work
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.360]   and living entirely off your investments.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.220]   It's moving to the cheaper location,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.840]   getting rid of one of the cars,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.200]   moving to the cheaper location.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   We're homeschooling instead of private school.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.340]   Our expenses are lower,
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.600]   so now I don't have to work as much,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.980]   but I'm going to leverage the fact
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.240]   that I have a lot of career capital.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.380]   I'm 35, I know what I'm doing, I'm in demand.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.220]   It's not that hard for me
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.040]   to negotiate a part-time contractor position.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.880]   It's half the money.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.840]   I live on half the expenses, and there we go.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.400]   We have a nice life with a lot less work.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.520]   So candle fire, we're gonna see a lot of that.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.880]   That's gonna go alongside work simplification.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.120]   Relocation is big.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.160]   We saw a lot of this during the pandemic.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.680]   I call it intentional relocation
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.200]   'cause it's moving for intentional value-based reasons.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.740]   Two examples from my own life.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.640]   We have friends who were kind of overwhelmed
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.040]   by the crowdedness and the stress
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.460]   of the Washington, D.C. suburbs.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.040]   Both their jobs were remote for the most part.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.460]   They really like outdoor activities.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.860]   They really like skiing.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.340]   God help them.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.280]   They were trying to get their skiing in each year
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.440]   in West Virginia.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.080]   There's only so many mountains around here.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.000]   They're not that great.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.980]   And so they moved to Colorado, right outside Boulder,
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.540]   half hour from a great ski slope,
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.980]   mount the bike all the time, intentional relocation.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.660]   Another friend of mine worked for the government,
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.260]   was a lawyer for the government.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.380]   They're enjoying life here,
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.500]   but his family was from Santa Fe,
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.720]   and they're like a long-running Santa Fe family,
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.340]   sort of like his family runs the town.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.640]   They've been there since you were fighting off
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.380]   Indian raid-type things.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.820]   And they were all there.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.300]   So he negotiated like, hey, in the height of the pandemic,
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.060]   when anything went, he negotiated a permanent remote work,
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.060]   and they moved to Santa Fe.
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.900]   He sends me photos.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.820]   He has a cool Adobe style house with a hill in the backyard.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.060]   There's a gazebo at the top of it.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.440]   He goes up there to watch the sunset.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.820]   All of his family's there.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.660]   It's all thickly connected connections,
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.660]   intentional relocation.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.740]   You're gonna see a lot more of that.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.940]   We will also see deep community involvement.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.820]   This is something else that happens in deep resets,
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.900]   where people get deeply involved in communities
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.600]   that are meaningful for them.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.900]   This could be family communities.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.980]   Like my friend who moved back to Santa Fe
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   is now deeply connected to all sorts of different relatives.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.260]   They're in each other's lives.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.440]   There's pluses and minuses,
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.100]   but generally we're a familial tribal species,
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.340]   so that's usually positive.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.780]   Sometimes it'll be, let's say like a faith-based community.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.140]   I'm gonna get really seriously involved in my temple,
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.680]   right, in my whatever, my mosque.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.460]   Maybe it's more like an activist community.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.860]   This is a cause that's important to me,
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.340]   and I'm gonna get deeply involved in it.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.780]   So we're seeing more of investment
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.060]   of amplifying time spent in things like that that are useful.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.460]   And then finally, deep play and self-development.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.900]   People dedicating serious time to,
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.620]   it might be leisure activities.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.500]   I mean, I think my brother is an example of this.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.380]   Outdoor activities, in particular mountain-based activities
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.300]   are really important to him,
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.500]   and they've really built a lifestyle
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.500]   that involves lots of trips to the mountains,
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.980]   hiking, alpine skiing, mountain biking,
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.340]   trail running, and he's built the way his life works,
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.220]   his schedule, to do a lot of that.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.780]   But you might see this with other types
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.460]   of self-development as well.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.840]   Someone, you know, I'm really going to invest in philosophy.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.660]   I wanna become an expert on this type of philosophy,
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.760]   health and fitness.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.500]   I'm gonna spend a lot of time outside.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.780]   I'll give you one more example.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.460]   There's a writer who wrote the book.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.200]   His name's Christopher McDougall.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.860]   He wrote the book "Born to Run,"
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.100]   which was a surprise bestseller
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.100]   that started the barefoot or Vibram shoe running craze.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.940]   And it's a cool book about a New York-based reporter
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.060]   who runs a lot and just was trashing his knees.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.300]   And he goes and spends time
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.160]   with this native tribe in Mexico
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.380]   that do these long endurance runs.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.620]   It's a tradition, and they do it barefoot.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.820]   And he goes down this rabbit hole and, you know,
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.220]   finds out that, okay, actually barefoot movement's
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.100]   what we're meant to do.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.660]   And you put in these big cushioned shoes,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.140]   you get hurt, et cetera.
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.160]   Anyways, he writes this book, "New York-Based Reporter."
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.340]   Ends up really getting into this type of stuff,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.900]   relocates to a farm.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.060]   I believe he's in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.100]   so an Amish country.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.580]   And it's this farm with this barn.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.820]   And there's these videos of him
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.620]   that Outside Magazine did, you can find,
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.100]   where he's out there now barefoot
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.780]   doing these Rocky Four style physical training activities,
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.700]   climbing ropes in his barn and throwing hay bales around.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.220]   Then he built this life
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.980]   that has a huge amount of physical activity in it,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.340]   outside, interesting physical activity.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.140]   All these are examples of the same point.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.180]   Investment, almost radical investment,
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.680]   in this case in deep play or self-development.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.740]   These are the type of things that you're gonna see
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.780]   when people conduct a deep reset.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.020]   It's simplification, amplification,
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.420]   usually with a couple of these changes made more radical.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.580]   You can have some radical moves in here,
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.900]   typically as part of a deep reset.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.300]   Now, how does this connect to our discussion
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.940]   of the deep life and the systematic pursuit
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.820]   of the deep life?
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.620]   The pursuit of a deep life will probably lead you
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.140]   to something like a deep reset.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.860]   A lot of people are coming to this more haphazardly.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.940]   It's Christopher McDougall moving to that barn,
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.820]   my friends moving to Colorado.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.980]   People are coming at this a little bit more haphazardly.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.500]   We try to be more systematic about it here on the show.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.200]   But my point is, regardless of what we talk about here,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.740]   I think deep resets are something we're gonna see
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.420]   as a defining characteristic of the millennials
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.580]   in their 30s and early 40s.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.340]   And I, for one, think it's a positive trend.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.900]   I think it's a nuanced and sophisticated approach
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.460]   to thinking about life, the relationship between work
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.340]   and other elements of life.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.420]   I think our parents' generation struggled more with this.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.980]   We got more of this, "Oh my God,
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.020]   what happened to the first half of my life?
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.300]   Let's buy a Corvette," type reaction.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.340]   Because this new generation had this long period
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.820]   of developing a work as a means to an end ethic.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.860]   They were ready for the disruptions of the pandemic.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.400]   They were ready for the distress
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.620]   and wake up call of middle age.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.180]   So we have a bit of perfect storm of forces coming together
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.380]   to create a phenomenon that I think is gonna be
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.900]   quite positive, actually, when we look back at it
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.820]   for my particular cohort.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.980]   There you go, Jesse.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.980]   I wrote an essay on the deep reset in my newsletter.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.380]   You can find it at calnewport.com
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.640]   real early on in the pandemic.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.820]   But it was way more sort of poetic and emotional.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.940]   So it was just feeling,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.500]   it's an interesting document to go back and read
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.300]   'cause it was projecting this feeling that was in the air
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.460]   of, "I think changes are coming.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.260]   People are gonna make big changes."
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.380]   But it was clearly not really worked out yet.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.700]   And I think two years, or whatever it's been now,
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.780]   since then, two and a half years,
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.060]   starting to see this shake out
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.460]   into something that's a little bit more clear,
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.540]   a little bit more systematic.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.060]   So yeah, I'm a big fan of the deep reset.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.540]   I think a lot of people wanna do this.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.460]   So hopefully having some terminology helps.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.700]   - This'll probably be a chapter in the next book, right?
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.540]   - Yeah.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.780]   I mean, the "Deep Life" book is all kind of about this.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.620]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.900]   In fact, the deep reset was
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.420]   one of the early titles for the book.
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.560]   So it was gonna be more prescriptive.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.360]   Like, here's how to do a deep reset.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.260]   And then we changed the deep life.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.660]   I'm not quite sure exactly how I'm gonna tackle that book.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.780]   And I like that.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.820]   Like, I'm just letting ideas flow
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.300]   as I work on slow productivity.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.740]   And then as slow productivity finishes,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.540]   I'm gonna laser lock and see,
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.780]   like, what do I really wanna do here?
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.700]   - So with the definition,
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.300]   an intentional reconfiguration of one's life
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.660]   to amplify the small number of things that you've learned,
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.940]   is that to benefit your work?
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.700]   - So when I say, okay, I have it up here.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.500]   Amplify the small number of things you've learned
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.220]   through experience that you value.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.340]   So what I'm trying to emphasize there
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.420]   is that the millennials are old enough now
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.860]   to have a experience-based answer
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.020]   to the question of what's important to me.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.100]   - Outside of work.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.560]   - Outside of work, in work, in life in general.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.380]   Whereas I think if you're 23,
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.420]   and you're trying to say, what's important to me,
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.700]   you're basically making some guesses.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.520]   You don't really know.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.460]   You haven't gone through the ups and downs.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.820]   You haven't gone through the various challenges.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.300]   So really, by the time you get to, let's say, 35,
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.980]   you're probably pretty well-equipped
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.780]   to make a good deep reset
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.060]   because you have a pretty stable understanding
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.900]   at this point.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.100]   You're far enough along in your career
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.860]   that you know what works and what doesn't,
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.220]   what you like about work, what you don't.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.060]   You have leverage.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.140]   You have career capital.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.180]   So it is kind of a critical age.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.740]   - You'll have to get your friend, Mr. Money Mustache,
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.580]   and tell him about your new term, candle fire.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.860]   - Yes, we should have Pete on.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.700]   I like him.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.880]   Let's do that.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.720]   I'll talk to him.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.560]   - Yeah.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.380]   - Yeah, it'd be cool to see what he's...
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.220]   So from what I understand,
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.380]   I was just talking to someone yesterday
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.060]   who's friends with him
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.460]   and some of the other fire characters.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.220]   A lot of them live in Longmont, Colorado.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.340]   - They're probably building.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.540]   - They're building, yeah.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.040]   They have that co-working space there.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.340]   We should, yeah, we should get an update
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.180]   on what's going on.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.140]   - And then tell him about your new term.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.780]   - Candle fire.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.180]   Yep.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.980]   I don't know if that's gonna stick.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.420]   There's a lot of fire terms, by the way.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.340]   Fat fire, light fire, thin fire.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.500]   (upbeat music)
