[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.240]   - Welcome to episode number two
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.120]   of the Bogleheads Life Stages Podcast.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.660]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.480]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.980]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.720]   Today's episode features Boglehead member 5K.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.500]   This recording was made on March 31st, 2021.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.060]   Nothing in this video should be construed
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.260]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.460]   I sit over at the Money Mustache Forum
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.640]   where it was originally designed
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.300]   to help people just add up all their expenses.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.200]   And most of the emphasis on that site
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   was helping people reduce expenses.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.280]   Where's all your money going?
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.160]   It's kind of grown to the point where now I think it's
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.480]   the tax portion of it, at least on this tab,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.120]   and it probably gets used more than the expense portion.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.760]   Expense portion's still there.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.840]   What I have right now is the example
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.080]   that's in the Bogleheads Wiki article
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.800]   on Roth IRA conversion.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.160]   So you have filing status of married filing jointly.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.200]   One person's 65, one person's age 62,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.960]   no dependents at this point.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.960]   They've got 500 bucks in interest,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   non-qualified dividends, et cetera,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.140]   11,000 qualified dividends,
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.260]   19,000 in pension income,
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.220]   and 25,000 in social security income.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.400]   So the question then is if they want to do Roth conversions,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.840]   how does the amount of Roth conversion
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.820]   affect the marginal tax rate that they will pay?
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   And it's set up by default that the amount
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.360]   of Roth IRA conversion is what it looks at.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.120]   This is just a standard Excel chart.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   So for example, if you just want to change the Y-axis
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.720]   and don't worry about negative numbers.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.680]   So a negative number in a marginal tax context here
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   would be that as the value, the X-axis value increases,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.120]   if your tax amount would decrease.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.840]   So for example, if you wanted to look at marginal rates
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   for 401(k) contributions or traditional IRA contributions,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   the more you contribute, the less there would be in tax.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.240]   So you'd get negative numbers,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.560]   but we're just looking at the positive numbers there.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.820]   So you can change the axis so it blows it up a little bit.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.400]   And it has a 50% maximum right now.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   And so if you wanted to make, change that,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.080]   you can change that also just it's standard Excel charting.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.820]   So this one says that they're very close.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.480]   Looks like they can contribute a few dollars
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.200]   at no tax whatsoever, but then it's going to jump up
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.800]   to the, what do we have here?
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.880]   15, 18 and a half percent.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.760]   So that's, what's that?
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.500]   That's somebody in the 10% bracket,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.960]   except each additional dollar makes 85 cents
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.600]   of social security taxable.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   So they're in the 18.5% and then they get to the 22.2,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.520]   which is 12% bracket with each additional dollar
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.280]   making another 85 cents of social security being taxable
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.840]   and so forth and so on.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   This peak here is the 27% marginal rate
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.720]   when now up until this point,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.920]   none of the qualified dividends were taxable,
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.180]   but now as you take more and more Roth conversion,
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.640]   you're getting 12% on each additional dollar
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.880]   of Roth conversion plus 15%
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.520]   because you've made another dollar
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.960]   of the qualified dividends taxable.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.100]   There's a little notch here because the qualified dividends
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.520]   and the ordinary income brackets don't completely align.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.800]   And then you're just simply in the 22%
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.620]   nominal tax bracket.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.160]   You know, if you wanted to look at huge amounts
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   of Roth conversions, you can change the number up here.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   This is just the X-axis increment.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.280]   And now it'll show you, okay,
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.200]   if you're looking at anywhere from zero to 500,000,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.120]   what would you be running into?
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.280]   And these four spikes here you see are,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.880]   those are the Irma tiers
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.840]   because one of our example couple was age 65
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.400]   and so subject to Irma.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.320]   For those not familiar with Irma,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.120]   the income related Medicare adjustment amount
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.320]   or some such acronym, the more you make two years later,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.280]   the more you get to pay for Medicare.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.520]   So you have all the little changes here.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.960]   I think this one, this little one right here
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.680]   is the net investment interest tax.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.080]   Not sure what this one out here is off the top of my head.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.200]   Might be some phase out.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.040]   But anyway, you can look at this
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.680]   and this gives you the actual marginal rates.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   And you see only, it's almost by exception
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.840]   that these marginal rates are exactly
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.080]   what the tax brackets are.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.400]   Now you've got the 22% in there.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.480]   You've got some 24, and then you get beyond
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.760]   some of the lower things
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.360]   and you're into the 32 and 35 and so forth.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.720]   So being able to see this in picture form,
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   I think is just a particularly useful thing.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.960]   You know, there's just lots of things you can input here.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.560]   One of them would be for the third EIP,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.440]   if you've already received it, you can put this in
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.720]   and then it says, okay, well, you're not going to,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.680]   you can't get any more.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.000]   But if for, let's say this couple had filed
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.920]   and their income was too high to receive it.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.840]   And so they want to say,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.240]   well, what if we wanted to get that this year?
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.000]   I'll change, say, okay, they have not received that.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And now you see an extra, I'll put this back.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.760]   So now this would be the phase out.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.120]   Maybe they, if they were thinking of converting
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.360]   somewhere between 90 and 120,000,
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.880]   well, they get to this point and it would show them
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.600]   that now they're going to not receive the 30 EIP
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.680]   if they push their income up that high.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.440]   So when people use this spreadsheet,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   there are a lot of notes in each of the cells,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.200]   or not all the cells, but many of them
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   with a little bit of extra information on what's going on.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.320]   So you can look at all the cells
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.400]   with a little red corner note there
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.920]   that says there's a comment in this cell
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.120]   and see what it does.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.320]   The number of dependents,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.800]   description of what makes one eligible
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.000]   for the earned income credit and so forth and so on.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.240]   And of course, when all else fails, read the instructions.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   There is an instructions tab that talks about a quick start
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.000]   so that you would enter the filing status
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.880]   in these particular cells.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.680]   And then just go down the row by row
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.800]   and all the green background cells
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.000]   is where the input goes.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.880]   The other thing is the spreadsheet is set up
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.800]   to prevent you from inadvertently over typing something.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.280]   So for example, let's just say you thought you wanted
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.360]   to put the combined salary and wages
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.800]   into that particular cell there,
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.840]   and you start typing and it says, oops,
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.760]   can't change that because it's protected.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.640]   But if you want to change something,
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.640]   then go to unprotect sheet
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.160]   and there is no password here.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   So now you could go in and you could do that.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.800]   It would wreck the calculation
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.720]   because now if you start to put a number in here,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.240]   well, it doesn't show up over here
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.440]   because you've overwritten the calculation.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.600]   So, you know, caveat user.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.840]   Generally a good idea,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.040]   unless you really want to make a change
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.920]   to keep that protected.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.000]   So that's just a quick overview
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.520]   of the tax calculation sheet.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.480]   There's, it also allows for looking
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.200]   at affordable care act items.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.160]   So if, let's say somebody has,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.680]   paying $600 a month and let's just say
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.520]   that they were going to get an advanced premium tax credit
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.040]   of 500 a month.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.720]   And then I think there's a comment here.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.120]   Yeah, you've got to go over.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.880]   And then put in your,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.840]   what was it?
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.920]   Second lowest cost silver plan there.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.920]   And it will, now it will include affordable care act.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.720]   So that's got to be an affordable care act thing in there.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.760]   Let's see, is it, was that the cliff?
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.520]   Can't remember off the top of my head,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   but anyway, it's, as I said, this,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   or maybe I didn't say it,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.000]   but this thing has probably all,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.960]   at least all of the common phase-outs,
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.960]   credits, phase-ins, it's got the IRMA, the NIIT,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.320]   the social security calculation, affordable care act.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.640]   Doesn't have, what doesn't it have?
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.680]   Doesn't have adoption credits,
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.240]   doesn't have electric vehicle credits,
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.720]   but most of the common things
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.800]   that people are going to run into,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.520]   it's like what ragu, it's in there.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   So this is probably the tab that's used the most.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.600]   Reason why it gets called the toolbox
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.280]   is it's got a bunch of other tabs.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.320]   So especially if I go over to the tab
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   towards the far right, miscellaneous calculations,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.600]   there's a whole bunch of different widgets on this.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.200]   So the first section here,
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.760]   you've got the five main financial functions,
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   future value, number of years, monthly payment,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   interest rate calculation, present value calculation.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.600]   So the idea here is you put all the things in green
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.200]   and it will then calculate the cell that's in white.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   So just a quick widget for that.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.400]   And then there's a bunch of others.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.560]   I think this is, this one is just,
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   people say, well, is it better to pay off the mortgage
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.080]   or invest?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.720]   And this one will just show if the after tax rate
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.320]   is the same, the result is identical.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:57.080]   Time to financial independence.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   So if you know what your expenses are
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.200]   and what your starting value is,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.640]   it's just a simple rate calculation.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.400]   And for those who are really into the minutiae,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.640]   it will even show you derivatives of the time
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   to FI without, or based on all these different items.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:25.320]   Evaluation of pensions.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.400]   So let me skip over this one, come down here.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.080]   So for example, if somebody has a choice
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   between getting a $600,000 lump sum versus $36,000 a year,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   then this shows the curve of mathematical indifference.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.520]   You can overlay this with all your thoughts
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.440]   about what the market might do or what your own longevity is
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.440]   or what the, whether the insurance company
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.080]   is gonna still be around to pay out an annuity.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:09.160]   But this curve shows on a pure mathematical look
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.800]   that these two are identical.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.280]   For example, if you, life expectancy is what,
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.960]   somewhere just short of 28 years,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.720]   and you assume you're gonna get 4% per year
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.960]   on your lump sum, that would be identical
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.420]   to taking the $36,000 a year pension.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:38.040]   You know, if the lump sum amount was going to be
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   significantly less, well, that would tell you that,
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.720]   you know, you're almost certainly ahead
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.400]   by choosing the annuity unless you think
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.040]   you're only going to live for five to 10 years.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:03.380]   If your lump sum is much more,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.080]   then you're almost certainly ahead
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.080]   by choosing the lump sum unless you don't think,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.760]   unless you think you're gonna just put it in a bank
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.840]   and earn 1% interest and live for 35 years.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.240]   If you're gonna have a COLA on the pension,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.800]   let's say a 3%, well, that makes it a little bit
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   tougher choice, or it makes the annuity
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.820]   that much more favorable.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.720]   So the orange curve here is with the cost
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.320]   of living adjustment, and the blue curve is without that.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.840]   Just a bunch of other widgets here.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.400]   This is the one where you ask a person,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.360]   would you rather invest $1,000 a year
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.880]   between when you're age 21 and 35,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   or $2,000 a year from age 35 for the rest of your life?
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.080]   And it turns out that the earlier you invest,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.480]   the better the results.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.860]   So it solves that calculation.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.660]   Growth in a taxable account.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.540]   So it accounts for the tax drag,
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:26.680]   and then the capital gains bite at the end.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   This does reference the Bogleheads Forum discussion.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:42.440]   If you contribute the maximum, there's a slight advantage,
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.560]   or there can be a slight advantage to Roth
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.400]   just because of the tax drag you would have to have
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   when contributing the maximum to traditional.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.240]   You can put more into the Roth.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   Now, if you take the traditional extra tax-deferred
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.960]   or tax-free amount, pre-tax amount,
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.160]   and put that into a taxable side account,
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.720]   it's going to have some amount of tax drag.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:15.080]   And then a bunch of others, which off the top of my head,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.880]   I'm not sure, and it looks like there's
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.600]   some work-in-progress stuff down here.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.440]   So that's the, I'll just go through all the other tabs
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.220]   on here fairly quickly.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:34.560]   So the very last, I'll just go from the far right,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.560]   work my way back towards the beginning.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:43.200]   So this is, oh, yeah, so back on the calculations tab,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:51.480]   everything that I showed was using 2021 tax brackets.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.960]   If anyone thinks that in 2026,
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.600]   the brackets are going to revert
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.160]   to exactly what they were in 2017,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.260]   except for inflation adjustment,
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.560]   you can go, you can, I'll show it real quick here.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.920]   Up here, you can change that 2021 to 2026.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.480]   And now you get the brackets as they would be
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.660]   if nothing else changes in the law.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.800]   I wouldn't bet a whole lot on either the 2021
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   or the 2026 numbers actually being the way the tax law
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.440]   will be when we get to 2026, but it's something.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.220]   Next tab, there's a basic terms tab.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.120]   I think this is the one for people who say,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.520]   should I invest in an index fund or a 401k?
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:59.780]   It attempts to educate people on just some basics.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.260]   Let's see.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.080]   So skipping over the miscellaneous calculations.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   So the question of if somebody is in the 12% bracket,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.600]   should they do tax gain harvesting on capital gains
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.480]   or should they take advantage of a low marginal rate
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.480]   to do Roth conversions?
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.200]   If they assume that in the future,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.240]   their marginal rate will be higher.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.160]   So you can play around with this.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.680]   Turns out from the playing I've done,
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.060]   if you think you're gonna keep the money in there
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.360]   for any significant length of time,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.580]   it works out ever so slightly better
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.400]   to do the Roth conversion,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.480]   but it's not a huge deal either way.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.360]   Usually around October timeframe, October, November,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.600]   you get a lot of questions on,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.760]   gee, should I sign up for high deductible health plan
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.740]   or not a high deductible health plan?
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.160]   And this is one of several widgets that are available
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.800]   on the internet to take a look at that.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.680]   All the insurance plans are a little different.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.920]   They get into, well, you co-pay for this,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.160]   a little bit for that,
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.160]   but it's anyway, it's a widget that will help
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:24.280]   at least in some cases for people to compare the HDHP
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.360]   with HSA to PPO or other non-HDHP without HSA.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:36.860]   The social security benefit predictor,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   put in your actual earnings and then it will go ahead
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.640]   and calculate your AIME adjusted average,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.360]   something monthly earnings.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:59.880]   And then it goes into the social security calculation
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.880]   with the two break points and comes up with your base PIA.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.440]   So this is the number that you would feed
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.440]   into something like Mike Piper's opensocialsecurity.com.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   That tool needs to know
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.160]   what the primary insurance amount is.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.680]   So you can calculate this for one person's earnings
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.800]   and then you could either make a copy of the sheet
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.760]   or just overwrite here with another person's earnings
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.360]   and get the other person's primary insurance amount
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.700]   and feed that into opensocialsecurity.com.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:46.120]   Non-deductible IRA, so this references Vogelhead's wiki.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:52.940]   And if you wanna see, I guess how that wiki table came to be,
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:58.360]   I think the wiki table was there before this spreadsheet,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.360]   but anyway, 401(k) versus taxable.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   Traditional is, or Roth is always going to be better than,
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.080]   or at least no worse than taxable,
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.720]   but then the question is where does traditional fall in?
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.440]   And so I guess if you wanted to,
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.040]   you can project out as many years as you want to
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.280]   and just see what the effects are.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.600]   Form 86, okay, this one,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.120]   you had a lot of people with a backdoor Roth IRA
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.000]   and they get into problems with form 8606
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.080]   or not that they don't get into,
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.880]   in addition to getting into problems with it,
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.340]   even worse sometimes people don't even know what it is.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:51.120]   And if you read various forum threads,
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.880]   the questions that TurboTax or H&R Block or whatever asks,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.900]   sometimes those questions are kind of confusing.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.960]   This seems to be, at least to me,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.400]   it seems much more understandable
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.160]   than some of the TurboTax questions
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.520]   having gone through that myself.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.280]   So for example, if let's say if someone,
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.560]   they're still looking at 2020 and they say,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.920]   well, okay, contributions made for this
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.980]   in this calendar year.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.520]   Well, now we're already in 2021.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.360]   So, okay, so if someone's gonna put $6,000
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.600]   into their 2020 IRA,
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.520]   well, they did it in the next calendar year
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.320]   for the 2020 tax year.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.360]   And it would say, okay, well,
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.100]   this is what your form 8606 is probably going to look like
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.060]   when you run it through tax software.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.760]   Then in 2021, if they say, okay,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.640]   I'm gonna contribute another 6,000
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.440]   and I think I'll convert
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   and maybe 50 bucks will have increased in value.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.200]   So it would say, all right,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.160]   so this is what your form 8606 should look like.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.260]   And you're gonna pay 50 bucks in tax.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:25.480]   Most, I think the tax software runs things
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.920]   through a pub for 590B worksheet 11.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:36.000]   You can force this to just use 8606.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.160]   So if someone was filling it out on their own,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.080]   they'd probably see something like this instead.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.160]   62, so alternative minimum tax
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.040]   and not many people need to worry about that.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.000]   Under current tax law, this just shows,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.600]   tax rate shows the nominal brackets,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.080]   but that's interesting on a theoretical basis,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.680]   but the calculation sheet
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.980]   with the actual marginal rates is much more interesting.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:17.320]   There is a bunch of state brackets in here.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.680]   And if I remember right, yeah,
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.280]   so this is based on the taxfoundation.org
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   publishes individual state tax rates.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.820]   So I think this is good for the brackets themselves.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.160]   And then in the state calculation,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.200]   it does have some things about what's the standard deduction
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.020]   or personal exemption,
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:50.240]   state earned income credit as a percent of federal,
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.880]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.520]   I'm sure it doesn't have every possible nuance
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.240]   in here about state taxation.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   So I think the claim is that the federal calculations
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.260]   are really, really good.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.060]   And the state calculations are probably decent,
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.440]   but again, caveat user,
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.640]   if there's something about specific pension exclusions,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.280]   depending on exactly how old you are,
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.400]   that may not be in here.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.140]   (upbeat music)
