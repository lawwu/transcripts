[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - If you think we can, can we talk about your son?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   - Yes, yes.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.480]   - Can you tell his story?
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.320]   - His story?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.420]   - Daniel.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.420]   - His story is known, he was abducted in Pakistan
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.880]   by Al-Qaeda driven sect and under various pretenses.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.600]   I don't even pay attention to what the pretense was.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.240]   Originally they wanted to have the United States
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.480]   deliver some promised airplanes.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.360]   It was all made up, all these demands were bogus.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.680]   I don't know really, but eventually he was executed
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.440]   in front of a camera.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.800]   - At the core of that is hate and intolerance.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.440]   - At the core, yes, absolutely, yes.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   We don't really appreciate the depth of the hate
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.720]   at which billions of peoples are educated.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.920]   We don't understand it.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.680]   I just listened recently to what they teach
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.280]   in Mogadishu. (laughs)
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.200]   When the water stopped in the tap,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.760]   we knew exactly who did it, the Jews.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.000]   - The Jews.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.400]   - We didn't know how, but we knew who did it.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.480]   We don't appreciate what it means to us.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   The depth is unbelievable profound.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.080]   - Do you think all of us are capable of evil?
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.240]   And the education, the indoctrination
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.080]   is really what creates evil.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.640]   - Absolutely we are capable of evil.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.640]   If you are indoctrinated sufficiently long and in depth,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.200]   we are capable of ISIS, we are capable of Nazism.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.800]   Yes, we are, but the question is whether we,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.240]   after we have gone through some Western education
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.080]   and we learn that everything is really relative,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.520]   that there's no absolute God, there's only a belief in God,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.920]   whether we are capable now of being transformed
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   under certain circumstances to become brutal.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.400]   That is a question, I'm worried about it
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.760]   because some people say yes, given the right circumstances,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.760]   given the bad economical crisis,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.560]   you are capable of doing it too.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   That worries me.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.920]   I want to believe it, I'm not capable.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.960]   - So seven years after Daniel's death,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.200]   he wrote an article at the Wall Street Journal
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.560]   titled Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.440]   What was your message back then
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.960]   and how did it change today over the years?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.240]   - I lost.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   - What was the message?
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.920]   - The message was that we are not treating terrorism
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.200]   as a taboo.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.240]   We are treating it as a bargaining device that is accepted.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.000]   People have grievance and they go and bomb restaurants.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.640]   It's normal.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.560]   Look, you're even not surprised when I tell you that.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.040]   20 years ago you say what?
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.440]   For grievance you go and blow a restaurant?
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.200]   Today it's becoming normalized, the banalization of evil.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.480]   And we have created that to ourselves by normalizing,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.000]   by making it part of a normality
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.360]   of political life.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.200]   It's a political debate.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.160]   Every terrorist yesterday becomes a freedom fighter today
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.000]   and tomorrow it becomes a terrorist again.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.840]   It's switchable.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   - And so we should call out evil when there's evil.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.240]   - If we don't want to be part of it.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.080]   - Become it.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.680]   - Yeah, if we want to separate good from evil.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.480]   That's one of the first things that,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.880]   what was it, in the Garden of Eden,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.880]   remember the first thing that God tells him
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.480]   was hey, you want some knowledge?
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.760]   Here's a tree of good and evil.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.660]   - So this evil touched your life personally.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.620]   Does your heart have anger, sadness, or is it hope?
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.460]   - I see some beautiful people coming from Pakistan.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.820]   I see beautiful people everywhere.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.820]   But I see horrible propagation of evil in this country too.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:37.180]   It shows you how populistic slogans
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.660]   can catch the mind of the best intellectuals.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.500]   - Today is Father's Day.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.460]   - I didn't know that.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.300]   - Yeah.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.140]   - I heard it.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.560]   - What's a fond memory you have of Daniel?
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.220]   - Oh, many good memories.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.980]   Immense.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.300]   He was my mentor.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.500]   He had a sense of balance that I didn't have.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.260]   (laughing)
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.740]   - Yeah.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.940]   - He saw the beauty in every person.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.420]   He was not as emotional as I am,
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.620]   more looking at things in perspective.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.740]   He really liked every person.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.820]   He really grew up with the idea that a foreigner
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.100]   is a reason for curiosity, not for fear.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.700]   At one time we went to Berkeley
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.620]   and a homeless came out from some dark alley
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.580]   and said, "Hey man, can you spare a dime?"
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.020]   I retreated back, two feet back,
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.540]   and then I just hugged him and said,
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.780]   "Here's a dime, enjoy yourself.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.780]   "Maybe you want some money to take a bus or whatever."
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.980]   Where did he get it?
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.820]   Not from me.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.220]   (laughing)
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:29.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
