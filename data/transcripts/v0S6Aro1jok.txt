[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - On Tuesday we talked about paying taxes
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.000]   to a government that funds abortions,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   and today the question is different,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.820]   although somewhat related in the ethical entailments
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.600]   of proximity.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.560]   The question comes in to us from Adam in Sydney, Australia,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.320]   who asks this, "Pastor John, as a software developer,
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.360]   "I worry my code could end up running a porn site
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.860]   "or a warplane in the future.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.500]   "Do developers of new technologies have responsibilities
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.880]   "over how an innovation may be reapplied
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.240]   "for evil in the future?
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.520]   "I think of examples like nuclear science and the atom bomb,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.920]   "or a more contemporary example
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.520]   "would be artificial intelligence
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.760]   "and sexually submissive robotics."
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.480]   So Pastor John, what advice would you have for Adam?
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.560]   - Three factors come to mind for Adam to ponder
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.800]   and take into consideration,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.480]   which I hope will give some guidance.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.980]   The first one is that some things are so good
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.060]   and so right and so necessary that we should go ahead
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.700]   and do them or speak them or create them,
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.780]   even though we are relatively sure
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.540]   they're going to be misused.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.360]   And the example in the Bible that I think about
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.060]   is Paul's doctrine of justification by faith.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.360]   He says in Romans 3.28,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.980]   "We hold that one is justified by faith
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.740]   "apart from works of the law."
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.940]   Now, when he put that doctrine forward
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.780]   among people who are hostile,
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.100]   he knew what they would do with it.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.540]   They would twist it and they would make it mean,
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.820]   "Oh, cool, I don't have to do any works."
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.820]   So Romans 3.8, "Why not do evil that good may come
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.840]   "as some people slanderously charge us
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.920]   "with saying their condemnation is just?"
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.720]   So Paul was being accused of saying,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.440]   "Let's do evil that good may come,"
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.040]   because he taught that law and law-keeping
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.200]   are not the foundation of our justification before God.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.300]   Same thing in Romans 5.20,
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.400]   "Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more."
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.480]   What then?
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.900]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.060]   By no means.
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.980]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.060]   So Paul knew on various hands,
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.300]   so did Peter, by the way,
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.140]   when grace was turned to licentiousness in 2 Peter,
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.540]   Paul and Peter knew that when they preached the truth,
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.700]   the whole counsel of God,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.260]   there were glorious aspects of it
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.540]   that would be twisted and misused
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.380]   to people's very destruction,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.700]   just like an atom bomb.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.240]   In fact, my guess is more people are in hell today
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.540]   because of the twisting of Paul's language
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.820]   than from the atom bomb.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.660]   I think I could say that
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.180]   with pretty serious degree of confidence
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.880]   that the false teaching of depending on works
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   has damned more souls than the atom bomb ever destroyed,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.780]   and yet Paul went on teaching the truth.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.420]   So I think with regard to many inventions, this is true.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.900]   I mean, maybe all of them,
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   roads, wine, hunting guns, cars, smartphones,
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.540]   hundreds of others can all be used for good
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.020]   or turned for evil.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.400]   And the potential for good, I would argue,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.860]   is worth the effort.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.900]   And those who design the good
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.340]   are not necessarily responsible for the evil.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.140]   So that's my first thing for Adam to consider.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.980]   Here's the second one.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.900]   This one's short.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.220]   A second thing to ponder
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.100]   is whether the code that he's working on, or whatever,
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.700]   that we develop and bring about
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.860]   is minimally useful for good
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.140]   and maximally useful for evil.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.500]   In other words, there's a certain proportionality
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.180]   that should figure in here.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.680]   A tiny possibility of some good
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.500]   and a huge possibility of much evil
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.660]   would, I think, cause a Christian
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.340]   to put his creative efforts in another direction.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.300]   And here's the last one,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.700]   the last factor to take into consideration.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.020]   Are there controls that can be attached
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.340]   to the invention that would limit its misuse?
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.820]   Something like patent rights or the like.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.980]   I don't know the laws here or the possibilities,
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.500]   but the principle holds
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.700]   that if you bring something into being
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.660]   that could hurt others,
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.060]   it would be justifiable and loving
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.060]   to find ways of limiting the misuse of the invention.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.220]   Here's an analogy I thought of.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.700]   Truett, Cathy, created the Chick-fil-A sandwich.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.780]   It's a good sandwich, especially the spicy one.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.780]   And he maintained such control over this sandwich
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.840]   that you can't buy one on Sunday.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.700]   Why do you do that?
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.900]   Well, he just said, "That's a use.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.320]   I don't want to be made of my sandwich.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.460]   I don't want my sandwich to be used that way.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.140]   And I don't want my stores to be used that way.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.820]   And so I'm gonna control it."
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.800]   Now, that means there are various ways
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.000]   you can use to control things.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.780]   And I think Adam should seriously consider that.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.620]   So here they are.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.620]   Let me summarize them.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.900]   Number one, the potential for great good
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.820]   is worth the risk of misuse.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.780]   Number two, small potential for good
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.340]   and great potential for evil
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.380]   would, I think, direct our energies in another way.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.380]   And third, appropriate controls on what we create
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.880]   to channel it to the best use and minimize its misuse.
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.300]   And thank you for the excellent question, Adam.

[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.900]   in epic fashion by talking about, I can't spoil it.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.740]   I'm your host, Todrick.
