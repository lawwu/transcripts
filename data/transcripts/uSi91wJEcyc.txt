[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   Do Christians carry more emotional stress than non-Christians do?
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.160]   It's a good question from Amanda, a 24-year-old listener to the podcast who writes in.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.840]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.880]   Do you think Christians feel more than unbelievers?
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.640]   Before I became a Christian, my life was challenging, of course, but I almost seemed to be numb
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.360]   or uncaring towards sin.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.040]   On becoming a Christian, and as I continue to learn more and more about the faith, I'm
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.240]   finding my emotions growing stronger and stronger.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.280]   Right now I'm walking through a season of loneliness because I no longer date unbelievers.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.160]   Now I feel like I have almost too much empathy because others' pain and troubles bring me
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.920]   to tears.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.600]   My chest becomes heavy and my soul aches as I wrestle through so many life questions.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.240]   I guess you could say God is molding me, which I'm eternally grateful for, but it has taken
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.960]   a toll on me too.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.400]   I've been encouraged to hear that a number of great Christians experience great emotional
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.000]   stress and struggle, even David in the Psalms, but it's almost paralyzing for me at times.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.580]   Is this normal?
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.160]   As Christians, we're called to have faith, confidence in Christ, and be filled with a
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.680]   joyful spirit, but now I find my spirit to be often heavy.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.200]   I guess you could say my prayer life lately.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   Sounds like Psalm 88.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.560]   Pastor John, how would you counsel Amanda?
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.800]   Well, this is a wonderful question to receive.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:42.520]   I don't mean that Amanda's heaviness is wonderful in itself, but oh my, what a refreshing problem
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.680]   to wrestle with.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.440]   The first thing I want to do is give her a big hug and say, "You are a walking miracle."
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:01.800]   Do you realize how many millions of 20-somethings are so wrapped up in their private worlds
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.320]   that almost all they do is think about how they look or how they sound to others and
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.640]   whether anyone likes them or thinks they're cool?
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.440]   Here you are, struggling to keep your spiritual nose above water because of the weight of
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.160]   empathy you feel for the suffering of others around you.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.960]   So forgive me if this sounds wonderful.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.000]   First a word about your lead question.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.160]   You say, "Do you think Christians feel more than unbelievers?"
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.520]   Well, if we only talk about natural feelings, the answer is it will vary from person to
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   person.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   Some believers will feel more than some believers, and some believers will feel more than some
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.760]   unbelievers.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.800]   But if you're talking about spiritual feelings, the kind that only the Holy Spirit can awaken,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.480]   then it is true that believers in Jesus will feel more than unbelievers.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.760]   Unbelievers don't feel any of these.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.520]   They're a miracle produced by the Spirit of God.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.160]   That's why I said, "Amanda, you're a walking miracle."
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.280]   When we are born again, the Spirit gives life to our hearts that was not there before.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.600]   We have new life.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.320]   We see Christ and his Word and his world differently, and therefore we feel Christ and his Word
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.000]   and his world differently.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.320]   Many of these new feelings will overlap with natural feelings in their appearance, and
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.120]   to the world outside will be virtually indistinguishable.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.480]   They'll think that your joy over the beauty of a starlit sky and your sorrow over the
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.680]   loss of life in a natural disaster, they'll think these are simply the same sort of feelings
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.620]   they have from time to time.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:17.640]   They can't see how these feelings are spiritually new, how they are profoundly of a different
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.320]   nature than theirs because of their connection with Christ, their connection with salvation,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.540]   their connection with eternity, their connection with holiness, their rootedness in the Holy
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.760]   Spirit.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.520]   They have no categories for grasping what you feel.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.160]   The emotional life of the new creation in Christ is of a different order than what the
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.260]   world experiences.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:56.880]   So let me say a word, Amanda, about your particular challenge of feeling almost paralyzed by the
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.260]   physical oppression of the burdens of these sorrows that other people's sufferings are
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.160]   causing you.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.300]   Seems to me from the Bible that two things are crucial.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:20.200]   One is that your new sensitivity is a good and necessary part of what it means to be
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.720]   a new creation in Christ.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.680]   1 Peter 3:8 says we are to have a tender heart that feels sympathy with others.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.080]   Romans 12, 15, weep with those who weep.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.040]   Romans 9, 3, Paul feels unceasing anguish in his heart for his perishing relatives.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.760]   Galatians 6, 2, we are to bear one another's burdens.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:57.920]   So yes, Christians are to take on the suffering of others in a way that we never did when
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.960]   we were not Christians.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.520]   We are to take them for the sake of helping others, not just sinking with them.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.840]   Love does not just go down with others.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:20.400]   It's willing to, but it wants to feel with others so that we can help them survive and
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.720]   flourish, which leads now to the second crucial thing we have to consider, namely, mature
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:37.280]   growth in grace means that interdependent graces must grow together.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.520]   Now, I know that's probably too vague for anybody to grasp.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.360]   Let me say it again and then explain it with an analogy.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:54.080]   Mature Christian growth, which is what I think is needed in Amanda here, mature growth means
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:02.040]   that interdependent graces must grow together.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   So explanation.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:11.960]   One of the problems with growing tomatoes is that the tomatoes are, at least in my experience,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:21.080]   I'm a lousy tomato grower, they're often too heavy for the branches to support, and so
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.520]   they bend down and lie on the ground and rot.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.900]   Now it seems to me that's what Amanda is experiencing.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:40.640]   The wonderful tomato of empathy, beautiful, red, juicy tomato of empathy has grown in
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   Amanda's life faster than the stalk and the branch of doctrinally informed faith to support
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:59.280]   it, faith that can sustain the weight of being bent down to the ground so that nothing rots
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.560]   in the Christian life, and that big, beautiful tomato of empathy, therefore, in Amanda's
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.960]   life is threatening to lie on the ground and be ruined.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.320]   That's what she's documenting.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:19.100]   I'm being ruined by this paralysis of empathy.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:27.880]   So my simple counsel, Amanda, is that you set your heart and your mind to pursue the
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   kind of growth and strength that would enable you to support by faith what God is doing
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.120]   in your heart.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:49.320]   You need the strong fiber of God's wisdom and sovereignty and goodness in the root and
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:57.480]   the stalk and the branches of your life so that you have the firmness to hold up the
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.200]   emotions that you feel and they don't crush you.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   And here's what I have in mind.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:11.920]   2 Peter 3.18 says, "Grow in the knowledge and the grace of our Lord Jesus."
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.800]   So both knowledge and grace, they need to grow together.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.200]   They are interdependent, and they need to grow together.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.760]   Spiritual knowledge and experiential grace need to grow together.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:40.400]   So Amanda, be glad, be glad that your heart is graciously tender and seek to add the tough
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:48.720]   fiber of doctrinal knowledge and truth to the branches of your life.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.360]   God does not mean for you to be paralyzed by your empathy or your sympathy or your intense
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.840]   feelings of affection or love.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:04.680]   He means for it to produce the action of love, not the inactivity of oppression.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.280]   This is what the revelation of His fullness is for in the Bible.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.280]   So He will do it.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.280]   Yeah, that's really good.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.760]   That's a great question to stabilize us to face the emotional stresses of this life.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.920]   And Amanda, thanks for the excellent question.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.640]   And thank you for listening and supporting this podcast.

[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.160]   got a steak and a twisty type problem to me.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:52.600]   You can do all those things through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.360]   Well how do we avoid overthinking the Christian life?
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.520]   It's a relevant question for a podcast like this.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.840]   It spends a lot of time thinking about the Christian life.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.560]   But we can also underthink the Christian life too.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.000]   So how do we avoid both ditches of overthinking or underthinking the Christian life?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.600]   That's the question we close the week out with on Friday.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.120]   We'll see you next time.
