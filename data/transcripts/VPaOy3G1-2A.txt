[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   The following is a conversation with Lisa Rundell,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.360]   a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Harvard.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.880]   Her work involves improving our understanding
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.120]   of particle physics, supersymmetry,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.600]   baryogenesis, cosmological inflation, and dark matter.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.480]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.460]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.680]   in the description.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.980]   And now, dear friends, here's Lisa Rundell.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.580]   One of the things you work on and write about
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.000]   is dark matter.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.540]   We can't see it, but there's a lot of it in the universe.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.860]   You also end one of your books with a Beatles song quote,
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.520]   "Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see."
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.000]   (Lisa laughs)
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.600]   What is dark matter?
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200]   How should we think about it, given that we can't see it?
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.880]   How should we visualize it in our mind's eye?
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.440]   - I think one of the really important things
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.520]   that physics teaches you is just our limitations,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.440]   but also our abilities.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.360]   So the fact that we can deduce the existence
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720]   of something that we don't directly see
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.160]   is really a tribute to people, that we can do that.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.360]   But it's also something that tells you
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.160]   you can't overly rely on your direct senses.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.540]   If you just relied on just what you see directly,
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.460]   you would miss so much of what's happening in the world.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.060]   And we can generalize this, but just for now,
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.520]   to focus on dark matter, it's something we know is there.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.960]   And it's not just one way we know it's there.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.640]   In my book, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.800]   I talk about the many different ways,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.280]   you know, there's eight or nine,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.560]   that we deduce not just the existence of dark matter,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.440]   but how much is there, and they all agree.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.880]   Now, how do we know it's there?
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.560]   Because of its gravitational force.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.280]   And individually, a particle doesn't have
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.480]   such a big gravitational force.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.240]   In fact, gravity is an extremely weak force
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.800]   compared to other forces we know about in nature.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.600]   But there's a lot of dark matter out there.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.720]   It carries a lot of energy,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.360]   five times the amount of energy as the matter we know
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.440]   that's in atoms, et cetera.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.640]   So, you can ask how should we think about it?
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.860]   Well, it's just another form of matter
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.680]   that doesn't interact with light,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.520]   or at least as far as we know.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.000]   So it interacts gravitationally, it clumps,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.600]   it forms galaxies, but it doesn't interact with light,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.800]   which means we just don't see it.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.420]   And most of our detection,
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.800]   before gravitational wave detectors,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.160]   we only saw things because of their interactions
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.560]   with light in some sense.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.840]   - So in theory, it behaves just like any other matter,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.440]   it just doesn't interact with light.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.640]   - So when we say it interacts just like
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.040]   any other form of matter, we have to be careful.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920]   Because gravitationally, it interacts
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.520]   like other forms of matter.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.400]   But it doesn't experience electromagnetism,
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.040]   which is why it has a different distribution.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.000]   So in our galaxy, it's roughly spherical,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.800]   unless it has its own interactions, that's another story.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.920]   But we know that it's roughly spherical.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   Whereas ordinary matter can radiate and clumps into a disk.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.600]   And that's why we see the Milky Way disk.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.280]   So on large scales, in some sense,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.840]   yes, all the matter is similar in some sense.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.340]   In fact, dark matter is in some sense more important,
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.340]   because it can collapse more readily than ordinary matter,
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.120]   because ordinary matter has radiative forces,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.700]   which makes it hard to collapse on small scales.
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.200]   So actually, it's dark matter that sort of drives
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.000]   galaxy formation, and then ordinary matter
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.080]   kind of comes along with it.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.440]   And there's also just more of it.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.400]   And because there's more of it,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.320]   it can start collapsing sooner.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.000]   That is to say, the energy density in dark matter
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.800]   dominates over radiation earlier
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.240]   than you would if you just had ordinary matter.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.520]   - So it's part of the story of the origin of a galaxy,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.200]   part of the story of the end of the galaxy,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.040]   and part of the story of all the various interactions.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.660]   - Exactly, I mean, in my book,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.980]   I make kind of sort of jokes about,
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.100]   you know, it's like when we think about a building,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.260]   we think about the architect,
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.980]   we think about the high level,
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.280]   but we forget about all the workers
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.740]   that did all the grunt work.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.900]   And in fact, dark matter was really important
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.180]   in the formation of our universe,
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.620]   and we forget that sometimes.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.920]   - That's a metaphor, on top of a metaphor.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.660]   Okay. (Bridget laughing)
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.680]   The unheard voices that do the actual work.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.520]   Okay. - Exactly.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.900]   No, but it is a metaphor, but it also captures something,
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.660]   because the fact is, we don't directly see it,
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.460]   so we forget it's there,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.220]   or we don't understand it's there, or we think it's not.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.300]   The fact that we don't see it makes it no less legitimate.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.740]   It just means that we have challenges
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.340]   in order to find out exactly what it is.
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.960]   - Yeah, but the things we cannot see
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.340]   that nevertheless have gravitational interaction
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.100]   with the things we can see is,
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.940]   at the layman level,
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.620]   it's just mind-blowing.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.980]   - It is, and it isn't,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.300]   because I think what it's teaching us is that we're human.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.060]   The universe is what it is,
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.420]   and we're trying to interact with that universe
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.460]   and discover what it is.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.780]   We've discovered amazing things.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.580]   In fact, I would say it's more surprising
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.700]   that the matter that we know about
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.580]   constitutes as big a fraction of the universe as it does.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.700]   I mean, we're limited, we're human.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.340]   And the fact that we see 5% of the energy density
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.180]   of the universe,
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.540]   about 1/6 of the energy density of matter,
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.780]   that's kind of remarkable.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.060]   I mean, why should that be?
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.540]   There could be anything, anything could be out there,
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.900]   yet the universe that we see is a significant fraction.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.220]   - Yeah, but a lot of our intuition, I think,
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.140]   operates using visualizations in the mind.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.460]   - That's absolutely true,
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.860]   and it's certainly writing books I realized.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.620]   Also, how many of our words are based
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.940]   on how we see the world.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.660]   And that's true, and that's actually
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.500]   one of the fantastic things about physics
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.000]   is that it teaches you how to go beyond
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.840]   your immediate intuition to develop intuitions
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.560]   that apply at different distances, different scales,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.980]   different ways of thinking about things.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.380]   - Yeah, how do you anthropomorphize dark matter?
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.720]   - I just did, I think.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.400]   I made it the grant workers.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   - Oh yeah, that's good.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.840]   Yeah, you did.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.640]   That's why you get paid the big bucks
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.000]   with the big bucks, and write the great books.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.280]   Okay, so you also write in that book
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.240]   about dark matter having to do something
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.920]   with the extinction events, the extinction of the dinosaurs,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.680]   which is kind of a fascinating presentation
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.340]   of how everything is connected.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.340]   So I guess the disturbances from the dark matter,
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.040]   they create gravitational disturbances in the Oort cloud
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.800]   at the edge of our solar system,
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.640]   and then that increases the rate of asteroids
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.840]   hitting Earth.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   - So I want to be really clear.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.520]   This was a speculative theory.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.480]   - Love it, though.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   - I mean, and I liked it, too,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.680]   and we still don't know for sure,
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.720]   but we can, what we liked about it,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.440]   so let me take a step back.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.320]   So we usually assume that dark matter,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.840]   we being physicists, that it's just one thing.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.360]   It's just basically non-interacting,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.520]   aside from gravity, or very weakly interacting matter.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.480]   But again, we have to get outside the mindset
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.400]   of just humans and ask, what else could be there?
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.900]   And so what we suggested is that there's a fraction
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.040]   of dark matter, not all the dark matter,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.080]   but some of the dark matter,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.520]   maybe it has interactions of its own.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.760]   Just the same way in our universe,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.720]   we have lots of different types of matter.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.920]   We have nuclei, we have electrons, we have forces.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   It's not a simple model, the standard model,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.400]   but it does have some basic ingredients.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.960]   So maybe dark matter also has
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.680]   some interesting structure to it.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.840]   So maybe there's some small fraction.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.320]   And the interesting thing is that
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.960]   if some of the dark matter does radiate,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.120]   and I like to call it dark light,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.040]   because it's light that we don't see,
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.440]   but dark matter would see, it could radiate that,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.840]   and then it could perhaps collapse into a disk
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.600]   the same way ordinary matter collapsed
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.120]   into the Milky Way disk.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.840]   So it's not all the dark matter, it's a fraction.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.480]   But it could conceivably be a very thin disk of dark matter,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.960]   thin, dense disk of dark matter.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.800]   And so then the question is, do these exist?
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.080]   And people have done studies now
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.560]   to think about whether they can find them.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.840]   I mean, it's an interesting target,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.300]   it's something you can measure.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.720]   By measuring the positions and velocities of stars,
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.440]   you can find out what the structure of the Milky Way is.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.800]   But the fun proposal was that
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.440]   the solar system orbits around the galaxy.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.200]   And as it does so, it goes a little bit up and down,
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.280]   kind of like horses on a carousel.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.080]   And the suggestion was every time it goes through,
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.600]   you have an enhanced probability
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   that you would dislodge something
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.280]   from the edge of the solar system,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.040]   in something called the Oort Cloud.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.800]   So the idea was that at those times,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   you're more likely to have these cataclysmic events,
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.000]   such as the amazing one that actually caused
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.680]   the last extinction that we know of, for sure.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.240]   - It wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.440]   - Or for 2/3 of the species on the planet.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.760]   - Yeah, but it's amazing for humans, it wouldn't be--
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.160]   - What really is amazing, I mean, I talk about this
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.280]   in "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs."
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.800]   It's just an amazing scientific story,
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.120]   because it really is one of the real stories
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.720]   that combine together different fields of science.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.760]   Geologists at the time, or, you know,
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.520]   people thought that things happened slowly,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.440]   and this would be a cataclysmic event.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.080]   And also, I have to say, if you think about it,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.440]   it sounds like a story like a five-year-old would make up.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.760]   Maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some big rock
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.720]   that came and hit the Earth,
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.400]   but then there really was a scientific story behind it.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.840]   And that's also why I like the dark disc,
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.720]   'cause there's a scientific story behind it.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.840]   So as far-fetched as it might sound,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.400]   you could actually go and look for
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.840]   the experimental consequences,
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.320]   or the observational consequences,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.000]   to test whether it's true.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.420]   - I wish you could know high-resolution details
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.880]   of where that asteroid came from,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.400]   like where in the Oort cloud, why it happened,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.120]   is it in fact because of dark matter?
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.440]   Just like the full tracing back
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.640]   to the origin of the universe.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.080]   Humans seem to be somewhat special,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.680]   but it just, it seems like so many fascinating events
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.080]   at all scales of physics had to happen for--
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.080]   - So I'm really, really glad you mentioned that,
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.520]   because actually, that was one of the main points
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.340]   of my book, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.920]   One of the reasons I wrote it was because
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.760]   I really think we are abusing the planet,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.920]   we're changing the planet way too quickly.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.880]   And just like anything else, when you alter things,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.200]   it's good to think about the history
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.920]   of what it took to get here.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.700]   And as you point out, it took many operations
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.480]   on many different scales.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.800]   We had to have the formation of structure,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.080]   the formation of galaxies,
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.440]   the formation of the solar system,
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.640]   the formation of our planet, the formation of humans.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.280]   I mean, there's so many steps that go into this.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.560]   And humans, in some part, were the result
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.680]   of the fact that this big object hit the Earth,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.320]   made the dinosaurs go extinct, and mammals developed.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.200]   I mean, it is an incredible story.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.520]   And yes, something else might come of it,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   but it won't be us if we mess with it too much.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.840]   - But it is, on a grand scale,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.940]   Earth is a pretty resilient system.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.520]   Can you just clarify, it's just fascinating,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.280]   the shape of things.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.440]   So the shape of the Milky Way,
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.640]   of the observable stuff is mostly flat.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.840]   And you said dark matter tends to be spherical,
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.560]   but a subset of that might be a flat disk.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.440]   - So you wanted to hear about the shape of things.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.520]   - Yes, please.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.840]   - So structure formed early on,
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.040]   and now our structure that we live in,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.360]   so we know about the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.760]   So the Milky Way galaxy has the disk you can see
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.960]   in a dry, dark place.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   That's where stars and light is.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   But you can also measure, in some ways, the dark matter.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.560]   And we believe that dark matter
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   is more or less spherically distributed.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.280]   And like we said, there's a lot of it.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.720]   Not necessarily in the disk,
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.160]   but just because it's a sphere,
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.200]   there's a lot of it sitting there.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.120]   And the reason it doesn't collapse, as far as we know,
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.960]   is that it can't radiate the same way.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.400]   So because it can radiate, ordinary matter collapses.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.880]   And it's actually because
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.920]   of conservation of angular momentum.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.440]   It stays a disk, and it doesn't just collapse to the center.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.160]   So our suggestion was that maybe there are some components
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.780]   of dark matter that also radiate.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.360]   Like I said, that's far from proven.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.480]   People have looked for a disk.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.880]   They see some evidence of some disks of certain densities.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.580]   But these are all questions that are worth asking.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.400]   Basically, if we can figure it out
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.680]   from existing measurements, why not try?
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.960]   - Okay, so there's not all dark matter is made the same.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.720]   - Well, that's a possibility.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.960]   We actually don't know what dark matter is
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.800]   in the first place.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.840]   We don't know what most of it is.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.200]   We don't know what a fraction is.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.480]   I mean, it's hard to measure.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.400]   Why is it hard to measure?
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.580]   For exactly the reason you said earlier, we don't see it.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.680]   So we wanna think of possibilities for what it can be,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.400]   especially if those give rise
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.760]   to some observational consequences.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.120]   I mean, it's a tough game,
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.780]   because it's not something that's just there for the taking.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.040]   You have to think about what it could be
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.240]   and how you might find it.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.680]   - And the way you detect it is gravitational effects
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.000]   on things we can see.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.280]   - That would be the way you detect the type of dark matter
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.520]   I've been talking about.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.600]   People have suggestions for other forms of dark matter.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.440]   They could be particles called axions.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.360]   They could be other types of particles.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.920]   And then there are different ways of detecting it.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.960]   I mean, the most popular candidate for dark matter,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.800]   probably until pretty recently, because they haven't found it,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.880]   is something called WIMPs,
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.380]   weakly interacting massive particles,
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.320]   particles that have mass about the same
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.720]   as the Higgs boson mass.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.120]   And it turns out then you would get
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.320]   about the right density of dark matter.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.560]   But then people really like that, of course,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.440]   because it is connected to the standard model,
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   the particles that we know about.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.920]   And if it's connected to that,
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.040]   we have a better chance of actually seeing it.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   Fortunately or unfortunately,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.680]   it's also a better chance that you can rule it out,
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.920]   because you can look for it.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.200]   And so far, no one has found it.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.240]   We're still looking for it.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.840]   - Is that one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider?
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.320]   - That was originally one of the hopes
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.800]   of the Large Hadron Collider.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.120]   I'd say at this point, it would be very unlikely,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.200]   given what they've already accomplished.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.520]   But there are these underground detectors,
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.160]   xenon detectors that look for dark matter coming in.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   And they are going to try to achieve
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.080]   a much stronger bound than exists today.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.040]   - Just to take that tangent, looking back now,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   what's the biggest, to you, insight to humanity
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.640]   that the LHC has been able to provide?
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.480]   - It's interesting.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.840]   It's both a major victory.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.120]   The Higgs boson was proposed 50 years ago,
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.640]   and it was discovered.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.700]   The Higgs mechanism seemed to be the only way
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.760]   to explain elementary particle masses, and it was right.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.000]   So on the one hand, it was a major victory.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.760]   On the other hand, I've been in physics long enough
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.920]   to know it was also a cautionary tale in some sense,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.120]   because at the time I started out in physics,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.920]   we had proposed something in the United States
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.640]   called the superconducting supercollider.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.360]   A lot of physicists, I'll say particularly in Europe,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.240]   but I'd say a lot of physicists,
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.760]   were saying when that the Large Hadron Collider
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.300]   would have the energy reach necessary
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.520]   to discover what underlies the standard model.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.000]   We don't want to just discover the standard model,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.920]   we want to know what the next step is.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.200]   And I think here, people were more cautious about that.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.600]   They wanted to have a more comprehensive search
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.280]   that could get to higher energies, more events,
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.040]   so that we could really more definitively rule it out.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.000]   But in that case, many people thought
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.960]   they knew what would be there.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.120]   It happened to be a theory called supersymmetry,
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.080]   so a lot of physicists thought it would be supersymmetry.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.980]   I mean, it's one of the many factors, I think,
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.400]   that went into the fact that the Large Hadron Collider
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.280]   became the only machine in town.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.080]   And the superconducting supercollider,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.160]   would have just been a much,
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.580]   if it really had achieved what it was supposed to,
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.000]   would have been a much more robust test of the space.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.800]   So I'd say for humanity, it's both a tribute
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.560]   to the ability of discovery
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.800]   and the ability of really believing in things,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.880]   so that you have the confidence to go look for them.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.000]   But it's also a cautionary tale that you don't want to,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.900]   you know, assume things before they've been actually found.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.000]   So you want to do things,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.660]   and you want to believe in your theories,
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.840]   but you also want to question them at the same time,
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.480]   in ways that you're more likely to discover the truth.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.240]   - But it's also an illustration of grand engineering efforts
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.280]   that humanity can take on,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.900]   and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.840]   - I'm really glad you said that, though, too,
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   because that's absolutely true.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.840]   I mean, it really is an impressive,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.640]   it's impressive in so many ways.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.240]   It's impressive technologically,
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.120]   it's impressive at an engineering level.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.160]   It's also impressive that so many countries work together
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.980]   to do this, it wasn't just one country.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.540]   And how it was, it was also impressive in that
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.280]   it was a long-term project that people committed to
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.320]   and made it happen.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.840]   So it is a demonstration that when people
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.200]   set their minds to things and they commit to it,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.080]   that they can do something amazing.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.400]   - But also, in the United States,
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.880]   maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things down.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.160]   - Bureaucracy and politics. - Politics.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.840]   - And economics, many, many things can make them faster
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.240]   and make them slower.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.420]   So science is the way to make progress,
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.240]   politics is the way to slow that progress down.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.560]   And here we-- - Well, I don't wanna
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   overstate that because without politics,
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.900]   the LHC wouldn't happen either. - No, we need it.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.080]   - But-- - You need broccoli.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.040]   - But sometimes I do think, I mean,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.260]   you're not asking this question,
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.640]   but sometimes I do think when I think about
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.520]   some of these conflicts, sometimes it's just good
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   to have a project that people work on together.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.800]   And there were some efforts to do that in science too,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.760]   to have Palestinians and Israelis work together,
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.080]   project called Sesame.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.320]   I think it's not a bad idea when you can do that,
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   when you can get, you know, sort of forget the politics
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.760]   and just focus on some particular project,
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.200]   sometimes that can work.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.440]   - Some kind of forcing function, some kind of deadline
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.280]   that gets people to sit in a room together,
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.640]   and you're working on a thing, but as part of that,
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.720]   you realize the common humanity,
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.200]   that you all have the same concerns, the same hopes,
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.040]   the same fears, the same, that you are all human.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.080]   And that's an accidental side effect
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.400]   of working together on a thing.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.000]   - That's absolutely true, and it's one of the reasons
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.560]   CERN was formed, actually.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.800]   It was post-World War II, and a lot of European physicists
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.480]   had actually left Europe, and they wanted to see
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.560]   Europeans work together and sort of rebuild.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.680]   And it worked, I mean, they did.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.800]   And it's true, I often think that one of the major problems
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.880]   is we just don't meet enough people,
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.560]   so that everyone thinks, when they seem like the other,
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.200]   it's more easy to forget their humanity.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.040]   So I think it is important to have these connections.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.120]   - Given the complexity, all cosmological scales involved here
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.760]   that led to the extension of the dinosaurs,
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.800]   when you look out at the future of Earth,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   do you worry about future extinction events?
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.760]   - I do think that we might be in the middle
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.360]   of an extinction right now, if you define it
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.160]   by the number of species that are getting killed off.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.880]   And it's subtle, but it's a complex system.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.800]   The way things respond to events is sometimes things evolve,
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.460]   sometimes animals just move to another place.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.600]   And the way we've developed the Earth,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.400]   it's very hard for species just to move somewhere else.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.520]   And we're seeing that with people now too.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.360]   I mean, I know people are worried just about AI taking over,
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.400]   and that's a totally different story.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.720]   We just don't think about the future very much,
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.160]   we think about what we're doing now.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   And we certainly don't think enough about all the animals
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.720]   that we're destroying, all the things that are precursors
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.460]   to humans that we sort of rely on.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.680]   - It's interesting to think whether the things
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.920]   that threaten us is the stuff we see
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.120]   that's happening gradually, or the stuff we don't really see
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.040]   that's gonna happen all of a sudden.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   I sometimes think about what should we be more worried about?
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.280]   'Cause it seems like with asteroids or nuclear war,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.360]   it could be stuff that just happens one day.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.520]   When I say one day, meaning over a span
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.920]   of a few days or a few months,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.100]   but not on a scale of decades and centuries.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.880]   'Cause we sometimes mostly talk about stuff
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.640]   that's happening gradually.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.840]   But you can be really surprised.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.720]   - It's actually really interesting,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.680]   and that was actually one of the reasons
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.320]   it took a while to determine what it was
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.600]   that had caused the last extinction.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.120]   Because people did think at the time,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.420]   many people thought that things were more gradual.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.640]   And the idea of extinction was actually a novel concept
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.280]   at some point.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.040]   I mean, these aren't predictable events necessarily,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.800]   they're only predictable on a grand scale.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.760]   But sometimes they are.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.760]   And I think people were pretty aware
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.480]   that nuclear weapons were dangerous.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.560]   I'm not sure people are as aware now
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.520]   as they were say 20 or 30 years ago.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.320]   And that certainly worries me.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.120]   I have to say I was not as worried about AI as other people,
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.760]   but now I understand.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.660]   And it's not, I mean, it's more that
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.360]   as soon as you create things that we lose control over,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.200]   it's scary.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.960]   And the other thing that we're learning
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.560]   from the events today is that it takes a few bad actors.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.180]   It takes everyone to sort of make things work well.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.800]   It takes not that many things to make things go wrong.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.600]   It's the issue with disease.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.760]   We can find out what causes a disease,
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.800]   but to make things better is not necessarily that simple.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.220]   Sometimes it is.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.640]   But for things to be healthy, a lot of things have to work.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.840]   For things to go wrong, only one thing has to go wrong.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.320]   And so it's amazing that we do it.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.800]   And the same is true for democracy.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.760]   For democracy to work,
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.440]   a lot of people have to believe in it.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.000]   A few bad actors can destroy things sometimes.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.760]   So a lot of the things that we really rely on
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.560]   are delicate equilibrium situations.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.400]   And there is some robustness in the systems.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.440]   We try to build in robustness,
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   but a few extreme events can sometimes alter things.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.800]   And I think that's what people are scared of today
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.640]   in many ways.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.760]   They're scared of it for democracy.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.320]   They're scared of it for peace.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.000]   They're scared of it for AI.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.720]   I think they're not as scared as they should be
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.320]   about nuclear weapons, to be honest.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.120]   I think that's a more serious danger than people realize.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.000]   I think people are a little bit more scared about pandemics
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.640]   than they were before,
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.400]   but I still say they're not super scared about it.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.340]   So you're right.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.800]   There are these major events that can happen,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.320]   and we are setting things up so that they might happen.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.200]   And we should be thinking about them.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   The question is, who should be thinking about them?
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.400]   How should we be thinking about them?
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.800]   How do you make things happen on a global scale?
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.400]   'Cause that's really what we need.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.360]   - It certainly shouldn't be a source of division.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.160]   It should be a source of grand collaboration, probably.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.560]   - Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.400]   - Yeah.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.440]   I just wonder what it'd be like to be a dinosaur.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.440]   It must have been beautiful to look at the asteroid
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520]   just enter the atmosphere.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.840]   Until everything just, man, would I...
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.100]   That'd be one of the things I would travel back in time to.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.320]   It's just to watch it. - That's also one
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.640]   of the things that I think you probably could do
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.680]   with virtual reality.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.440]   I don't think you have to be there and get extinct.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.680]   - To just experience it.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.240]   - I think there's something, it's an event,
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.760]   you're just watching, you're not doing anything,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.080]   you're just looking at it.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.720]   So maybe you could just recreate it.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.280]   - I actually heard that there's a nuclear weapon
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.920]   explosion experience in virtual reality
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   that's good to remind you about what it would feel like.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.480]   I have to say, I got an award from the Museum of Nuclear
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.440]   History and Technology in the Southwest,
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.200]   and I went to visit the museum,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.120]   which turned out to be mostly a museum of nuclear weapons.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   And the scary thing is that they look really cool.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.920]   It's true that you have that, yes, this is scary,
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.160]   but you also have this, this is cool feeling.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.360]   And I think we have to get around that
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.840]   because I kind of think that, yes, you can be in that,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.000]   but I'm not sure that's going to make people scared.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Have they actually asked afterwards,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   are you more or less scared?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.680]   - That's a good, it's a really good point.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.760]   I mean, that's a good summary of just humanity in general.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.460]   We're attracted to creating cool stuff,
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.120]   even though it can be dangerous.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.960]   - And actually, that was the really interesting thing
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.440]   about visiting that museum, actually.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.120]   It was very nice 'cause I had a tour from people
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.040]   who had been working there in the Cold War,
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.520]   and actually one or two people from the Manhattan Project.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.320]   It was a very cool tour.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.680]   And you just realize just how,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.880]   just the thing itself gets you so excited.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.080]   I think that's something that sometimes these movies miss,
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.160]   just the thing itself.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.600]   You're not thinking about the overall consequences.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.920]   And it was kind of like, in some ways,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.040]   it was like the early Silicon Valley.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.740]   People were just thinking, what if we did this?
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.240]   What if we did that?
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.000]   And not keeping track of what the peripheral consequences are.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.580]   And you definitely see that happening with AI now.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.520]   I mean, I think that was the moral of the battle
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.160]   that just happened, that it's just full speed ahead.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.480]   - Which gives me a really great transition
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.000]   to another quote in your book.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.760]   So you write about the experience
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.600]   of facing the sublime in physics.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.080]   And you quote Ryan Aroque,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.920]   quote, "For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror,
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.560]   "which we are still just able to endure,
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.120]   "and we're so awed because it serenely disdains
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.920]   "to annihilate us."
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.560]   That's pretty intense.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.880]   I think applies to nuclear weapons.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.600]   - But it also, I mean, at a more mundane, perhaps, level,
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.360]   I think it applies, it's really interesting.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.000]   One of the things I found when I wrote these books
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.960]   is some people love certainty.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.240]   Scientists, many revel in uncertainty.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.080]   It's not that you wanna be uncertain, you wanna solve it.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.280]   But you're at this edge where it's really frustrating,
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.680]   because you don't really wanna not know the answer.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.240]   But of course, if you knew the answer,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.320]   that would be, it would be done.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.960]   So you're always at this edge
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.640]   where you're trying to sort things out.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.080]   And there is something scary.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   You don't know what is,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.160]   you don't know if there's gonna be a solution.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.720]   You don't know if you're going to find it.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.280]   So it's not something that can destroy the Earth.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.520]   It's just something that you do on your individual level.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.600]   But then, of course, there are much bigger things,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.200]   like the ones you're talking about,
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.000]   where they could actually be dangerous.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.680]   The stuff I do, I just wanna be clear,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.800]   I'm doing theoretical physics, not very dangerous.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.160]   But sometimes things end up having
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.240]   bigger consequences than you think.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   - Yeah, but dangerous in a very pragmatic sense.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.720]   But isn't it still, in part, terrifying
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.400]   when you think of just the size of things?
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.920]   Like the size of dark matter,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.440]   like the power of this thing,
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.280]   in terms of its potential gravitational effects.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.560]   Just this cosmological objects,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.360]   a black hole at the center of our galaxy.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.120]   - So this might be why I'm a physicist,
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.720]   or why I differ from other people.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.480]   Because I'm not such a big fan of humanity in some ways.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.520]   Some ways I am.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.880]   But the idea that we were everything
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.480]   would be really boring to me.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.680]   I love the idea that there's so much more out there,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.880]   that there's a bigger universe,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.280]   and there's lots to discover,
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.400]   and that we're not all there is.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.840]   Wouldn't it be disappointing if we were all there is?
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.720]   - Yeah, and the full diversity of other stuff.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.160]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.960]   - We have no idea how much there is.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.360]   We know what we can observe so far.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.440]   So the idea that there's other stuff out there
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.440]   that we yet have to figure out, it's exciting.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.120]   - Well, let me ask you an out there question.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.960]   - Uh-oh.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.120]   - Okay.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.800]   So if you think of humans on Earth, life on Earth,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.640]   as this pocket of complexity that emerged.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.680]   And there's a bunch of conditions that came to be,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.960]   and there's Darwinian evolution,
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.760]   however life originated.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.360]   Do you think it's possible there's some pockets
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.000]   of complexity of that sort inside dark matter?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.840]   Who can see?
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.720]   - So that's possible.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.560]   - Chemistry and biology evolving in different ways.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.440]   - And that's one of the reasons we suggest,
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   I mean, it's not the reason,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.280]   but it would be true if there were
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.880]   the type of interactions we'd suggest.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.200]   I mean, it would need more complex ones.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.400]   And we don't know.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.080]   I will say that the conditions that give rise
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.200]   to life and complexity, they're complex, they're unlikely.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.000]   So it's not like there's great odds that would happen.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.240]   But there's no reason to know that it doesn't happen.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.800]   It's worth investigating.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.360]   Are there other forces that exist
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.560]   in the dark matter sector?
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.400]   That's exactly it.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.360]   - So the dark matter sector doesn't have
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.080]   all the forces of the standard model of physics?
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.960]   - Right, as far as we know, it doesn't have any.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.920]   It might have it at some low level.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.240]   But it could have its own forces,
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.720]   just like the dark matter might not experience our light,
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.200]   maybe it has its light that we don't experience.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   - So there could be other kinds of forces.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.280]   - I mean, there could be other kinds of forces
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.680]   even within our sector that are too weak
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.840]   for us to have discovered so far,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.660]   or that exist at different scales than we know about.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.420]   I mean, we detect what interacts strongly enough
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.500]   with our detectors to detect.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.260]   So it's worth asking.
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.740]   And that's one of the reasons we build big colliders
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.180]   to see are there other forces, other particles
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.340]   that exist, say, at higher energies,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.740]   at shorter distance scales than we've explored so far.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.820]   So it's not just in the dark matter sector.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.740]   Even in our sector, there could be a whole bunch of stuff
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.700]   we don't yet know.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.140]   - So maybe let's zoom out and look at the standard model
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.740]   of particle physics.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.300]   How does dark matter fit into, first of all, what is it?
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.780]   Can you explain what the standard model is?
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.060]   - So the standard model of particle physics
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:35.700]   is basically tells us about nature's most basic elements
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.380]   and their interactions.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.180]   And so it's the substructure as far as we understand it.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.220]   So if you look at atoms,
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.800]   we know they have nuclei and electrons.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.900]   Nuclei have protons and neutrons in them.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.080]   Protons and neutrons have particles called quarks
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.220]   that are held together by something called the strong force.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.860]   They interact through the strong force,
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.300]   the strong nuclear force,
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.780]   something called the weak nuclear force
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.760]   and electromagnetism.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.460]   So basically all those particles and their interactions
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.820]   describe many, many things we understand.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.720]   That's the standard model.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.220]   We now know about the Higgs boson,
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.620]   which is associated with how elementary particles
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.460]   get their mass.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.620]   So that piece of the puzzle has also been completed.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.860]   We also know that there are kind of a weird array of masses
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.460]   of elementary particles.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.460]   There's not just the up and down quark,
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.340]   but there are heavier versions of the up and down quark,
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.420]   charm and strange, top and bottom.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.340]   There's not just the electron, there's a muon and a tau.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.960]   There are particles called neutrinos,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.020]   which are under intense study now,
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.660]   which are partnered with the leptons
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.420]   through the weak interactions.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.660]   So we really do know these basic elements
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.700]   and we know the forces.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.220]   We know, I mean,
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.040]   when we're doing particle physics experiments,
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.140]   we can usually even ignore gravity,
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.420]   except in exceptional cases that we can talk about.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.780]   So those are the basic elements in their interactions.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.680]   Dark matter stands outside that.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.580]   It's not interacting through those forces.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.580]   So when we look at the world around us,
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.800]   we don't usually see the effects of dark matter.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.540]   It's because there's so much of it that we do
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.860]   and it doesn't have those forces that we know about.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.500]   But the Standard Model has worked spectacularly well.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.460]   It's been tested to a high degree of precision.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.140]   People are still testing it.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.820]   And one of the things we do as physicists
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.060]   is we actually wanted to break down at some level.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.300]   We're looking for the precision measurement
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.500]   or the energy or whatever it will take,
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.580]   where the Standard Model is no longer working.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.100]   Not that it's not working approximately,
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.500]   but we're looking for the deviations.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   And those deviations are critical
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.060]   because they can tell us what underlies the Standard Model,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.940]   which is what we really wanna see next.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.500]   - Where can you find the places
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.060]   where the Standard Model breaks down?
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.300]   Like what are the places you can see
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.940]   those tiny little deviations?
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.580]   - So we don't know yet,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.220]   but we know the kinds of things you wouldn't wanna look for.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.020]   So one obvious place to look is at higher energy.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.620]   We're looking at the Large Hadron Collider,
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.460]   but we'd love to go beyond that.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.060]   Higher energies means shorter distances
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.440]   and it means things that we just couldn't produce before.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.460]   I mean, E equals MC squared.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.580]   So if you have a heavy particle
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.100]   and you don't have enough energy to make it,
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.540]   you'll never see it.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.940]   So that's one place.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.940]   The other place is precision measurements.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.860]   If you, you know,
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.580]   the Standard Model has been tested exquisitely.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.900]   So if it's been tested at 1%,
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.180]   you wanna look at a 10th of a percent.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.300]   And there are some processes
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.820]   that we know shouldn't even happen at all
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.620]   in the Standard Model or happen at a very suppressed level.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.940]   And those are other things that we look for.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.860]   So all of those things could indicate
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.720]   there's something beyond what we know about,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.480]   which of course would be very exciting.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.720]   - When you just step back and look at the Standard Model,
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.000]   the quarks and all the different particles and neutrinos,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.680]   isn't it wild how this like little system came to being,
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.100]   creates, underpins everything we see?
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.940]   - Absolutely.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.920]   And that's why we'd like to understand it better.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.320]   We wanna know, is it part of some bigger sector?
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.280]   Why are these particles,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.720]   why do they have the masses they do?
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.660]   - Yeah.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:09.980]   - Why is the Higgs boson so light
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.660]   compared to the mass it could have had,
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.460]   which we might have even expected
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.540]   based on the principles of special relativity
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.740]   and quantum mechanics?
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   So that's a really big question.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.220]   Why are they what they are?
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.460]   - And they originate, there's like some mechanism
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.940]   that created the whole thing?
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.820]   - That's one of the things we're trying to study.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.540]   Why is it what it is?
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.380]   - I mean, even just like the mechanism that creates stuff,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.380]   like the way a human being is created from a single cell.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.840]   It's like embryogenesis,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.240]   like the whole thing, you build up this thing.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.880]   All of it, this whole thing comes to be
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.720]   from just like a tiny little--
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   - But don't forget, it is interacting with the environment.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.620]   - Sure.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.460]   Okay, right, right, right.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.960]   It's not, it's not, right.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.800]   - It's important.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   - Well, that's a really good question,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.440]   is how much of it is the environment?
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.080]   Is it just the environment acting on a set of constraints?
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.880]   And like how much of it is just the information in the DNA
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.160]   or in the information?
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.000]   How much is it in the initial conditions of the universe
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.760]   versus some other thing acting on it?
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.920]   - These are big questions.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.480]   These are big questions in pretty much every field.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.800]   For the universe, we do consider it,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.300]   it's everything there is by definition.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.360]   But people now think about it as one of many universes.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.620]   And of course, it's a misnomer,
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.080]   but could there be other places
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.340]   where there are self-contained gravitational systems
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.520]   that we don't even interact with?
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.060]   So, but those are really important questions.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.600]   And the only way we're gonna answer them is,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.560]   you know, we go back as far as we can.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.060]   We try to think theoretically,
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.000]   and we try to think about observational consequences.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.160]   That's all we can do.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.480]   - One interesting way to explore the Standard Model
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   is to look at your fun, nuanced disagreement
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.660]   with Carlo Rovelli.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.200]   When you talked about him writing in his book,
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.760]   electrons don't always exist,
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.360]   they exist when they interact.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.480]   They materialize in a place
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.080]   when they collide with something else.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.480]   And you wrote that, well, I'll just read the whole thing,
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.160]   'cause it's kind of interesting.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.480]   "Stocks may not achieve a precise value
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.820]   "until they are traded,
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.320]   "but that doesn't mean we can't approximate their worth
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.860]   "until they change hands.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:25.020]   "Similarly, electrons might not have definite properties,
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.620]   "but they do exist.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.500]   "It's true that the electron doesn't exist
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.120]   "as a classical object with definite position
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.440]   "until the position is measured,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.920]   "but something was there
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.400]   "which physicists use a wave function to describe."
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.640]   It's a fascinating, nuanced disagreement.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.120]   So do electrons always exist or not?
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.160]   Does a tree fall in the forest if nobody's there to see it?
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.120]   - So I like to think of the universe
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.600]   as being out there, whether or not.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.960]   I mean, it would be really weird
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.880]   if the only time things came into existence
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.080]   was when I saw them or I measured them.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.040]   - There's a lot of weird stuff.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.440]   - I mean, I could believe that the Middle East
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.760]   doesn't exist because I'm not there now.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   I mean, that would be kind of ridiculous.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.480]   I think we would all agree on that.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.880]   So I think there's only so much
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.360]   that we can attribute to our own powers of seeing.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.040]   And the whole system doesn't come into being
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.640]   because I'm measuring it.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.520]   And so what is weird,
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.680]   and this isn't even a disagreement about the standard model,
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.520]   this is a disagreement
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.360]   about how you interpret quantum mechanics.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.200]   I mean, I would say that those wave functions are real.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.600]   I mean, one of the things that,
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.560]   don't forget that particle physics does
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.120]   that quantum field theory says
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.680]   that electrons can be created and destroyed.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.760]   It's not that every electron has to be in the universe.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.200]   I mean, that's what happens at colliders,
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.080]   particles get created and destroyed.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.160]   But that doesn't mean that if I have an electron in an atom,
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.560]   it's not there, it's certainly there,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.200]   and we know about it, its charge is there.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.040]   - So physics is a kind of way to see the world.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:55.080]   So what, at the bottom, what's the bottom turtle?
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.920]   Do you have a sense that there's a bottom reality
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.200]   that we're trying to approximate with physics?
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.640]   - I think we always have in our head
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.680]   maybe that we'd like to find that,
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.760]   but I have to, I mean, I might not seem so,
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.640]   but I think I'm kind of more humble than a lot of physicists.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.800]   I'm not sure that we're ever gonna get to that bottom level,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.640]   but I do think we're going to keep penetrating
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.400]   different layers and get further.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.160]   - I just wonder how far away we are, you know?
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.680]   - We all wonder that.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.400]   It's not even, like, what's even the measure
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.760]   of how far away we are?
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.880]   I mean, one way you can measure it
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.440]   is just by our everyday lives.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.600]   In terms of our everyday lives,
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.000]   we've measured everything.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.360]   In terms of what underlies it, there's a lot more to see.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.840]   And so part of it has to do with how far we think we can go.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.440]   I mean, it might be that the nature of reality
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.800]   changes so much that even these terms are different.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   Maybe we'll measure, you know,
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   the notion of distance itself might break down at some point.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.200]   - But also to push back on the we've measured everything,
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.920]   maybe there's stuff we haven't even considered
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.000]   is measurable.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   For example, consciousness, or there's,
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.480]   there might be stuff, just like you said,
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.800]   forces unseen, undetected.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.760]   - So it's an interesting thing.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.400]   And this is often a confusion that happens.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.600]   So there's sort of the fundamental stuff underlying it,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.160]   and then there's sort of the higher levels,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.680]   what we'll call an effective theory at some level.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.400]   So we're not always working.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.480]   I mean, when I throw a ball,
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.520]   I don't tell you where every atom is.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.120]   I tell you there's a ball.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.040]   And so there might be different layers of reality
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.200]   that are built in terms of the matter that we know about,
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.480]   in terms of the stuff we know about.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.760]   And when I say we've measured everything,
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.880]   I say that with a grain of salt.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.400]   I mean, I measure everything about the stanomal.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.200]   So there's lots of phenomena that we don't understand,
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.040]   but often there are complex phenomena
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.800]   that will be given in terms of the fundamental ingredients
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.680]   that we know about.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.120]   - But that is an interesting question,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.160]   because yes, there's phenomena
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.240]   that are at the higher level of abstractions that emerge,
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.880]   but maybe, like with consciousness,
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.920]   there is far out people that think that consciousness
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.480]   is panpsychic, right?
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.880]   There's going to be almost like a fundamental force
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.520]   of physics that's consciousness,
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.000]   that permeates all matter, right?
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.240]   - Usually when you have a crazy, sorry,
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.560]   okay, when you have a far out theory,
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.200]   the thing you do is you test all the possibilities
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.640]   within the constructs that exist.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.360]   So you don't just jump to the most far out possibility.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.720]   I mean, you can do that, but then to see if it's true,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.760]   you either have to find evidence of it,
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.560]   or you have to show that it's not possible without that.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.480]   And we're very far from that.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.880]   - I think one of the criticisms of your theory
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.800]   on the dinosaurs was that it requires,
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.400]   if I remember correctly, for dark matter
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.480]   to be weirder than it already is.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.840]   And then I think you had a clever response to that.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.360]   Can you remind?
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.720]   - I'm not sure I remember what I said then,
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.360]   but I mean, we have no idea how weird dark matter is.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.120]   I mean, it's based on everyone thinking
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.560]   they know what dark matter is.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.160]   I mean, so weirder than it already is,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.520]   I mean, it's not already anything.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.760]   We don't know what it is.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.500]   So there's no normalization here.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.880]   - So dark matter, do we know
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.120]   if dark matter varies in density?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.120]   - It definitely does in the universe, just like,
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.760]   I mean, so for example, there's more dark matter
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.680]   in galaxies than there is between galaxies.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.720]   So it clumps, I mean, so it's matter.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.240]   So it's distributed like matter.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.760]   It is matter.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.060]   - It does clump.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.880]   But the full details of how it clumps,
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.680]   and the complexity of the clumping.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.960]   - It's understood pretty well.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.640]   People do simulations.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.800]   I mean, where people are always looking for things,
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.520]   including us as particle physics,
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.080]   it's sort of at small scales,
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.800]   or the deviations on small scales,
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.100]   so indicating other interactions or other processes,
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.520]   or interactions with baryons,
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.220]   that is to say normal matter that we don't understand.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.560]   But on large scales, we have a pretty good understanding
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.480]   of dark matter distribution.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.080]   - You were part of a recent debate on,
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.840]   quote, "Can science uncover reality?"
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.720]   Let me ask you this question then.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.920]   What do you think is the limits of science?
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.480]   - I'm smart enough to know I have no idea.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   And also, it's not even clear what science means, right?
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.160]   Because there's the science that we do,
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.320]   which is particle physics.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.040]   We try to find fundamental things
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.200]   and figure out what their effects are.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.340]   There's science like biology, where,
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.880]   you know, it's at a higher level.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.480]   The kind of questions you ask are different.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.720]   The kind of measurements are different.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.840]   The kind of science that's going to happen
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.600]   in the sort of more numerical age, I mean, or even AI,
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.200]   or like, what does it mean to answer a question?
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.760]   Does it mean that we can predict it?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.680]   Does it mean that we can reproduce it?
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.880]   So I think we're coming up against
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.200]   sort of the definition of what we mean by science
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.800]   as human beings.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.520]   So in terms of the science that we can do,
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.480]   I don't think we'll know it until we get there.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.200]   You know, we're trying to solve hard problems.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.160]   And, you know, we've made progress.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   I mean, if you think of how much science has advanced
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.380]   in the last century or century and a half, it's incredible.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.760]   I mean, you know, we didn't even know
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.400]   the universe was expanding
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.180]   at the beginning of the 20th century.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.440]   We didn't know about quantum mechanics
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.280]   in the beginning of the century.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.600]   We didn't know about special relativity.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.640]   That's a lot in a relatively short time,
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.440]   depending on how you think of time.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.720]   So I think it would be premature to say
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.440]   we know the limitations.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.080]   - And at various points throughout the history,
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.560]   we thought we solved everything, or declared,
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   or at least various people declared.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.320]   - Where we was various people, exactly.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, declared that we've solved everything.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.480]   So this is also a good place to maybe,
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.600]   could you describe the difference between top-down
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.120]   and bottom-up approaches to theoretical physics
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.840]   that you talked about in the book?
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.180]   - So you could try to jump in and say,
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.600]   I have a theory that I think is so perfect
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.520]   that I can predict everything from it,
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.920]   or at least predict some salient features from it.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.220]   - Mm-hmm, that's top-down.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.720]   - That would be top-down.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.640]   Bottom-up is more like the questions we just asked,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.760]   why are masses what they are?
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.640]   We measure things, we want to put them together.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.880]   And usually a good approach is to combine the two.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.200]   If you ask a very specific question,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.360]   but combine it with the methods of knowing
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.160]   that there could be a fundamental theory underlying it,
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.400]   sometimes you make progress.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.200]   I mean, the community tends to get segmented,
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.680]   or fragmented, into people who do one or the other.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.000]   But there are definitely times,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.480]   I mean, some of my best collaborations
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.160]   have been with people who are more top-down than I am,
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.320]   so that we come up with interesting ideas
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.400]   that we wouldn't have thought of
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.640]   if either one of us was working individually.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.600]   - Would you say the truly big leaps
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.480]   happen top-down, like Einstein?
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.240]   - Einstein was not a top-down person in the beginning.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.960]   Special relativity was very much him thinking about,
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.160]   you know, they were thought experiments,
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.880]   but he was very much, you know,
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.600]   the original theory about relativity
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.520]   is something like on the nature of electromagnetism.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.000]   He was trying to understand how Maxwell's laws
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.640]   could make sense when they were, you know,
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.160]   seemed to have different symmetries
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   than what we had thought they were.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.720]   So he was very much a bottom-up person.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.600]   And in fact, he resisted top-down for a long time.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.120]   Then when he tried to do the theory of general relativity,
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.280]   or the general theory of relativity,
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.360]   whichever you want to call it,
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.520]   incorporating gravity into the system
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.320]   where you need some feedback,
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.680]   then he was helped by a mathematician
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.000]   who had developed some differential geometry
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.240]   and helped him figure out how to write down that.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.480]   And after that, he thought top-down was the way to go,
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.280]   but he actually didn't make that much progress.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.000]   But certainly, so I think it's, you know,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.320]   naive to think it was just one or the other.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.720]   In fact, a lot of people who made real progress
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.120]   were rooted in actual measurements.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.600]   - Well, speaking of mathematicians,
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   what to you is the difference,
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.440]   because you've had a bit of foot in both,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.040]   between physics and mathematics
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.280]   in the way it helps us understand the world?
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.600]   - Well, there's, to be frank,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.880]   there's a lot more overlap in physics and math,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.440]   I think, than has been, I mean, well, maybe not more,
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.880]   but there's certainly a lot.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.720]   But I think, again, the kinds of questions you're asking
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.200]   are usually different.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.040]   Mathematicians like the structure itself.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.360]   Physicists are trying to concentrate on,
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.600]   to some extent, on the consequences for the world.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.680]   But there is a lot of overlap.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.300]   - The string theory is an example.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.720]   There's certain theories where there's a certain kind
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.440]   of mathematical beauty to it.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.160]   There's also some really cool ideas
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.840]   that you get in particle physics,
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.440]   where you can describe what's going on
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.620]   and connect it to other ideas.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.040]   That's also really beautiful.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.100]   I think, basically, insights can be beautiful.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:30.140]   They might seem simple, and sometimes they genuinely are.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.640]   And sometimes they're built on a whole system
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.780]   that you have to understand before.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.580]   I mean, if you actually saw Einstein's equations
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.000]   written out in components, you wouldn't think
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.840]   it's so beautiful.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.080]   You write it in a compact way, it looks nice.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.760]   - What do you think about the successes
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.000]   and the failures of string theory?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.440]   To what degree do you think it succeeded?
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.560]   To what degree is it not succeeded yet, or has failed?
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.760]   - I think to talk about any science
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.720]   in terms of success and failure often misses the point,
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.840]   because there's not some absolute thing.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.840]   And I do think that string theorists
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.420]   were a bit overly ambitious.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.400]   Not overly ambitious, but a little bit overly arrogant
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.640]   in the beginning, thinking they could solve many problems
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.040]   that they weren't going to solve.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.880]   That's not to say the methods and advances
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.380]   in string theory don't exist.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:22.560]   But they certainly weren't able to immediately solve
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.520]   all the problems they thought they could solve.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.040]   But it has given us tools.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.880]   It has given us some insights.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.960]   But it becomes almost a sociological question
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.200]   of how much it should be one or the other.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.000]   I do think that you can get caught up
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.040]   in the problems themselves,
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.960]   and sometimes you can get caught up in the methods
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.320]   and just sort of do other examples.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.040]   So the real physics insights often come from people
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.500]   who are thinking about physics as well as math.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.160]   - 'Cause you mentioned AI.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.840]   There's hope that AI might be able to help
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.720]   find some interesting insights.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.360]   I mean, another question, another way to ask this question
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.080]   is how special are humans that we're able to discover
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.800]   novel insights about the world?
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.300]   - That's a great question.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.280]   And it depends on what kind of insights
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.620]   and what we're going to find that out.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.480]   I mean, because it's hard to think about something
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.680]   that doesn't quite exist yet.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.000]   I mean, I could just think about something,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.160]   take a step back.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.760]   It's a little bit like trying to say in four dimensions,
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.440]   you go back to three dimensions,
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.800]   so to go to something you can imagine.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.040]   So you can sort of say a lot of the things
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.280]   in a very different level about the internet.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.360]   You could say, has the internet helped do things?
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.720]   And that's, it definitely took on a life of its own
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.600]   in some sense, but it's also something
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.320]   that we're able to tame.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.560]   I know that I myself wouldn't have been able to write books
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.780]   if the internet didn't exist,
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.600]   because I wouldn't have had the time to go to a library
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.920]   and look everything up.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.000]   And it helped me enormously.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.520]   And in some sense, AI could be that in a very nice world.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.920]   It could be a tool that helps us go a step further
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.480]   than we would and a lot more efficiently.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.280]   And it's already done that to some extent.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.780]   Or it could be like the parts of the internet
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.400]   that we can't control, that are ruining politics or whatever.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.440]   So, and there's certainly a lot of indications
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.760]   that can do that.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.000]   Then there are even bigger things that people speculate
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.120]   about AI being able to do its own things.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.080]   But in terms of actually figuring things out,
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.440]   we're in the early stages.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.880]   - Yeah, there's several directions here.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.640]   One is like on the theorem prover side,
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.520]   so Wolfram Alpha, where everything is much more precise.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.960]   And we have large language model type of stuff.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:47.360]   One of the limitations of those is it seems to come up
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.520]   with convincing looking things,
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.320]   which we don't know if it's true or not.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.160]   And that's a big problem for physics.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.760]   - So large language models are more or less
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.640]   like generalizations of stuff that we have.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.200]   So the question is, so there's still breakthroughs
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.880]   in AI waiting to happen and maybe they are happening.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.280]   And maybe they'll be good, maybe not.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.880]   But that's not quite the same.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.120]   I mean, maybe just some, in some cases,
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.480]   it's just pattern recognition
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.680]   that leads to important things.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.440]   But sometimes it could be something more insightful
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.820]   than that, that I can't even put my finger on.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.440]   So it forces us to, I mean,
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.320]   we don't really understand how smart we are.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.160]   We don't understand how we think about things
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.440]   all that well, actually.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.640]   But one thing is true,
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.760]   though we're a lot more efficient right now than computers
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.680]   and coming up with things.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.840]   We require a lot less energy to do that.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.240]   So if computers figure out how to do that,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.640]   then it's gonna be a totally different ball game.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.160]   So, and so there are clearly kinds of connections
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.360]   that we don't know how we're making, but we are making them.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.120]   And so that's going to be interesting.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.140]   So, I say we're in early stages,
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.740]   but this is changing very rapidly.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.460]   But right now, I don't think that it's actually,
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.020]   we've discovered new laws of physics,
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.780]   but could it in the future?
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.240]   Maybe it can.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.700]   - It will raise big questions about
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:13.860]   what is special about humans that we don't quite appreciate?
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.020]   There could be things that are like
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.860]   that leap of insight that happens.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.080]   Truly novel ideas.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.180]   That could potentially be very difficult to do.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:28.960]   - So there are sort of abstract questions like that.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.720]   There's also questions of how is it
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.400]   that we can address to some extent,
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.920]   how will AI be used in the context of the world we live in?
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.560]   Which is based on, at least our country's based on
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.040]   capitalism and a certain political system.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.800]   And how will global politics deal with it?
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.480]   How will our capitalist system deal with it?
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.460]   What will be the things that we focus on doing with it?
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.980]   How much will researchers get control of it
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.500]   to be able to ask different sorts of questions?
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.500]   I mean, while it was starting out,
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.980]   people were doing these kind of toy problems,
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.060]   but what will it actually be applied to
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.220]   and what will it be optimized to do?
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.400]   There's a lot of questions out there
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.700]   that it's really important we start addressing.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:16.980]   - What to you is the most beautiful unsolved problem
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.600]   in physics and cosmology?
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.680]   What to you is really exciting if we can unlock
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.320]   the mystery of in the next few decades?
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.600]   - So is it what's the most beautiful unsolved problem
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.240]   or what is the most beautiful unsolved problem
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.840]   I think we can make progress on?
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.000]   - Oh boy.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.720]   We make progress on in the next few centuries.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.560]   - Most of the questions, the big questions,
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.100]   have to do with what underlies things,
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.580]   how things started, what's at the base of it.
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.580]   There's also just basic questions like
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.100]   that you asked earlier, how far will science take us?
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.300]   How much can we understand?
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.740]   There are questions like how we got here,
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.380]   what underlies it, are there, you know?
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.420]   But also, I mean, there's really deep questions
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.420]   like what fraction are we actually seeing?
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.780]   If there are these other forces,
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.060]   if there is another way of seeing the world,
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:15.060]   are there galaxies, universes beyond our own?
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.540]   If they're so totally different,
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.900]   how do we even comprehend them?
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.340]   I mean, how do we detect,
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.440]   like what would we even think about them?
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   So there's a lot about trying to get beyond,
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.780]   it's always just getting beyond our limited vision
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.700]   and limited experience and trying to see what underlies it,
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.540]   both at small scales and at large scales.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.260]   We just don't know the answers.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.900]   I mean, I'd like to think that we understand more
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.860]   about dark matter, about dark energy,
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.260]   about are there extra dimensions,
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.820]   things that we actually work on.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.580]   'Cause there's probably a lot beyond what we work on
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.040]   that's yet to be discovered.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:52.420]   - Yeah, understanding the extra dimensions piece
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.980]   will be really interesting.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.220]   - Totally.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.860]   I mean, if it is how the universe went
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.920]   from higher dimensions to what we see,
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.180]   are the extra dimensions present everywhere?
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.120]   I mean, one of the really interesting pieces of physics
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.940]   we did that I talk about in my first book, "War Passages,"
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.420]   finding out that there can be a higher dimension,
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.460]   but only locally do you think there's a gravity
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.860]   of a lower dimension.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.980]   So it could be like only locally do we think
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.020]   we live in three dimensions,
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.060]   it could be higher dimensions, it's different.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.380]   It's not actually the gravity we have,
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.420]   but there's all sorts of phenomena
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.260]   that might be out there that we don't know about.
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.660]   All sorts of evolution things,
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:34.300]   time dependence that we don't know about.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.460]   And of course, that's from the point of view
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.300]   of particle physics.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.740]   From the point of view of other kinds of physics,
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.500]   we're just beginning, so who knows?
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.060]   - Yeah, if the physics changes throughout,
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.260]   is not homogeneous throughout the universe,
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.420]   that would be weird.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.500]   - I mean, for the observable universe, it's the same,
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.640]   but beyond the observable universe, who knows?
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.680]   - What advice would you give?
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.460]   You've had an exceptional career.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.260]   What advice would you give to young people,
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.780]   maybe high school, college,
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.780]   on how to have a career they can be proud of
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.980]   and a life they can be proud of?
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.500]   - I think the weird thing about being a scientist
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.260]   or an academic in general is,
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.860]   you have to believe really strongly in what you do
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.980]   while questioning it all the time.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.780]   You can't, and that's a hard balance to have.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.140]   Sometimes it helps to collaborate with people,
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.260]   but to really believe that you could have good ideas
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.100]   at the same time knowing they could all be wrong,
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.900]   that's a tough tightrope to walk sometimes,
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.920]   but to really test them out.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.220]   The other thing is sometimes, if you get too far buried,
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.660]   you look out and you think, oh, there's so much out there,
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.340]   and sometimes it's just good to bring it back home
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.300]   and just think, okay, can I have as good an idea
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.260]   as the person next to me,
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.500]   rather than the greatest physicist who ever lived?
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.260]   But right now, like you said,
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.220]   I think there's lots of big issues out there,
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.460]   and it's hard to balance that.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.740]   Sometimes it's hard to forget the role of physics,
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.980]   but I think Wilson said it really well
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.820]   when he said, when they were building Fermilab,
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.040]   it was like, this won't defend the country,
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.060]   but it'll make it worth defending.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.620]   It's just the idea that in all this chaos,
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.540]   it's still important that we still make progress
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.140]   in these things, and sometimes,
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.900]   when major world events are happening,
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.460]   it's easy to forget that,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.640]   and I think those are important, too.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.660]   You don't wanna forget those,
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.500]   but to try to keep that balance
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.900]   because we don't wanna lose what it is
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.740]   that makes humans special.
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.780]   - So that's the big picture.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:26.940]   Would you also lose yourself
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.160]   in the simple joy of puzzle solving?
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:34.660]   I mean, we all like solving puzzles,
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.160]   and actually, one of the things that drives me
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.540]   in my research is inconsistencies.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.860]   When things don't make sense, it really bugs me,
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:44.220]   and it just will go in different directions
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.260]   to see how could these things fit together.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.780]   - So it bugs you, but that motivates you.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.660]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:50.760]   - Until it doesn't.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.060]   - Because I think, 'cause I have this underlying belief
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.100]   that it should make sense,
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.380]   even though the world comes at you in many ways
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.460]   and tells you nothing should make sense,
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.020]   but if you believe that it makes sense,
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:02.100]   then you look for underlying logic,
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.140]   and I think that's just good advice for everything,
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.840]   to try to find why is it the way it is.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.160]   I think, I talk about effective theory
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.800]   in my second book, "Noggin in Heaven's Door," a lot.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.000]   It's sort of, rather than ask the big questions,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.340]   sometimes we just ask the questions
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.040]   about the immediate things that we can measure,
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.160]   and we can, like I said, we can sometimes tell one
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.720]   that will fail, but we can have these effective theories,
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.080]   and sometimes I think when we approach these big questions,
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.760]   it's good to do it from an effective theory point.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.960]   Why do I find this satisfying?
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.000]   Why is the world we have the way it is?
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.340]   We think things are beautiful that we live in.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.660]   I mean, I'm not sure if we had different senses
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.880]   or different ways of looking at things,
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.760]   we wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful,
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.680]   but I have to say, it is kind of fantastic
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.120]   that no matter how many times I see a sunset,
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.420]   I will always find it beautiful.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.340]   It's like, I don't think I'd ever see a sunset
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.020]   and say, "Uh, whatever."
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.320]   It's just always beautiful.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.500]   And so there are things that as humans
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.560]   clearly resonate with us,
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:00.880]   but we were maybe evolved that way, but that's about us.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.800]   But in terms of figuring out the universe,
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.220]   it's kind of amazing how far we've gotten.
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.780]   We have discovered many, many wonderful things,
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.440]   but there's a lot more out there,
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.920]   and I hope we have the opportunity to keep going.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.760]   - And with effective theories, one small step at a time,
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.200]   just keep unraveling the mystery.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.040]   - But also having in mind the big questions,
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.280]   but doing one small step at a time, exactly.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.960]   - Yeah, looking out to the stars.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.320]   You said the sunset.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.580]   For me, it's the sunset, the sunrise,
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.680]   and just looking at the stars.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:35.120]   It's wondering what's all out there,
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.640]   and having a lot of hope that humans will figure it out.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.020]   - Right, I like it.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:45.400]   - Lisa, thank you for being one of the humans
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.580]   in the world that are pushing it forward
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.440]   and figuring out this beautiful puzzle of ours,
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.600]   and thank you for talking today.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.480]   This was amazing.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.320]   - Thank you.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.680]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.880]   with Lisa Randell.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.000]   To support this podcast,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.520]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.400]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.280]   from Albert Einstein.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.760]   The important thing is to not stop questioning.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.920]   Curiosity has its own reason for existence.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.620]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.780]   (upbeat music)
