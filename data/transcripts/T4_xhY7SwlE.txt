[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Happy Friday, everyone. Today we have a question from Wilmie, a listener to the podcast, who writes,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.560]   "Good afternoon, Pastor John. I'm from South Africa, and I would really like to know whether
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.000]   it is sinful for me to eat pork and bacon. This topic has actually brought my marriage a lot of
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.040]   heartache, as my husband is a firm believer of the laws of Moses. And although he doesn't keep them
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.160]   all, pork is a big no-no for him. What would you say to Wilmie, Pastor John?"
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.200]   There have always been groups of Christians who believe that in order to honor God's authority
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:43.280]   in the Old Testament, we must continue to obey the food laws and other ceremonial laws, lest
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:54.480]   we be found in disobedience. There's a good impulse in this and a profoundly bad impulse
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.480]   in this. The good impulse is the desire to obey God. Nothing wrong with that. That belongs to
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.160]   what it means to be a Christian. The bad impulse is the failure to obey Christ, who teaches us how
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.480]   to obey God in regard to the Old Testament. So the good impulse starts perhaps with the text like
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.120]   Matthew 5, 17 to 18. Jesus says, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.520]   I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. For truly I say to you, until heaven and
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.720]   earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished."
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.200]   And the good impulse puts the emphasis on every dot, every iota of the law standing until the
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:58.400]   earth passes away. And the bad impulse neglects the words, "I have come to fulfill them," and the
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:08.640]   words, "until all is accomplished." In other words, the bad impulse fails to see in Jesus the kind of
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.400]   fulfillment and the kind of accomplishment of the law and the prophets that God always intended in
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:26.000]   the Old Testament as the consummation and the end of the ceremonial laws. So the effort to hold on
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   to the prohibition of eating pork is, in effect, a refusal to submit to God's plan
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   for the fulfillment of the law in Jesus. So let's be specific now. Take the laws about
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:52.000]   foods in the Old Testament, unclean foods, which include pork. Jesus said something very specific
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.760]   about this in Mark 7, 15 to 19. He said this, "There's nothing outside a person that by going
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.280]   into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him. And when he
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.600]   had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:21.120]   And he said to them, 'Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:30.400]   into a person from outside cannot defile him, since it enters not his heart, but his stomach
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:41.440]   and is expelled?' Thus he declared all foods clean." Now there's the key text for our friend.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:52.160]   In other words, the prohibition of certain foods as unclean was a temporary part of God's way
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   of making Israel distant or distinct from the nations of the world. Now with the coming of
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.000]   Christ, dramatic changes take place in the way God governs his people, because we are no longer
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.920]   a political ethnic people like the Jews were, but a global people from every tribe and language and
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   ethnicity and race. With that dramatic change, Christians are woven into every culture on the
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.960]   planet and face hundreds of ethical dilemmas about what aspects of those cultures to share—what to
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.440]   eat, what not to eat, when to eat, how to eat—but God never solves that problem of being distinct
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.960]   from the world, which we still should be, by preserving the Old Testament ceremonial laws
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.200]   of circumcision and food laws. You can read about it in 1 Corinthians 8, 1 Corinthians 10, how he
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.040]   went about wrestling with those issues, and that wasn't the way he did it, namely by sending
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.520]   everybody back to the laws of the Old Testament. So this is what the dispute behind the book of
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.480]   Galatians is all about. What's the place of circumcision? And days and months and years—Galatians
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:26.080]   4.10. Now Paul's position in Galatians is that circumcision is of no effect. And then he says,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.240]   chapter 5, verse 6, "In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.880]   anything, in spite of the command in the Old Testament to be circumcised. It doesn't count
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.600]   for anything but only faith working through love." And he could have just as easily said,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.960]   "Neither pork eating nor non-pork eating counts for anything but only faith working through love."
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.520]   So we're free to eat pork, but Galatians 5.2 makes it really stunningly clear what we are not
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:10.320]   free to do with pork. Here's what Galatians 5.2 says, "Look, I, Paul, say to you, if you accept
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:19.040]   circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you." Whoa! I thought you said it doesn't matter
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   whether we have circumcision or not. You can have it or not have it. You said that in verse 6.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:37.520]   What Paul means is, if you embrace circumcision or pork eating as a new law, a new necessity for
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.680]   justification, or in the case of the Galatians, even a new necessity for ongoing, real, mature,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.920]   spiritual, genuine Christian maturity, you're cutting yourself off from Christ if you treat
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:59.840]   pork eating or circumcision that way, and that is serious. So the final answer is,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:08.720]   if a person chooses not to eat pork for various nutritional reasons or preference, this is no
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   big deal. You are free to eat or not to eat. But the moment that abstinence is invested with
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.360]   biblical authority as the path of obedience or maturity or salvation, a line is crossed
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:33.120]   that contradicts Christ and the gospel. And Paul says in Colossians 2.16,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.400]   "Let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food or drink. These are but a shadow of the
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:48.960]   things to come. The substance belongs to Christ." When you have Christ as your treasure and you're
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:58.080]   all satisfying food, you are free to eat pork or not. Amen. Such a critical warning and a critical
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.440]   key for unlocking the meaning of our Bibles and seeing the magnificent glory of Jesus Christ.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.160]   miscarriage, and this man is wondering if his struggle with lust, namely his addiction to
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.040]   pornography, has anything to do with the miscarriage as divine punishment on his sin.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.960]   There are a lot of complicated questions to work through, and we will do that on Monday.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.200]   I'm your host, Tony Rengie. We'll see you then.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:43.440]   Amen.
