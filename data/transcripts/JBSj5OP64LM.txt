[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.640]   - Do you think we will ever create an AI system
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.480]   that we can love and loves us back
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.980]   in a deep, meaningful way like in the movie "Her"?
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.640]   - I think AI will be capable of convincing you
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.000]   to fall in love with it very well.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.880]   - And that's different than us humans?
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.480]   - You know, we're sort of getting into
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.640]   a metaphysical question of like, do emotions and thoughts
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800]   exist in a different realm than the physical?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.520]   And maybe they do, maybe they don't, I don't know.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.000]   But from a physics standpoint, I tend to think of things,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.600]   like physics was my main sort of training.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.560]   And from a physics standpoint, essentially,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.400]   if it loves you in a way that you can't tell
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.360]   whether it's real or not, it is real.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.280]   - It's a physics view of love.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.120]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.880]   If you cannot prove that it does not,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.200]   if there's no test that you can apply
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.320]   that would make it,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.080]   allow you to tell the difference,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660]   then there is no difference, right?
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.280]   - And it's similar to seeing our world as simulation.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.080]   There may not be a test to tell the difference
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.560]   between what the real world and the simulation,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.040]   and therefore, from a physics perspective,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.480]   it might as well be the same thing.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.320]   - Yes.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.280]   And there may be ways to test whether it's a simulation.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.200]   There might be, I'm not saying there aren't,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.080]   but you could certainly imagine that a simulation
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.240]   could correct that once an entity in the simulation
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240]   found a way to detect the simulation,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.520]   it could either restart, pause the simulation,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.040]   start a new simulation, or do one of many other things
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.820]   that then corrects for that error.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.980]   (silence)
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.140]   (silence)
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.300]   (silence)
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.460]   (silence)
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.620]   (silence)
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.780]   (silence)
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.940]   (silence)
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.100]   (silence)
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:16.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
