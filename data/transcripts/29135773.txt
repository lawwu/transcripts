[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.240]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.000]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.660]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.160]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.520]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.560]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.980]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.160]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.360]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.560]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.640]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.120]   But don't forget,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.680]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.680]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.840]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.080]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.500]   Well friends, I'm so excited to be spending
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740]   the Christmas season with you.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.900]   Or as one of my friends said,
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.860]   this is really the Advent season
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.500]   because we are looking at the coming of the Christ child
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.600]   and Christmas doesn't begin in earnest until the 25th.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.700]   And then we have 12 days of Christmas
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.320]   that go from the 25th to January the 12th.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.960]   And so that's just January the 6th.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.520]   So that's just an awesome way to look at it.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.440]   But I've got a suggestion for your family,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.640]   for all our families really, this Christmas.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.640]   What if we intentionally spent time together
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.800]   doing the simplest things?
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.420]   What if we practiced some simple habits
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.480]   designed to draw us to one another,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.640]   designed to start meaningful conversations,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000]   designed to provoke us to deeper thinking,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.020]   and to encourage us to true worship?
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.880]   What if y'all, in this season of busy, busy, busy,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   we celebrated Christmas by praying together,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.720]   playing together, reading together,
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   exploring together, and serving together?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   So this Advent season, the everyday educator
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.840]   wants to practice these habits along with you.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.600]   And we're gonna talk to others who want to try this plan too.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.840]   So you guys listen in every Tuesday
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   to ponder the next habit.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   And today we're gonna be thinking about exploring together.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.400]   And I have one of my favorite friends
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.320]   to talk about this with, Amy Jones.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.060]   Amy, Merry Christmas.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.000]   - Oh, Merry Christmas, Lisa.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.240]   And what a lovely way to start the season,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   to just practice those simple habits like you were saying,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.720]   and really be, it's like you can be
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.200]   keeping things really simple but intentional.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.160]   And I think that is, those two things
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   marry really well together because you are thinking
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.840]   you're not just flying by the seat of your pants,
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   which I just thought, but you're actually thinking,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.260]   looking for opportunities to intentionally incorporate
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.680]   those lovely habits.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.120]   And it does help you simplify, it helps you slow down.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.520]   So that's great.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.240]   - And I think simplifying and slowing down
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.660]   and being intentional really are the best ways
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.120]   to make good memories with our families.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.640]   And that's what we're all after,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.360]   not just doing another thing.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.320]   You know what, Amy?
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.820]   I think that those of us, and I'm including myself,
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.000]   who fall into the busy, busy trap of this season
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.580]   are doing it to make memories.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.320]   So we say yes to the get together,
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.800]   or yes to the Christmas caroling,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.220]   or yes to the neighborhood potluck,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   all in search of memories that will delight and last.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.580]   But what I have discovered is the more frenzied I become,
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.720]   the less I make a memory I want to hold onto,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.240]   the more I'm just tired and maybe going through the motion.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.360]   So I love what you said about simplifying
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.480]   and being intentional, and I submit to you guys
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.300]   that those are two things that make the very best memories.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.280]   So Amy and I are gonna talk today
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.160]   about the habit of exploring together
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.380]   and what might that look like at Christmas.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.800]   But I wanna ask you first, Amy,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.680]   did you consider yourself a curious child?
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.040]   Like, were you curious about things?
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.160]   - Oh, yes, I think I was naturally pretty curious.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.040]   I don't know if I would have,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.880]   I think some people would have said quirky.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.120]   (laughing)
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.680]   I'm staying curious.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.880]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.480]   - I did just ask a lot of questions,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.600]   and I think I lived on a farm,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.960]   and so I was given a lot of time to wander around
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   and just poke and prod at different parts of the world,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.280]   and we had animals on our farms.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   So there was always something around
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   that was pretty wonderful to kind of explore.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.300]   So I think I naturally did that.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.460]   Now, people express their curiosity
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.200]   in so many different ways.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.160]   Some people are curious about words,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.080]   or some people are curious about nature,
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.640]   and we usually associate it with nature.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.920]   But some people are curious about how you make a better meal
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.040]   or how you create a story.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.480]   So I think children, to help recognize
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.260]   that children have natural curiosities
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.000]   that are individualized to them,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.720]   and just to kind of recognize it instead of thinking,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.280]   oh, they just like to play ball.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.660]   Well, there's a curiosity there
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.220]   that they're exploring naturally.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.920]   So I think sometimes we relegate exploring
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.840]   to like nature or that sort of thing,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.840]   whereas really, God has given us natural curiosities
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.040]   about so many different things.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.060]   And I think recognizing those in your children
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.960]   instead of calling them quirky, maybe.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.800]   - Yes, yes.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.840]   - Just be curious about things like rocks and bugs.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.440]   - Yeah, yeah, that was such a good insight, Amy.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.640]   That was a really good insight.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.560]   I was, I grew up as a city child.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.100]   So I lived in the city when I was little.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.980]   And so my curiosity did tend to be about words.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.380]   I loved to read from an early age.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.200]   But I was also curious about how things worked.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.500]   And I can remember, 'cause I did play outside a lot.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.880]   I still was from that generation where mom said,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.180]   okay, time to go outside.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.520]   And you just went out and you played.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   And so I remember, even as a little, little person
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.120]   trying to explain the world to myself,
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.720]   I was curious about how things worked.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.440]   And I can remember being outside in the summertime
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.840]   and knowing that a storm was about to come up.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.480]   You know, the sky would get really purpley dark
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.260]   and you would hear the rumbles maybe of thunder
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.720]   in the distance, and the wind would pick up.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.820]   And always, and I noticed,
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.080]   this is before I was in kindergarten,
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.200]   I noticed that the leaves always turned,
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.680]   the backs of the leaves.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.960]   And I didn't know, that was really weird to me.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.360]   And they looked a different color,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.420]   but I could tell it was just 'cause I was seeing the back.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.560]   And I called them, for some reason, cheese trees.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.960]   And so my little self, it's like, okay,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.640]   so it's getting ready to be a storm
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.320]   because they're cheese trees.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.800]   And I think I said that to my mom one time.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.460]   And she was like, now what, what is there, what, there, what?
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.340]   And I was sort of embarrassed, but it was because,
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.200]   and I, so I was real sensitive to my children
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.280]   when they came up with these phrases,
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.760]   because it was a way that I had explained the world
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.760]   to my little four-year-old mind.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.000]   And that's what, I was exploring the world.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.980]   Did you have explorer kids, Amy,
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.080]   did you have kids who liked to explore?
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.840]   - Yes, and that was one of the benefits of homeschooling.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.560]   I got to watch them explore.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.440]   You know, I was part of that, you know,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.800]   they're exploring and kind of offering opportunities
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.480]   for them to explore in their way.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   My oldest was a constant outdoors person.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.200]   He had a stick in his hand since he was one.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.240]   He was always poking and prodding.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.320]   And he was a wanderer.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.900]   You know, he just, he looked very much,
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.160]   he's a very internal processor,
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.560]   that's what I would say now.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.580]   But he would just, I would look at him
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.140]   and it would look like he was just spacing out, you know?
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.120]   - He's just thinking about things.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.620]   - And thinking and looking and turning over things.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.080]   And then just, he was much more of that kind of person.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.920]   And my daughter was more like you.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.260]   She was a real words and relationship person.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.400]   So she was always trying to make sense of interactions
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.280]   and how do we encourage people.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   I mean, I had to recently cleaned out the number of notes
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.160]   that she wrote me almost every day.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   I had stacks and stacks of hearts and I love yous.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.840]   And so she was always exploring in those terms,
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.260]   like how relationships work and how she could use her words.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.640]   And she loved reading.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.480]   So there were those and then my other sons
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.080]   are sports boys, you know, active.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.800]   So they were always like trying things
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.340]   with mechanical things or make them go faster
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.320]   or hit harder or destroy more.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.480]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.200]   How many ways can I break this?
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.340]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.280]   Can I turn, set something on fire?
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.080]   I was like, no, you can't.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.380]   - Yes, you cannot.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.240]   - I can remember coming home one time to discover
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.040]   that my husband had taught the girls
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.780]   and they were not old, okay?
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.480]   So they were like, you know, seven and five,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.960]   had taught them how to burn a leaf
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.560]   using a magnifying glass in the sun.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.600]   And I was like, you know, I'm not really sure
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   that that's a good skill to pass on to them at five and seven.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.000]   But they loved it, you know?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.060]   What can the sun do and what can this magnifying glass do
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.400]   and what could it turn into?
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.560]   I think that kids are natural explorers
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.820]   and I really, I love what you said,
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.580]   your admonition to us to look for ways
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.580]   in which our children are exploring
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.760]   because they don't all look the same.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.500]   It's not just the kids that want to turn over rocks
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.040]   that are explorers.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.080]   It's all, I think all of our kids are natural explorers
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.880]   and sometimes parents, and I'm saying this
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.160]   because I think I fell into this trap,
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.060]   sometimes we numb the explorer out of our children
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.720]   by giving them too much information
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.140]   before they've asked for more information,
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.200]   when they are just out exploring,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.080]   when they're just trying things out.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.160]   And I think it's out of a good heart.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.060]   I know that I was so excited to see my girls explore things
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.200]   that I think I probably drowned them in extraneous facts
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.680]   and interesting tidbits when they were still just kind of,
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.480]   like you said, poking around
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.820]   to seeing if it was interesting to them.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.260]   So that's another, I guess, admonition for all of us.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.600]   What is so great?
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.360]   What do you think is the greatest thing
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.760]   about exploring with your kids?
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.220]   And how did you encourage them to keep doing it?
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.680]   - Oh, that's such a good question.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.760]   I think the best thing is what you just alluded to,
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.760]   is that you give them time and space to explore.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:03.120]   And if we think about when we're first curious
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   about something, nice to have space to kind of go
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.320]   in all the rabbit trails and ask all kinds of questions
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.520]   that I may think you have these questions,
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.560]   but actually like you have a cheese tree.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.980]   I would have never imagined a cheese tree,
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.980]   but I would be curious about you,
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.100]   that time and focus that you had.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.300]   You made a definition of something
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.200]   that was really creative based on a lot
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.340]   of observation and thought.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.040]   So you came to a conclusion,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.700]   but it was the time and space that you needed to do that.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.260]   I think for parents, we're tempted to sort of shape it.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.740]   We think we'll lead to,
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.640]   oh, this would be a good science lesson,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.220]   or this would be, let me tell you even more,
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.000]   that sometimes we don't mean to, but I have done this,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.620]   kind of steal away the creativity
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.620]   that God has put in their mind that we don't.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.620]   I think I forget that children are looking at things
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.860]   from such a different perspective.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.860]   We're rhetoricians, we've seen a tree a thousand times,
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.840]   but our children, our little children,
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.800]   they may have experienced this only one or two times
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.100]   in their life, for Christmas.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.140]   They may, if they're four, they've only had
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.520]   maybe one Christmas they remember.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.520]   So everything from their perspective really is new.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.980]   And I think entering into that with them
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.080]   and allowing them really listening,
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.620]   what are they asking?
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.060]   What are they asking?
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.380]   And what are they observing?
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.380]   And just asking questions and being still with them.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.980]   I think, like you were saying, frenzy,
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.620]   to me frenzy is usually that meant
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.420]   I was completely distracted.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.660]   I was not present in the moment.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.660]   - Always on the way to the next thing.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.860]   - Yes, I was like looking at the calendar
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.700]   and going, well, when can we get through the play
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.620]   so we can go to the after play?
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.740]   Instead of going, at this moment,
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.140]   I'm gonna be present with where I am, where they are,
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.180]   and give them kind of space and really listen and hone in.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.740]   I think that is the most beautiful picture
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.780]   we have of Christ.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.460]   He was always asking, come join me.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.660]   But he was alongside.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.420]   He was with people and really present with people.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.020]   So I didn't get the feeling that Jesus was thinking,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.480]   oh, hurry up and finish your conversation.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.820]   He was really at peace and allowed for a lot of connection
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.580]   with where people were.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.840]   And I think for me, I failed at that.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.760]   As a parent, I was always pushing the next thing
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   to check off the list.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.760]   So I think as a grandparent, I see the wisdom of moments
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.240]   of just being with your child and recognizing
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.160]   where they are and giving them space and time.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.400]   - Yes, that is so true.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.760]   I know that sometimes as parents,
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.360]   we are tempted to explore with our children,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.580]   but we have a goal in mind.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.020]   We have a thing, we have the answer.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.140]   What your exploration is gonna show you
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.060]   is fill in the blank.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.060]   And so we're not open-ended in the explorations.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.620]   And that robs our children, I think.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.780]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.700]   It robs us.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.580]   Think of it, if you were invited to a nice meal
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.060]   and the host just kept asking you,
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.260]   well, did you notice this?
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.140]   Did you see this?
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.400]   Do you know what this is made of?
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.680]   Can you eat faster?
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.240]   (laughs)
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.180]   I think you would feel very, yeah, very hemmed in.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.900]   (laughs)
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.500]   And I think I've done that because I feel like
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.240]   we think of ourselves, we take the responsibility
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.520]   of educating our children very seriously.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   And I think we also wanna respond to that at times
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.080]   by just like we think throwing information at people
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.360]   is part of education.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.660]   I think that's my old education mindset
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.660]   instead of really what we wanna do is engage
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.260]   and relate, be in relationship with a person.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.280]   That's, you're never teaching the thing,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.100]   whatever your science, you're teaching the person.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.800]   That's really the difference.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.900]   And so focusing on the person,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.260]   the little person that's sitting in front of you.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.640]   And like you said, giving them opportunity to say things
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.040]   that maybe sound silly to you as an adult,
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.500]   but kind of pressing in and understanding
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.860]   what they're getting at,
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.300]   which is pretty creative most of the time.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.060]   - Yes, yes.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.560]   Oh, that's so lovely.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.720]   I could just talk to you forever about this.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.760]   But I wanna ask you,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.560]   are y'all big Christmas people at your house?
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.560]   Do you decorate and bake and sing and give presents
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.980]   and keep secrets and worship and read and all the things?
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.560]   Do you, are y'all big Christmas celebrators?
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.940]   - I have to attribute that to my husband.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.040]   He is just, he loves celebrating Christmas.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.080]   He loves the whole package
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.520]   because he just feels like it's one of the best holidays
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.040]   of Christ coming to earth.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.760]   You know, what in the world, you know,
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.640]   that he was willing to come.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.560]   And he's always said, he's a literature person.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   He always says that the story is just so lovely.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.840]   And who would have ever put those things together?
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.620]   Babies and mangers and angels and shepherds and wise men.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.280]   And, you know, who would have created that beautiful story
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.680]   except for the Lord?
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.840]   I mean, and he just glories in it.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.580]   So yes, we do Christmas trees and presents
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.220]   and food and gatherings.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.820]   And yes, it's a flurry.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.380]   And our house has many, many of those annoying toys
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.660]   that make lots of noise.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.000]   (laughing)
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.020]   - Yes, hang around from year to year.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.940]   So what is one family tradition
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.240]   that is especially important to your family
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.320]   and how did it get started?
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.240]   - Oh yeah, that is such a good, another good question.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.080]   It made me think.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:43.120]   I think one of the things that we really enjoyed
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.120]   was the idea of just, of doing a Jesse tree.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.020]   We, it's, we do, it's just really simple
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.460]   and it traces the prophecies of Christ through,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.980]   you know, starts the Old Testament and goes through
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.940]   and it's just little stories of just the history
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.040]   and how Christ, the prophecies of Christ
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.660]   and Christ shows up from the beginning.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.520]   And it's, and you just hang a little ornament on a tree
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.320]   every day, it's very plain,
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   but it's just a mark of the end of the day.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.960]   We used to do it with the children
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.280]   when the children were home as our devotional in the morning
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.940]   and each person every day got to hang an ornament
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.180]   on the tree, you know, we just took her.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.820]   So we did have arguments about who would hang baby Jesus
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.640]   at the end. - Yes, the favorite ornaments,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.460]   yep. (laughing)
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.580]   - And so that was, I had to keep a record,
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.060]   I actually found it the other day.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.020]   - Oh my gosh, Amy, that's so funny, yes.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.460]   - But like, you know, like, and what I'm saying there is,
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.700]   it wasn't this perfect Norman Rockwell moment.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.540]   We had fights about where to hang baby Jesus.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.820]   - Right, and you just think, really, we're gonna fight,
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.060]   I can remember telling the girls,
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.980]   really, we're gonna fight about baby Jesus.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.860]   Do you hear how crazy this is?
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.540]   - Yes, but it was, but our children loved it.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.000]   You know, they just loved the routine
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.060]   and sometimes they normally, they got a little bit
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.540]   of a candy or a hot chocolate, you know,
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.780]   something like that, so it made it an extra sweet time.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.100]   But yeah, those kind of things that we tried
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.000]   to just incorporate that.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.320]   - That's really cool.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   Well, in an effort to lead us all to simplify Advent,
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.980]   Everyday Educator has been looking at
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.500]   how to take the simple verbs
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.780]   from the Scribblers at Home resource,
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.140]   pray, play, read, explore, and serve,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.880]   and use those verbs to guide our Christmas celebrations.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.480]   So I wanna talk to you more specifically
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   about how we can celebrate together this year by exploring.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.620]   So we have already well established
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.300]   that kids love exploring.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.780]   So it seems like it would be easy to entice them
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.420]   to look at Christmas and the message of Christmas
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.580]   through an explorer's eyes.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.580]   So what can you imagine exploring with the family
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:31.020]   that could help us see Christmas in fresh ways?
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.300]   - Ooh, that's, yeah, that's nice.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:39.700]   I think, first of all, one thing that has always helped me
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.060]   is recognizing just what's immediately around me,
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.260]   not something I have to go purchase or order online.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.260]   What's there that I can sort of help people notice, really?
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.500]   And I was thinking, Christmas is so full of sight,
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   new sights and new sounds and new smells. (laughs)
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.060]   And so I think if they're like Christmas lights,
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.700]   just looking, stringing up a string of lights
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.500]   in an unusual place and turning out the lights
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.860]   and looking at them, talking about that,
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.660]   or lighting a candle.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   Kids love candles, light a candle and just talk about it.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.780]   Or how would you describe it for your words person?
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.660]   What does it look like?
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.020]   What does it feel like?
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.980]   What do you think a candle does?
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.260]   Even eating by candlelight, turning off all the lights,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.780]   seeing what that's like.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.660]   I think exploring, even with your senses,
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:43.540]   I was thinking in our backyard, just the evergreens.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.220]   If you have evergreens in your yard,
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.100]   like holly or pivot hedge, (laughs)
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.140]   we have a lot of weeds in our back field.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.140]   Or even the seed pods that are there.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.820]   Or just going for an evergreen walk.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.620]   What do you see that is still green,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.020]   that smells good like pine, squish it up and smell it?
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.420]   Get them to recognize what's around them
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.700]   and what does this season bring?
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.020]   And you can move that conversation of evergreen things
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.180]   to how God has given these ideas in nature
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.460]   about how his everpresence and how there's ever life
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.540]   through Christ.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.420]   There are just some simple ways like just recognizing
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.820]   what you have in your home that you can just gather
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.100]   and say let's just sit around and think about
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.580]   how does this relate to Christmas?
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.540]   What do you think?
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.540]   And also smells are big because you have spices
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.860]   and you don't have to be a cook.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.980]   You can just sprinkle things around under your water.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.260]   Sprinkle some cinnamon and water, cut up an orange.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.420]   One of the things that you can do is slice oranges
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.580]   and dry 'em in your oven and get it, it smells yummy.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.540]   Or make a cup of cider if you have some apple juice.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.780]   It doesn't have to be fancy but just helping them
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.980]   recognize the sights and the sounds and the smells.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.380]   Just exploring to me is so much about experiencing
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.380]   and remembering that all of this, I just love it.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.980]   You get to introduce it to your kids.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.460]   You get to be that doorkeeper, what do I need to experience?
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.820]   And so if you have a little cook,
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.180]   buy some pre-made sugar cookie dough.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.740]   I mean, I think sometimes we get the illusion
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.180]   we have to (mumbles)
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.260]   but just buy it and have 'em roll it out
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.500]   and get all sticky and gooey and taste it
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   and make those really misshapen cookies.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.820]   (laughs)
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.180]   And just get them to think about things,
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.700]   just helping them recognize what's in front of them
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.860]   and pointing that out.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.820]   I think it brings wonder to me as well.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.820]   I think it makes it more delightful for me
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.660]   as we enter in.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.780]   And also, if you're a musical family,
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.540]   we were not as much musical,
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.540]   but having just different music in the background
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.860]   and recognizing it or listening to parts of,
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.820]   I know one thing Whit and I used to do
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.740]   is listen to parts of the Messiah
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.260]   and thinking about the scripture that goes with it.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.020]   That's a wonderful devotional.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.780]   I just listen to a little two-minute section
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.740]   and then discuss it, it's really lovely.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.020]   So I think all those things,
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.020]   of course you can do all the Christmas tree,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.300]   go out and look at Christmas lights
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.820]   and go to different events.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.540]   Those are things that are exciting too.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.700]   But I think in your home,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.660]   just realizing the things that you have.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.500]   And also honestly, sometimes we put things up
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.180]   and our kids don't even know why.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.020]   - Yes, oh my goodness.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.020]   Explaining your Christmas decorations and tell the story.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:22.460]   I know that, I remember when our older daughter got married,
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.340]   maybe they were just engaged,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.660]   but her guy was coming to,
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.980]   he was gonna decorate the Christmas tree with us.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.580]   And I mean, he said to her, "Well, how long could that take?"
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.420]   And she looked at him a little funny.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.300]   And then he came to the house and I mean, it takes us.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.220]   Hours, multiple hours.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.980]   It takes us a good two hours.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.660]   And I mean, we have a 10 foot tree,
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.660]   but still it's not just putting the ornaments on the tree.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:57.420]   We rehearsed the story because our family had a tradition
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.460]   that everybody got a new ornament every year.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.020]   And so you remember the year that you got this ornament.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.220]   I got this ornament when we went to Disney
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.140]   for the first time.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.100]   And so Sleeping Beauty's slipper is there
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.580]   for one of my daughters.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.660]   And the year that the other daughter
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.100]   was really into photography, she got a camera ornament.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.820]   And so we rehearsed them.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.380]   And there are ornaments on our tree now
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.180]   that were mine when I was a little girl.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.980]   And so when I put them up,
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.380]   I explain why these two ornaments
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.140]   have to hang next to each other.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.580]   Because when I was little,
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.660]   the mouse and the fruit basket had to hang near each other
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.700]   because the mouse ate the fruit at night.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.580]   And so I think Gabe was shocked.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.420]   It's like, okay, wow, I can see why it takes your family
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.100]   so long to do this.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.900]   But that is part of our shared heritage.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.380]   And that's how we keep the memories alive.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.780]   And it was bittersweet when the girls got married
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.380]   because I boxed their ornaments up
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.020]   and they took them with them to their new family.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.740]   And so I love that.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.380]   Talking about the decorations,
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.420]   why do we always put the manger here?
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:24.700]   Why is that nativity special to us?
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.500]   - And that's a good point.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.860]   - Yeah, when did grandma make that kissing ball
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.420]   and what in the world is that?
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.420]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.420]   It's really a time to, like you were saying,
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.500]   reflect on your heritage and your stories.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.420]   We had a mouse on our tree, it was Mary Claire,
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.660]   she's taking it now.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.900]   But the boys always had an owl that had talons
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.660]   and they would always place it over the mouse.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.580]   So it was a little bit different than yours.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.780]   And so Mary Claire sends every year a photograph
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.580]   of her mouse being very safely taken care of by their--
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.020]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.620]   Finally, her mouse does not live with her brothers
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.060]   and he can spend the holidays in relative peace.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.100]   - And I think even, I would just really encourage moms
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.100]   to have a crush that is completely available to you.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.740]   Nothing that, I mean, you can have the lovely crush
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.700]   on the mantle, but I think anything at eye level
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   really should be able to be explored.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.580]   And so get an inexpensive crush that, or a plastic one,
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.460]   or that kids can just act out that story.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.180]   Sometimes Whit would move, when we get to the Magi,
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.100]   he would take the, they'll move around the room
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.460]   so the kids would have to find them in the morning.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.660]   - Oh, that's so fun.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.060]   - Yes, so it's that, it's simple,
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.580]   but it's a little bit intentional of thinking about it
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.420]   and doing it and not making it rushed for yourself.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.220]   And don't overburden yourself
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.660]   with a thousand different new things.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.780]   - Yes, it doesn't have to be scripted.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.700]   You don't have to know all of the answers.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   I can remember reading just the Christmas story
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.700]   to the girls out of very simple Bible storybooks.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.460]   And they had a bajillion questions.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.300]   How far was it that they had to go on the donkey?
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.460]   And so then, of course, we had to go get a map
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.420]   'cause their daddy loves maps, so we had plenty of maps.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:29.420]   And so we plotted how far is it that Mary and Joseph went
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:34.420]   to get to Bethlehem, so they had a donkey.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.860]   Well, what does a donkey eat?
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.540]   So all these questions, it's just ways for little people
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.220]   to explore the Christmas story.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.300]   Now, when we think about the Christmas story,
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.300]   as a grownup, I never think about what did the donkey eat.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.780]   I mean, I just never think about that.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.820]   But if your child does, then chase that rabbit.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.700]   And how far is it to Bethlehem?
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:03.860]   Why were the sheep out in the pasture?
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.660]   Why were the shepherd and the sheep out there,
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.580]   and what would it have looked like?
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.860]   I had one daughter who asked, did they have tents?
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.460]   Well, I mean, not like the tent you have in your backyard.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.380]   Not like the one we take camping.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.180]   So how did they get food, and why were they awake,
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.140]   and just all kinds of things.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.740]   And you can measure things.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.460]   You can find pictures of a manger,
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.180]   because they put maybe Jesus in a manger.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.300]   Like the manger that we have in our house is really small.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.620]   Even a brand new baby would not fit in that thing.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.980]   So what did it look like?
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.980]   If you tell the story slowly and allow your children
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.860]   to ask all of the questions that occur to them,
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.140]   you will find a bajillion things to explore.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.700]   - Yes, and it's because it's a real story.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.100]   It really happened.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.660]   And I think that those questions imply that.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.220]   Like, how far did they have to walk?
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.940]   If this was a pretend story,
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.820]   I don't know that that would matter, but it's a real story.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.820]   And I think that's the best Christmas pageant ever.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.420]   It gives you that kind of idea of people
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.500]   who have never heard the story,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.220]   and take it by faith that it's true.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.060]   Then they do ask those kind of questions.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.500]   Like, why would the magi give them
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.420]   this gold frankincense and myrrh?
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.260]   How about a hand?
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.100]   - Right, right.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.780]   And why would that be a good thing?
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.100]   'Cause that seems like a bogus present for a baby today.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.940]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.660]   - And our kids will just ask these bald questions.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.980]   And that's what I meant about,
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.540]   don't feel like you have to know everything.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.620]   - I think a lot of times, young moms,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.540]   I know I was more intimidated for my children
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.380]   to ask questions when I was a really young mom,
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.460]   because I thought if they had a question,
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.460]   I was supposed to have an answer.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.580]   There was always a one-to-one correspondence there.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.700]   And then, and partly they started asking harder questions
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.540]   as they got older, and so I had fewer
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.940]   and fewer ready-made answers.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.520]   But the real beauty of family exploration
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.380]   is that you look for the answers together.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.180]   And that makes the conversation,
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.300]   and that is actually what makes the memory.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.060]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.420]   And I think being excited with your child,
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.420]   like, hey, that was a good question.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.160]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.700]   Let's see if we can figure it out.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.060]   I think, like you were saying earlier,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.980]   affirming their curiosity instead of going,
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.980]   oh, let's, I don't know.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.480]   I can see my eyes getting impatient
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.040]   instead of just pausing and listening
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.900]   and giving and recognizing,
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.160]   hey, that's a pretty good question.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.240]   Let's see if we can figure out the answer to it.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.040]   Or I just don't, mommy doesn't know right now.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.480]   Maybe we can look later.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.200]   You know, I think that's just your modeling for them.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.160]   - Yes, and so often, as adults,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.200]   we are totally invested in answers.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.200]   But children are totally invested in exploring
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.700]   but also in relationships.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.420]   They just want to be with you.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.280]   And like you said, Amy, so beautifully,
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.680]   they will, it resonates with them when you say,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.500]   that was a really good question.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.920]   Or that is so interesting.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.520]   Or I always wondered about that too.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.580]   Or I never thought of that.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.500]   And you have built a bridge with your child.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.920]   There's so many things you can explore.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   So what did the nighttime sky look like
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.220]   at the time that Jesus was born?
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.620]   Was there a star?
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.340]   And lots of us have planetariums, at least sort of close by.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.900]   And we can go, and many planetariums have
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.820]   Star of Bethlehem programs
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.100]   or the Night Sky of Bethlehem kind of programs.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.820]   But you can look up things.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.700]   Now there is the internet, which there was not
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.720]   when my kids were really, really little.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.460]   But you can find answers to all kinds of questions.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.500]   But the fun might be in bundling up
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.580]   and taking your blanket outside at night
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.700]   and doing something that your children would think
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.280]   you would never do.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.620]   I can remember doing bizarre things with my kids
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.700]   and them looking at me and saying,
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.380]   you're gonna let us do that?
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.900]   - Yes. - And it was so exciting
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.840]   that they were doing this clandestine thing.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.140]   But that we were doing it together is the kind of memory
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.020]   that sticks with our children forever.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.820]   Well, this has been so awesome.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.020]   I wanna ask you, 'cause we've talked about
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.180]   a lot of ways of exploring and why it's so good
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.940]   to explore with our children.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.660]   How, Amy, can exploring the Christmas story together
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.440]   bring our hearts together at Christmas time as a family?
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.220]   - Well, we have a common savior.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:21.820]   And on some level, we're all,
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.100]   before God, we are all the same in that sense.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.940]   So sharing the Christmas story, we all share in that joy.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.760]   This is not a fairy tale.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.500]   That I'm telling you to give you this new story
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   to put in your library of your mind.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.420]   But this is a real story.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   And this story continues on, it will continue for eternity.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:51.820]   We will be reminiscing about this story for eternity.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.160]   This is an eternal word.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   And so I think, I keep thinking of the verse in Hebrews
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.980]   as living and active.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.520]   So I think for us, as we sit before the word of God,
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.180]   and we read the story, and we think about the story,
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:14.180]   and allow it, allow the Lord to really minister to us
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.620]   to think of how redemptive the story is,
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.360]   what it speaks about the nature of God and Christ.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.460]   And so I think for all of us,
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.580]   as we're sharing the story with our children,
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.580]   we all enter into the place before God and His word.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.380]   And so I think that's a really powerful place
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.860]   to allow us to be ministered to by the story,
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.780]   as well as our children.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.820]   We're not just laying information.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.820]   We're all sitting before this living word.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.820]   And also just remembering what the parts mean.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.860]   My grandchildren are memorizing Luke two.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.740]   And they've just asked such good questions.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.160]   And by slowing that down, just to recognize
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.380]   what all the little parts of the story
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.800]   and how the Lord just put it together.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.660]   So I think as we retell the story over and over,
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.540]   act out the story, discuss the story,
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.120]   poke and prod at the story,
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:23.120]   I think together that unifies us as believers.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.860]   And it helps us see the heritage
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.700]   that we have in our Christian faith.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.820]   It reinforces that of the other truths,
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.620]   that as Christ walked on earth,
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.460]   His crucifixion, His resurrection,
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.300]   it just is part of that whole story.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.260]   And so I think for us,
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:48.180]   that is just something lovely about sitting before it
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.740]   as an agreeing with it
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.740]   and seeing how it continues to affect our life today.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.660]   It's not just something in the past.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.260]   It's something that currently works in our hearts and minds.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.340]   So I think that's pretty powerful for us.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.500]   And then of course,
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.900]   exploring that with other people in our community,
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.380]   bringing people into your home.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.860]   And just your neighbor,
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.820]   we went caroling and we sound terrible.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.660]   We are not.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.540]   - It's a joyful noise, Amy.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.020]   - It's a joyful noise.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.940]   A five-year-old had a harmonica that he played.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.300]   - Oh, wow.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.500]   - But it was delightful
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.060]   because we just have a few neighbors that we know
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.660]   that live alone.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.380]   And that was just really easy.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.300]   And I think a way of extending yourself
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.420]   in simple ways to community,
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.700]   invite someone over or take them a cup of tea,
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:48.060]   have your kids do things that make a gift.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.020]   I mean, it's not hard to do that
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.460]   just to slather a pine cone with some peanut butter
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.540]   and take it next door.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:01.060]   I think we as believers have such a beautiful gift
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.820]   and I think we can extend that gift too
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.980]   in a natural way and helping children recognize
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.580]   that that's part of the Christmas story too.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.780]   Jesus gave all sorts of people.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.740]   And so to look for opportunities,
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.420]   again, to minister and to share that,
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.940]   what we've come, as we've explored,
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.020]   to share that joy with other people
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.660]   is really powerful as well.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.740]   - Yes, it is.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.660]   That is, that's beautiful.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.220]   And such so many good ideas,
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.060]   families, for exploring together.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:40.700]   Simplifying Advent by exploring
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.060]   might really lead your family to experience
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.100]   the Christmas story in a new, a fresh,
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.540]   a deeper way this season.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.900]   And we will be glad to have been part of that.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.460]   Amy, thank you so much for talking to me
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.900]   and sharing some of these great ideas with our families.

[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.540]   might be a trip to Great Wolf Lodge.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.020]   There are locations right all around the country.

[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.260]   They have suite-style rooms, in-house dining.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.980]   There are water parks.

[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.660]   that your family can enjoy there together.
