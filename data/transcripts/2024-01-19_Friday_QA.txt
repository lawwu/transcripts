[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance is live Q&A.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.600]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.040]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.540]   My name is Joshua Sheath, today is Friday, January 19, 2024.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.320]   And on this Friday, as we do each Friday, in which I can arrange the appropriate recording
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.880]   and broadcasting technology, we record a live Q&A.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.280]   You call in, talk about anything you want.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:53.920]   If you've been listening to these shows, looking for a chance to talk to me, bring up your
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.740]   topic of conversation, bring up any questions that you have, I'd love for you to do that.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.240]   You can do that by becoming a patron of the show.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.800]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, sign up
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.160]   to support the show there on Patreon, that'll gain you access to one of these Friday Q&A
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.160]   shows.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.160]   Friday Q&A calls, that gives me the ability to meter the calls a little bit, just make
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.960]   sure I don't have too many calls.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800]   By the way, if those of you who want to talk to me, this is probably your cheapest way
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800]   to do that.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.360]   I've had people, of course, I want you to stay around for years and years as a patron,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.900]   I've had people sign up, sign up for one month, talk to me on Q&A calls each week for a month
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.420]   or something like that, and then they're done and they're out of here.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.540]   Also remember though, so if you'd like to talk to me, that's a fair way to do it.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.860]   However, also remember that right now, consulting calls are open during the month of January.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.260]   If you'd like to book a private consultation with me, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.420]   probably one of the most competent, most discreet financial advisors that you can talk to.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.260]   I don't have any conflicts of interest, don't sell any products, I'm just simply here to
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.460]   talk to you about anything that you want.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.340]   You can judge by the way that I handle these Q&A calls and see if you think it might be
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.340]   useful.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.780]   But if you think I might be able to serve you, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.780]   We begin with Andrew in Minnesota.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.780]   Andrew, welcome to the show.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.780]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.780]   Andrew Hiltzik, CFO Alphabet and Google: Yeah, good afternoon, Josh.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:20.140]   I just want to first off say thanks and appreciate the opportunity to do this on a regular basis.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.180]   My question is to just get general advice.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.980]   I'm interested to start my own podcast around building wealth and investing specifically
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.500]   in a niche to build mid-six-figure to mid-seven-figure wealth.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.540]   Or I want to be mindful to Christians with respect to tithing, generosity in general,
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.940]   biblical financial advice.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.580]   And I'm just curious if you have any recommendations on how to build a brand around that concept
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.860]   that would eventually generate income over months to years that I could potentially live
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.860]   off of.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.980]   You said podcast.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.540]   Do you mean audio podcast or do you mean video podcast?
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.740]   Either/both.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.620]   I would assume just to get...
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.620]   I'm not a content creator by any way currently.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.340]   So I think I'd get started generally doing audio, but I'm definitely open to video and
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.300]   even just a common webcam videotaping the conversation.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   Right.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.900]   So let me begin with that.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.180]   I would say that the era of audio-only podcasting is basically behind us.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.780]   And so if I were starting over today, even as I think about with my own stuff, I would
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.540]   never again start an audio-only podcast.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.740]   And let me explain why that is so you can see if I'm right or wrong.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.020]   Because there are many audio podcasts.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.420]   Many people listen to audio podcasts.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.940]   But audio podcasts face some significant challenges that other forms of media do not.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.340]   The first problem that you face with audio podcasts is the problem of findability.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.440]   Now if somebody wants to go and look for an audio podcast, there is no problem of findability.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.980]   You can go to Apple Podcasts, you can go to Stitcher, you can go to Spotify.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.040]   You can go wherever you want.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.000]   You can find podcasts.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.740]   But that's only serving the people who are going and looking for those audio podcasts.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.460]   And so those people can go and find an audio podcast.
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.740]   And that's great.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.400]   But once they find it, they can't really share it.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.140]   And this is the first big problem with audio-only podcasting.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.580]   Audio-only podcasts are not shareable.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.840]   And thus they basically never go viral.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.020]   A show can sort of kind of go viral.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.520]   Although I haven't heard of an audio podcast going viral in years, there are certainly
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   many large audio podcasts.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.200]   But a podcast itself, like a specific episode of a podcast cannot go viral because there's
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.140]   no easy way to share it.
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.580]   There's no easy way to share a clip from it.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.760]   There's no functional way that it can go.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.300]   So you might have a show of mine that you really enjoy.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.480]   And so you'll send an episode to a friend and that friend may click on a link and listen
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   to the episode.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.800]   I do that occasionally when someone sends me a link.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.440]   But they can often listen without subscribing.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.380]   And the listening is often buried in a long format of show.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.400]   I of course produce a long format podcast and my listeners that are here for the long
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.000]   format, they like that.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.720]   I like the medium.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.840]   It fits what I like to do.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.120]   But in general it means that it's very hard for people to find the content.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.040]   And a specific podcast episode or a specific audio podcast only moment never goes viral.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.840]   Let's pretend that the problem of shareability was instantly solved.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.760]   Let's pretend that you recorded a podcast and you had somehow some custom software that
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.480]   could take a perfect three minute clip from an audio podcast.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.240]   And so anytime somebody wanted to share that clip of some profound thought that you've
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.000]   had with your audio podcast and they wanted to share that with all their friends on social
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.360]   media and they click that, you're still left with just audio.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.440]   And unless there's some kind of automated transcription service that's transcribing
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.260]   it and putting words on it, it's such a boring video and you've all lost all of our attention
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.220]   span that nobody's going to sit there and pay attention to a three minute audio only
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.220]   clip.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.900]   And so you don't even have something that can go viral the way that a three minute video
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.340]   clip from a show or something like that could go viral because there's nothing interesting
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.360]   to see.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.620]   And so when your listeners are sitting there scrolling and swiping while they're sitting
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.980]   on the bus or whatever, then they're not likely to sit there for long enough to listen to
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.620]   your audio, especially in a TikTok generation where now our attention spans are even shorter.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.040]   Now the second big problem with podcasts is that there's no algorithm to feed your content
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.420]   to someone else.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:12.780]   So if you have an audio only podcast that is positioned on a traditional audio only
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.660]   platform and somebody listens to your episode, there's no algorithm that's going to pitch
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.520]   them the next episode.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.420]   There's no algorithm that's going to say, "Hey, have you checked this out?"
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.840]   Now compare and contrast that with YouTube.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.900]   If I go to YouTube and I search for something, I'll get a lot of interesting search results
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.220]   and I'll find a video and I'll watch two or three videos.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.380]   Then the next day when I'm flipping through my YouTube feed, all of a sudden YouTube pitches
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.940]   me a video on the thing that I watched yesterday.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.300]   And I say, "Oh, that's cool."
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.300]   And if I watch one person's video, then all of a sudden now it'll pitch me another person's
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.360]   that video.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.080]   And many of the channels or things that I consume on an ongoing basis are things that
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:08:00.380]   I consume based upon the fact that they were recommended to me by the algorithm.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.420]   And so that recommendation engine of the algorithm is really, really a valuable thing about the
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.740]   video platforms and it doesn't exist on any of the audio platforms.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:18.980]   So the third thing that has happened is with the absolute collapse of the price of bandwidth
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:25.440]   that most of us basically have enough data that we don't much care whether we're listening
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.140]   to audio or we're watching video.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:33.360]   So when I started Radical Personal Finance in 2013, it was a very pivotal moment in the
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.080]   technology of audio podcasting because we had gone past the stage at which you had to
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.280]   take your iPod, plug it into your computer and upload all your podcasts that you downloaded
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   from iTunes.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.220]   That was where I started listening to audio podcasting.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.980]   Some people were before that, but that's where I ended in.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:54.340]   It was past that stage, but we weren't yet to the stage where bandwidth was cheap.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.880]   We were at the smartphone revolution where people didn't have to deal with iTunes and
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   plugging their iPod and MP3 players into the computer, but we hadn't yet reached absolute
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.640]   zero cost bandwidth.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.320]   And so audio podcasts were very attractive because you could download all kinds of podcasts,
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.400]   have them all ready for you and you could, while you're driving around, easily listen
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.520]   to those things.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.960]   And that was where the mega podcast listeners kind of started and came from.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.160]   That's dead and gone.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.080]   I don't do that anymore and I'm a podcast creator.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.760]   I do not today listen to any audio only podcasts and the audio podcasts that I do listen to,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.880]   I usually stream them on something like YouTube because it's more convenient for me to have
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.280]   it there than it is for me to use podcast players.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.360]   And actually that's not true.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.560]   Excuse me, there is one podcast that I do listen to that is an audio podcast that's
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.760]   not on YouTube.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.800]   But beyond that, the whole world of kind of audio podcast listening has dramatically decreased.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.040]   Now what has increased is video.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:06.720]   So video is absolutely enormous and video in all of its formats, long form video, two
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   hour video, two second video, all of video, we are living in the day and age of video.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.360]   Now let me pivot for just a moment to writing.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.720]   Writing is not dead and gone.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.500]   Writing is still extremely powerful and extremely useful.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.520]   But the methods of writing have changed and writing has the great benefit of being scannable
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.740]   and having the ability to go viral in an appropriate forum.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:39.040]   And so as I see it, the future is for strong writers and for strong video creators to really
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.680]   flourish in the future.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.760]   Now that doesn't mean that you can't have an audio only podcast because there is still
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.440]   a great contingent of people that may want to listen to your content because it is convenient
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.440]   for them.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.640]   They might not live in a place where they have great connectivity, etc.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.320]   And so those people, creating an audio podcast feed is certainly something that should be
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:09.960]   done but I would not recommend it as a primary platform for almost anybody in today's age.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.680]   Now here is one comment however where I would say it is worth considering.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.660]   If creating the audio podcast is something that is useful for you personally as a way
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:28.440]   to articulate your thoughts and to force you and if it is the simple first step to going
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.920]   from being a consumer to being a producer, then you should do that.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.900]   But you should as quickly as possible add in other forms of content that have the opportunity
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.940]   to go viral, to be shared more easily in a compact, concise way and also that have the
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:49.040]   opportunity to get algorithms working on your side sharing your content in some way, shape,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   or form.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.960]   And audio podcasts as I see it suffer enormously from those two major problems in today's world.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.040]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.800]   Okay, good advice.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:10.760]   When would you find it appropriate to spend money on advertising on any social media advertising
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.320]   platform spending a few hundred dollars a month there to try to kickstart that going
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.840]   viral or searchability?
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.520]   When you have some saleable product where you can profit from it.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.960]   So for the business model to work, you have to have some kind of product that you can
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.360]   sell and if you have that, then go ahead and start spending money on ads.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.440]   Okay, sounds good.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.680]   Okay, thank you very much.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   My pleasure.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.640]   And feel free to call back and we can go over more steps but I feel strongly about that.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.520]   The era of audio only podcasting, the great rise in it, it's still there just like radio
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.320]   is still there but it's not where the excitement is, it's not where the masses are and I believe
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   that it suffers from those two enormous flaws.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.320]   Peter in New York, welcome to the show.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   How can I serve you today?
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   Hey Joshua, can I ask you some questions about cash management both strategic and tactical?
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   Yes.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.880]   All right.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.200]   My portfolio has gotten a little out of whack and I'm happy to go into that but I wanted
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:27.640]   to first strategically try to figure out if my stock to cash balance should also include
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.840]   my real estate holdings or not and then I had some specific tactical questions about
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.960]   getting the stock portion or the cash portion of my portfolio built back up.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.880]   What is your target percentage and allocation towards cash?
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.600]   So with investable money, I'm interested in 90% mutual funds and 10% cash.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.360]   And how much total cash does that represent in terms of your portfolio?
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.760]   So it depends on whether the real estate's in there or not.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.800]   That's what I'm trying to figure out first which is my network when you throw in the
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:10.040]   real estate is like double what it is if you just looked at the investable assets.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:17.760]   So I'm trying to figure out what my cash number should be if it should include the total number
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.360]   with the real estate or not.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.200]   What's the net worth with real estate and what's the net worth without real estate?
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:33.680]   With real estate it's about 5 million and without the real estate it's about 2 million.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.040]   And how did you come up with a 10% target?
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.160]   What's the logic behind that target?
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:46.000]   I just picked, Warren Buffet always said 90% S&P index and 10% short term treasuries.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.760]   So I said that sounds like a good mix to me.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.200]   And currently is the money in treasuries?
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.880]   So currently my cash position's gotten a little bit whacked.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:05.160]   The biggest chunk of it is in a high yield savings account.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.840]   And then the next biggest tranche is the cash balance of the whole life insurance policy
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.780]   and then after that is in a checking account.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:21.960]   Why did Warren Buffet say 10% treasuries, 90% mutual funds?
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.160]   I think the idea always was just to have some cash on the sideline for interesting opportunities
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   that come around.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.760]   I always had the sense it was for dry powder purposes.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.440]   So I'm fine with it.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.840]   We just always have to ask that question.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.120]   Why are we doing this?
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.640]   And so I have some thoughts and I have a framework but before I give that to you, what specifically
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.440]   is your first question then?
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.760]   So my real question is I've gotten out of whack because I simultaneously had a large
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.740]   inheritance tax bill, which is how the real estate portion of the portfolio got really
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:05.440]   big all of a sudden, and I had a car that I came off of a lease that I bought.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.920]   So I simultaneously had a huge tax bill and a huge car loan bill and all of my usual sort
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.560]   of emergency fund cash that I had went to that.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.760]   I've been doing a little 0% credit card games and have a whole life insurance loan that
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.200]   I'm paying back.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.280]   And I'm trying to, you know, the credit card game is sort of easy to do the three card
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.040]   Monty.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.200]   The real question I had is with the whole life insurance loan, how beneficial it is
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:40.080]   to drag that out versus paying it down, you know, give it that it's even though I'm paying
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.240]   myself back as my highest interest debt right now.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.880]   That's really the tactical question I have.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.420]   But also I was trying to figure out do I, does the number that I'm shooting for need
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.760]   to reflect the fact that I've got these big real estate holdings or can it just, you know,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.000]   print out what's in the 401k and everything else that's invested.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.240]   I don't know of a way that we could answer that cat, that last question categorically
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.440]   until we project a few scenarios.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:18.920]   And so there's, when you think about your cash holdings, then you want to say, well,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.280]   what are, what are my targets?
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   What are my scenarios?
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.320]   That's why I pressed on the 10% number.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.120]   You could imagine, for example, let me, let me just set out a couple of scenarios to try
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.480]   to prove the point.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:37.240]   Let's say that somebody has a $10,000 net worth and so he's trying to take Warren Buffett's
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:45.200]   advice and he's trying to keep $9,000 invested in mutual funds and $1,000 in cash.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.160]   Well that's obviously dumb, right?
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.880]   Somebody with a $10,000 net worth should have all $10,000 in cash because you're going to
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.120]   need that money to move apartments and put down first, last and security.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.160]   You're going to need that money to fix the car when it breaks.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.280]   When you have $10,000 net worth, the 10/90 rule doesn't make any sense because it needs
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.640]   to be a hundred percent cash and zero percent mutual funds at that level of net worth.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:15.920]   Now if somebody's got a hundred bazillion dollars and they're trying to keep 90% in
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:33.560]   mutual funds, so somebody's got a hundred bazillion dollars and they're trying to keep
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:41.880]   90% in mutual funds and their 10% means that they've got $58 million sitting in cash and
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.960]   they have no intention of buying a business or anything like that, then what's the point
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.920]   of having $58 million sitting in cash?
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:54.000]   Now you could understand Warren Buffett giving that advice about kind of a dry powder target
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.840]   but I don't think it's very helpful for us to begin there.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.640]   I think we need to begin first by saying what are some reasons we might want to have cash
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.080]   and then target those reasons.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.360]   So the example, this is where we get into kind of day-to-day normal stuff, three to
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.480]   six months worth of expenses in cash.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480]   Why?
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   Well we might lose our job.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.960]   If we lose our job we don't want to be in a difficult situation, we want to be able
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.000]   to get a good next job, we want to make sure we have money so if we have six months of
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.120]   expenses, that six months of wiggle room, I think I could probably get a job fairly
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.200]   quickly within that, especially if I'm fairly employable.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.800]   Now let's say that instead of being fairly employable you have a job where you have a
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.680]   very unique skill set and maybe you can make a lot of money when you're working but it's
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.920]   not uncommon at all for you to have say eight months without a contract or ten months without
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.000]   a contract.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.640]   Well now in that situation we would immediately go and say I need to have a year's worth of
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:20:00.040]   emergency fund, a year's worth of expenses because I might go a year without having income.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.340]   So now the goal is a year.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.960]   Now if someone has real estate then let's say we want to look at it and we say what
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   could likely happen.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:14.440]   Well the worst scenario that might happen is I would have a hurricane with a bad tornado
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:20.240]   spawned from it that rolls across all four of my rental houses at the same exact time
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.540]   destroying all four of them.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.880]   Well I have insurance policies, my deductibles on each property are $25,000 and so if I have
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.160]   $100,000 in cash then that covers my deductibles on four properties.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.460]   It's probably more extreme than I need to think about but that's kind of a starting
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.920]   point because now we're putting a name on the cash and we're giving it a job to do and
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.680]   now we understand how much we might want to have.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.160]   Similarly in the real estate space if we're looking at it and we recognize you know what
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.000]   from time to time I have a two month vacancy I need to make sure that I'm always prepared
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.560]   to have money for a two month vacancy and I need to make sure that my average turnaround
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.120]   on a house when someone moves out and kind of fixing it up is say $4,000 so I need enough
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.960]   money to cover my expenses for mortgage expenses and other stuff for a two month vacancy on
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:12.400]   average plus $4,000 turnarounds plus 50% of a roof or something like that.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.760]   And so the only way we can arrive at the appropriate amount of cash to have on hand is based upon
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.960]   the kinds of scenarios that we would envision needing that money for.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   And then that's actually what funds a lot of kind of what I say about where and how
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.300]   cash should be stored.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.300]   So I tell people they should start their cash savings by having a certain amount of money
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.060]   that they have at home.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.520]   And so why do I say that?
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   Physical currency.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.680]   Well how do you figure out what amount of physical currency you should have?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.360]   Well you make up a scenario.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.460]   So my scenario is you know all of a sudden they pass some law against homeschooling or
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.860]   something like that and it's going to be retroactive and I've got to flee the country so they don't
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.500]   put my children in prison.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:00.140]   And so I need to make sure that I have $10,000 of cash to go down to the airport and buy
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.600]   plane tickets out of the country so they don't arrest me and my children.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.180]   And I need to make sure that I have enough money to flee and have three months of expenses
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.820]   in a foreign area, foreign land.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.420]   So maybe if I have $20,000 in currency that allows me to go and get on an airplane and
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.500]   start over somewhere else.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.960]   You know I'm using kind of a goofy but real scenario.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.160]   Or you might look and say if everything went bad and I lost everything I had at least I
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.380]   have three months of expenses and so I want to have that in physical currency.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.700]   Or you look at how much money do you keep in a bank account in another country.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.380]   Well my answer is something like two years worth of living expenses.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.380]   That's a target.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.380]   Why?
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.340]   Well maybe my home currency is collapsing and I have to move abroad because there's
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.820]   hyperinflation where I'm from and I need two years to kind of figure things out so I keep
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.700]   two years worth of living expenses abroad and I invest everything else etc.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.740]   So I've given enough examples now but that's the way that you figure out how much cash
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.020]   you need.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:02.340]   And a guy with $100 million doesn't need $10 million of cash just because of a 90/10 rule
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.980]   and a guy with $10,000 doesn't need $1,000 of cash just because of a 90/10 rule.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:14.320]   There needs to be a name that's put on it based upon probable potential life circumstances
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.460]   that may happen and how you might use cash to negotiate those circumstances.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.940]   Got it.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.300]   Got it.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:29.100]   I've always sort of done the standard three to six months reserve has always been my usual
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.460]   just to cover living expenses on the odd chance that nobody's working for a little while.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.660]   And I think that's reasonable.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.980]   Beyond that, yeah, beyond that I've never really targeted for anything other than that.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.140]   I mean occasionally it's nice to have some if there's some dip in the market or something
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.060]   like that but really that's all I've ever earmarked it for.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:53.220]   And so I didn't give trading examples but a trader will go through a similar thought
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.220]   process.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.540]   You know I never commit more than let's say you had some rules.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.420]   Let's say you said I'm never going to commit more than 10% of my net worth to a position
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.780]   and I always want to have enough money to be able to take advantage of a really great
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.140]   buying opportunity when it's there.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.500]   I want to have that dry powder.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.460]   So then that person might say I'm going to always keep 10% of my net worth in cash so
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.180]   that I have the ability to jump on something when I see it or whatever other logic works
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.100]   based upon your particular strategy.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:27.660]   My point is it's fine to accept a rule of thumb.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.900]   You routinely hear me use rules of thumb because rules of thumb work.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:38.200]   If somebody has six months of expenses and that fits if somebody always has an emergency
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:45.700]   fund that covers three to six months of expenses by definition that amount of money will scale
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.740]   to somebody's lifestyle.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:55.780]   And so people who live a lifestyle of say $3,000 a month they don't have $30,000 emergencies.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.320]   They just don't because everything in their life is scaled to their expenses.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.040]   On the other hand a guy who lives a lifestyle of $15,000 a month it wouldn't be uncommon
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.940]   for him to have a $30,000 emergency.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:14.920]   It's just a different expression of emergency because our financial transactions are always
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.580]   scaled to our normal life.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:22.920]   So the rule of thumb is perfectly fine to use because it kind of automatically fits
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.520]   most of those circumstances.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.820]   You wanted to buy out a lease on a car you're the kind of guy who has six months of expenses
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.420]   for you buying a lease on a car.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.780]   I don't know what you paid but let's just say $40,000 to buy out your lease.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.220]   Okay done great this was no problem because that's the scale of your financial life.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:47.380]   So I don't want to keep you too much longer on the whole life loan just from a practical
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:54.540]   standpoint is it beneficial to drag out paying that out for however the policy and no okay
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.140]   so it doesn't matter how I do that.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:04.500]   It gets paid off when it's paid off and neither here nor there on the rate of doing it.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:10.300]   Right so my answer to you was the first thing we look at is do we need the cash right now
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.820]   or are we simply kind of rebuilding the supplies.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.380]   If we're rebuilding our reserves then my first answer and I'll just give it to you we don't
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.300]   need to go through it in a question and answer way is you start by funneling extra amounts
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.860]   from your income towards just simply building cash again.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.940]   So for a guy like you who's wealthy who could sell property for a guy like you who has the
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.380]   ability to open up your stock account sell $100,000 and have it covered immediately.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.900]   I don't think you need to freak out and start selling property unnecessarily.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.860]   You don't need to start incurring taxable gains unnecessarily.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.420]   You just want to go ahead and say hey I spent down a lot of cash let's rebuild up the reserves
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.980]   and the ideal way to build up reserves is to simply build them up from income.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:59.660]   And so you want to of course make sure that you maximize qualified account contributions
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.220]   because as the calendar year passes you'll lose the ability to make those contributions
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:10.500]   but after you've maximized 401ks, HSAs, etc. whatever your qualified accounts or otherwise
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:16.140]   you're using then just stop additional investing unless there's a really great deal and you're
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.620]   just buying bargain shares of something.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.700]   Stop additional investing and start rebuilding cash just from income flows and then that
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.780]   in and of itself should handle it.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.620]   The first thing I would pay off would be the life insurance loan and the reason is that
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:36.580]   if you're successfully surfing your 0% balances and I'm assuming maybe you took my credit
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.460]   card course or at least you're familiar with the concepts I taught in that is that if you're
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.700]   successfully surfing those balances and they're small balances let's say it's 20% of your
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.980]   total credit line then those are pretty cheap balances and anytime you need to you can always
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.740]   just take out another life insurance loan and pay them down if you need to.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.940]   But so I would rather go ahead and pay down the life insurance loan first, pay off that
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:06.820]   interest, surf the balances using the 3% or 5% offers if necessary while just simply paying
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.100]   them down out of cash flows.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:14.500]   And then if something happens and let's say that they reduce your credit limits or credit
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.860]   score goes down or something like that then what you do is just go ahead and take out
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:24.020]   another policy loan against the cash values, use that to pay down the credit card balances
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.860]   until you get a more advantageous offer and then switch back.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.540]   So you kind of go back and forth.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:34.660]   But there's no reason to want to maintain a life insurance policy loan on your policy.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.860]   There's no benefit to maintaining it.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.620]   The only reason to have it is if it was useful for you to do something else but once you've
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.780]   used it you want to take it out, put it back, pay it down and get the policy restored back
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.140]   to full operating condition by not having a loan on it.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.140]   Got it.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.140]   All right.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.140]   Thank you.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.140]   Great.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.140]   My pleasure.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.140]   All right.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.140]   We move on to the state of Washington.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.140]   Welcome to the show.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.140]   How can I serve you today?
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.140]   Is that me?
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   Can you hear me?
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.140]   That's you.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.140]   Whoever you is.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.140]   Yep.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.140]   Oh cool.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.140]   My name is Kevin.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:15.300]   I had a, I guess a technical question like a short story as building a house this year
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:21.180]   and I was trying to think of ways that I could generate additional cash flow from possibly
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:28.180]   my taxable investment account or turning off 401k contributions or even HELOC on the current
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.060]   property which is going to be sold at the end, stuff like that.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.380]   Because I'm going to have to be paying interest only payments on the loan as the stuff progresses
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.900]   throughout the year as it gets built.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.180]   How much money do you need?
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.620]   Very unknown at the moment.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.620]   Very unknown.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:52.260]   The first check I wrote was 6,500 bucks and I'm sure that's going to get bigger and quicker.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.260]   Are you borrowing money?
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.100]   Do you have a construction loan for the construction?
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.300]   Yes.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:03.780]   We will have a construction loan but just try to cash flow it if I can, as much as I
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.780]   can.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   All right.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.100]   Well let me give you two models to think about, two just frameworks to put in your thinking.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.340]   I think that if these models are accurate then you'll be able to answer all of the day-to-day
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.460]   questions.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.700]   So let's begin with model number one.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:26.620]   Model number one is if you want to have the lowest possible cost to the construction then
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.460]   you should not borrow money for it.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:36.740]   Anytime we do anything with borrowed money we spend more money because psychologically
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.260]   it's just easy to spend money.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.540]   Maybe it's just me but at least that's always been my experience.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:50.220]   If you actually have to watch your dollars leave your bank account you take much better
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.980]   care of those dollars than if those dollars leaving your bank account are there because
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:31:00.940]   of your construction loan than if those dollars are there because of your credit card or whatever
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.340]   the SBA loan, etc.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:09.260]   New business people who go and borrow money to start their business waste money left,
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.540]   right, and center in a way that you don't when it's actually your money that you saved.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:22.780]   And so if you came to me and you said I am going to pay cash for everything and because
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:28.140]   of that I'm going to stop contributing to my 401k, I'm going to stop saving anything,
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.140]   etc.
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.140]   I'm just paying cash.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:36.660]   I think that's a perfectly reasonable and even advisable plan because of those psychological
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.660]   effects.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:42.820]   You'll make generally speaking better decisions, you'll spend less money, your overall cost
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.580]   to create the house that you want will be lower.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.500]   Now does that mean that you have to do it debt free?
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.420]   It doesn't sound like that's even a choice that you're making but I would say no because
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.820]   there may be certain things that are just set.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.700]   So for example you have to borrow money to buy the land or you have to borrow money to
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.060]   get the shell built out and that's going to cost you X number of dollars and I'm definitely
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.680]   going to borrow money for that.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:16.420]   So that's okay and it's fine to do half and half but if you did something like say I paid
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:21.460]   cash for the land, I have to borrow money to get the house shell built so that it's
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:26.300]   dried in and everything but everything after that I'm going to pay cash and do it myself
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.140]   little by little even if it takes you a couple years to do that etc.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.900]   Because of those behavioral changes I think that's often a perfectly fine thing to do
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.340]   and a smart thing to do.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.660]   And so it's fine to stop saving and investing, it's fine to do that stuff.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.500]   Now if you're, that's framework number one and I think for most people you're better
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.940]   off just to do that.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:55.780]   I don't think almost anyone would regret not contributing to their 401k for a couple of
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:02.020]   years if that allowed them to have a lower balance at the end, to know that they had
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:08.260]   squeezed every penny as much as possible so that they bought the right things and also
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.300]   to make sure that they had enough money to comfortably buy the things that make the house
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.100]   really nice to have.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.180]   Because the opposite argument for what I've described is that sometimes people pinch their
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:24.620]   pennies so hard when they're building a new house that they wind up not creating the house
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.740]   to the level that they really want.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.340]   And so they buy all the cheap fixtures and eight years in everything's rusted and you're
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.340]   pulling it all out.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.580]   It would have been better if you just increased your budget 30% and bought the nice fixtures
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:40.460]   that would have lasted for a longer period of time and helped the house as well.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.860]   And so if debt is one way you do that or just not saving is one way you do that, that's
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.260]   a reasonable choice.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:52.620]   Now beyond that when we get to the topic of should I stop putting money in my 401k or
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.260]   should I cash flow from my stocks, those are two separate questions, let me deal with those
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.300]   separately.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.380]   If you don't contribute to your 401k, you lose your 401k contribution for the year once
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.300]   the calendar year is finished.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.740]   And so if that's an important component of your long-term wealth building plan, as it
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:15.660]   is for most people, recognize that every calendar year that passes that you don't max your accounts
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.260]   is a calendar year that you won't be able to contribute.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.340]   It doesn't mean you can't still invest later, it doesn't mean you can't still get rich,
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.900]   but it's a calendar year that you won't be able to contribute.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.460]   And so if you want that contribution, then you've got to do that, which would lead us
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:35.100]   to say if you have taxable investments, yeah, you should sell them, etc.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.980]   Now moving to the other thing that you alluded to, should I divert my cash flow from my taxable
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:40.980]   accounts?
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.300]   Sure, you should divert all cash flow.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.580]   Wherever it comes in, any cash flow should be treated the same and it should go to your
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.060]   highest financial priority, which is to build this house.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.860]   If you have to sell investments, then it's more a matter of tax planning the future of
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:02.300]   the investment and would I rather kind of pay for the things that I'm buying or would
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.660]   I rather not pay for the things that I'm buying.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.660]   But in general, I believe that for most people, the first principle that I described is going
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.300]   to be your most important one.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.780]   You'll make better decisions, you'll be more careful, more thoughtful, and you'll feel
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.260]   better at the end when you're dealing with your money for stuff rather than overspending
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.780]   by 82% because you did it all with debt.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:28.540]   Yeah, it's pretty much everything I thought through on my own as well.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:34.460]   But buying the land and everything else, all my cash is gone effectively.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:40.940]   So the other thing you pointed out was good.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.300]   So you got to get more cash and obviously that's what you're saying, but that's going
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.860]   to come from either selling some of your investments to free up cash or it's going to come from
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.260]   making more money or it's just going to come from waiting until you can save more money.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:58.700]   And so you take a look at the situation and figure out what makes sense for you.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.140]   But those are the frameworks that I think will answer your questions.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.140]   Good enough?
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.140]   Yeah, cool.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.140]   Thank you.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.140]   My pleasure.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.140]   All right, move to David in Texas.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.140]   David, welcome to the show.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.140]   How can I serve you today?
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.140]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.060]   This is a "What would Joshua do?"
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.740]   type of question.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.740]   WWJD, baby.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.740]   And so, yeah, exactly.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:26.460]   And we've spoken in the past in the consulting, so you might remember some of my intricacies.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:35.980]   But anyway, I have a full-time technical W2 job and then I also have a side business that
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.700]   probably around half of my full-time W2 job.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:52.380]   The company that just offered me this new job, and the job I was working was about to
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.820]   get shut down for the project.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:59.980]   So this new job offered me to move actually closer to family.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.300]   It's about an hour closer.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.500]   We live out in the country where I would call ourselves prepared.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:12.740]   We run five acres, small home with a shop and some other stuff for being off-grid.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:19.980]   But anyway, this other company offered to move us closer, which is actually closer to
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.980]   family.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.600]   It's about an hour closer to family.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.780]   And so we'd be about 10 to 15 minutes closer.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:31.200]   I'm sorry, 10 to 15 minutes from family in this new area.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:42.960]   But the dilemma is, do I stay and pursue my part-time side job and let it grow while spending
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.540]   more time with family?
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:51.780]   Or do I continue to do this technical job with the side job, being closer to family
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:52.780]   and help?
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.940]   I don't know what answers you need from me.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.520]   Do you need more time with your family?
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.040]   Time is a commodity right now.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.640]   I have a two-year-old and a three-month-old.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   Oh, sorry.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:14.000]   Do you mean my wife and kids or do you mean my extended family?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.280]   Do you need to spend more time with your family right now?
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.040]   I would like to.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:33.360]   But as a husband and father, I'm also trying to not neglect that aspect of having a good,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   strong income.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   I don't ask the question as a joke.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.960]   I ask it as a genuine question.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.400]   Let me just give some examples.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.920]   I mean, a guy – let's say that you come in and you've got a 15-year-old kid and you
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.960]   come in and surprise your 15-year-old kid in his bedroom and he's sitting there cutting
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   himself.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.600]   Well, obviously, you need more with your family.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.760]   And so you quit your job, you sell everything, you go and hike the Adirondack Trail and you
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.200]   fix your son, whatever can be done.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.400]   You go crazy, you act like a maniac and you fix it.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.760]   You pour all of your energy and all of your focus onto this.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.440]   And the thing that you obviously desperately need in that situation because your son is
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:22.200]   abandoned and going – I don't mean to be too hyperbolic here, but he's down a very
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   wrong path.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.960]   He could be dead in two years.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.400]   Then you desperately need time with your family.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:33.520]   And so as a father, then you completely reorient everything else in your life and you fix that.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.720]   And that basic principle applies at different times.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.120]   I mean, let's say you've got a – I don't know.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.880]   You've got two children right now, but let's say you've got four children, a four-year-old,
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:50.960]   a three-year-old, a two-year-old and a one-year-old, and your wife is falling apart and the burden
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.160]   is just enormous and you're worried about her health, et cetera, then obviously, yes,
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.200]   you need more time with the family.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.320]   On the other hand, if you're doing your job well and you're a good husband and your
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.200]   wife is strengthened and she's doing well and you've got healthy children, et cetera,
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   then you don't need more time with your family.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.280]   And that's where I think that there's something that is happening in our current age.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.800]   And I'm probably guilty of perpetuating this, but there's some kind of idea that
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:22.680]   has been created that somehow an ideal man is a man who's with his family 168 hours
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.920]   a week.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:30.320]   And while I clearly care very much about family, your family, you being there for yours, me
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.200]   being there with mine, I don't think that's the ideal.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.600]   I don't think that that's a proper framework.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   I don't think that we look at the idea of time with family and say that 168 hours a
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:52.480]   week is the perfect standard, 158 hours a week with our family is a grade B, and so
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.720]   therefore, 40 hours a week with our family is an F, and we've got to move ourselves better
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.120]   by spending more time with our family.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.160]   I have made statements such as it's quality of time at work that counts and quantity of
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.240]   time at home that counts.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.040]   I think that that is true and that matters.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.800]   I want to be with my family.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:16.680]   I have made lifestyle decisions that have allowed me to be with my family 168 hours
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:22.080]   a week, but I reject the idea that that's the only correct path and that that is the
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.680]   only thing that you as a husband are responsible for doing.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.460]   So as you said, the amount of income that your family has matters.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.320]   It matters a lot.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.440]   And your work matters.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.440]   It matters a lot.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.440]   It is important.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.280]   Your work is important.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.600]   Your contribution to the world through your work is important.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.200]   Your sense of mission in your job is important.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.800]   The things that you do are important.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.640]   And so as a man, you have to look at your family and you have to say, "Do I need more
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.280]   time with my family?
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.600]   And what is the cost of that time versus how kind of other things are going well?"
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.600]   And here's where you want to consider your family situation.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.880]   You want to, I mean, there's a huge difference between a guy who has a wife who's a full-time
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.600]   mother, he can get in his car, he can go off and work a long day just totally confident
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.400]   that his children are well cared for, that they know that mommy and daddy love me.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.320]   That's a very different scenario than husband and wife who both have demanding jobs and
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.840]   they rush off in the morning and they don't even see the kids because the babysitter or
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.960]   the au pair gets the children ready for work, etc.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:36.800]   And so there's not an ideal perfect standard.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   It's a standard that will adjust and will adapt throughout your life.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.080]   And in terms of time with family, the thing that I don't even want to say it again because
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.960]   I've said it a bazillion times quite literally on the – not quite literally, that was not
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   right.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.640]   I've said it many, many times on the show and I feel like I'm just always over here
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.880]   beating this drum and I should quit beating that drum and find a new drum to beat on.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.920]   But things like the age of your children matters.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:05.520]   If you've got a two-year-old and a three-month-old, as a father, there's really very little – like
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.600]   obviously you want to play with your children and be there and build a relationship, etc.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.960]   But you're being there with them more and let's say you could free up five hours a
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:19.580]   day, it's not particularly productive especially if your wife is there with them for those
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.520]   extra five hours a day.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.800]   It's not that productive.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.320]   And so again, if your wife is falling apart, if she needs your help, if she needs your
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.200]   support in some way, then you roll up your sleeves and you strengthen your home.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.400]   But if your home is strong and things are going well, then you keep focusing on building
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.480]   what you need to build, building the empire, building your dynasty, building your vision,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   etc.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.800]   Yeah, it's the former.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.400]   She's struggling and we want more kids.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.440]   Okay, so now, good.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440]   So perfect.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.360]   Thank you for interrupting me because I was – so if your wife is struggling, then you
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:58.160]   need to strengthen your wife and you have to then look at your wife, your individual
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.880]   wife, not a generic woman but your woman, you need to look at your household and you
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.960]   need wisdom and you need to apply wisdom and say, "How do I strengthen my wife and
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.320]   how do I strengthen my household?"
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.840]   One way of doing it might be for you to be involved and for you to be there.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.320]   I have done this, right?
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.920]   I have many young children.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.520]   I have done this.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.700]   I have done this repeatedly on different occasions.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.800]   In many ways, I'm much better at running my household than my wife is in terms of just
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.940]   keeping everything running very, very well.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:34.660]   And so if she's struggling, then I step in and I try to work on things.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.740]   We've had various discipline issues with various children.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:43.340]   And if my children are disrespecting my wife and they're not obedient, then I have to
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.920]   step in and I have to correct that.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.980]   But I don't look at it as a long-term career.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.900]   I look at it as I have a responsibility to change this and as soon as I get this child's
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:59.840]   behavior changed and fixed so that he or she is back in a proper place of respectful obedience
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.260]   and respect for my wife, etc., then my goal is not to just to be there.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.600]   And it's kind of a balance, right?
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.120]   Because if my wife is struggling, the goal is not for me to just take over.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:17.380]   The goal is for me to strengthen her, to help support her so that she's no longer struggling,
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:24.500]   and then for her to grow and be stronger in her area of domain and her area of responsibility.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.580]   And that sometimes comes from you, right?
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.660]   A three-month-old is rough.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:33.460]   We've had a rough year with our fifth baby.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.380]   Last year was really difficult and a lot of it was difficult just because of having a
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.780]   baby in the house.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.940]   And so you adapt to that, but don't think it's a long-term thing.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.380]   It doesn't have to be a long-term thing.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.660]   It's just this is what it's like dealing with babies.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.460]   And you may have a particularly difficult baby.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.980]   You have a sick baby, etc.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.760]   And all that stuff is draining.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.180]   So you figure out what is there.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.820]   Now I would remind you, though, that you being home is a great solution.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.200]   It's not the only solution.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:06.660]   And so sometimes a better solution is find somebody who can lighten the load for her.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.500]   Find a housekeeper who can come in, who can clean the house so she doesn't need to do
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   that.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:17.140]   Find a really great place to put your two-year-old for the morning so she has a break.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.140]   Find someone, a family member, who can come over and be in the home a couple days so she
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.820]   can have some time to herself and go for a walk around the neighborhood, etc.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.260]   Sometimes it is just you being there.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.900]   But look at it holistically and then make your job decisions, your career decisions
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:39.180]   in light of what you think is the best solution for your family.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:44.300]   If the stress is primarily due to the difficulties of a three-month-old baby, then just recognize
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.540]   that this is not necessarily a long-term thing.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:52.300]   And so don't commit yourself to a long-term solution of quitting a job or something like
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.740]   that when good chance four months from now you're out of the woods, she's back to her
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:02.180]   normal self, she's feeling good, she's fully recovered, she's sleeping, the baby's back
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.580]   healthy, etc.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.900]   And then finally, don't neglect whatever solving the actual needs are.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.420]   So for example, with a baby, don't neglect, you know, why is this baby not sleeping so
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.480]   that my wife is frazzled because she's not sleeping.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.900]   Is there something that can be done?
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:20.020]   Be really good at driving your family through all of those things on a comprehensive way.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.180]   >> Yeah, it's actually the opposite.
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.660]   It's actually our two-year-old that's very strong-willed and bucking against the power
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.420]   as it were.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:35.460]   And so the problem is right now we bought five acres in a property and we're kind of
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.460]   isolated.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.060]   We're not, I mean, I guess that's the whole point of buying five acres on land.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.100]   Really pretty property, but we're not near family.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.620]   We're about probably an hour away from family.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.580]   And so, and we put our oldest daughter on Mother's Day out.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.460]   We don't really like a full daycare schedule.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.660]   It's like two days a week just so we could be present.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:48:02.100]   And so with the W-2 job, we would have to either move or, and they've actually said
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.700]   they would accommodate a hybrid schedule.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.580]   So I would basically drive an hour two days a week or three days a week and then work
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.220]   from home two days a week so that we could keep, you know, the house.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:17.060]   But I honestly don't know if that's the best for our family, you know, because again, we're
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:22.860]   isolated a little bit further out from the city versus again, my wife, you know, us being
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.780]   a little bit, you know, maybe 10 to 15 minutes from family.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.180]   But one thing we realized, Josh, was unless it's very convenient for family to help, they
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.780]   just don't.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:37.620]   And yeah, I think that's just, we were starting to realize that both of our parents are past,
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:42.180]   my parents and her parents are not in the picture, so they're not helpful.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:48.460]   And so we just realized people that have jobs don't really, don't really got other way to
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.460]   help.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:54.780]   And so it's unfortunate, but it's just kind of the way it is with our siblings.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   So.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.980]   I would not say that you were wrong if you left your job, moved or whatever the actual
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:05.900]   circumstances are so that you could be there, you know, as a stay at home dad or very close
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.340]   to that for a significant period of time.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:14.220]   And in many ways, it kind of feels like that's almost what we have to do in today's world.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.660]   If you've got a big vision of the family that you're trying to build and the work that's
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.500]   going to be involved in that, etc, then you have to do that.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:29.180]   I have sacrificed enormously in my career, in my business, in all of my own pursuits,
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:33.900]   because I have a vision for the family empire that I desire to build and the dynasty that
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.800]   I desire to leave behind.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:41.640]   And so it's costly and it's financially costly and costly in many ways.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:46.120]   And so I respect you for that decision if that's what you choose to do.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.360]   And I'm not trying to, I'm not going to be able to, nor am I willing even to give you
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.980]   an answer on this just to help you think it through.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.040]   So just understand what the core issues are.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.960]   The reason I was saying like I would respect you for that is that for whatever reason,
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:11.680]   our culture is not, and this is very key to kind of the American culture, every positive
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.480]   good or value has a negative flip side, right?
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:24.560]   Confidence and assertiveness are positive traits, but the flip side is aggression or
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.600]   mowing people down and lack of empathy, right?
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.020]   So everything can have a positive trait.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:36.520]   In the United States, we are a very independent people, and that leads to a lot of positive
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.480]   traits.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:44.160]   But what has happened is we have taken our individualistic independence and we've taken
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:48.800]   it to the absolute maximum, to the point where you see this in our culture, where the greatest
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:55.960]   sin that anybody could think could be foisted against them is for somebody to try to minimize
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.160]   their libertarian freedom to do whatever they want to do.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.380]   And so who are you to tell me I can't do that?
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.380]   You can't tell me.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.160]   It's like this extreme, ugly form of independence.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:12.700]   And so our culture lacks any sense of coherent interdependence as a cultural value.
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:16.480]   And so we have no collective culture.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:22.520]   And that lack of collective culture expresses itself in our families, our churches, our
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.800]   neighborhoods, et cetera, that we just don't work together.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   And so it's tragic.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:35.360]   It's a very lonely existence compared to some aspects of a collective culture.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.880]   It has its positive upsides.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.760]   You listen to somebody who comes from a very collectivist culture, and they talk about
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.460]   the pressure that's put on them and the control that's put on them, and they're just happy
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.800]   to be left alone.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   So everything has a positive and a negative.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:56.200]   But I affirm that in the American culture, it's very unlikely for you to get the kind
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:01.960]   of support that you would like to get from your family members, from your community,
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.960]   et cetera.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.520]   We're all—it's the same for everybody.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:12.880]   And so what that means is it has put an enormous pressure on people who have children, and
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:19.480]   it's much, much harder to have children today because of this, where you basically have
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.720]   to bear the load alone.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:26.500]   And so that—and it's one reason many people don't want to have children or don't want
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:31.680]   to have more children, et cetera, is because they know they've got to bear the load alone.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.160]   And so I don't have any great solutions.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.480]   I've just accepted that this is the way it is, and I'm just going to have to bear the
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.840]   load alone, which means I have to build stronger shoulders, my wife has to build stronger shoulders,
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:52.160]   and we'll just—I'll make up my own strategies to get through it, and I'll arrange my life
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.160]   to do it.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:57.640]   And it's kind of ultimately what I've come to.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:04.200]   And again, I'm not casting any harm or any blame on anybody.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.640]   I have wonderful family members.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.640]   I've got great friends.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.960]   I've got neighbors, et cetera.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:16.560]   But we don't know how to really work together, nor are we particularly willing to work together.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.080]   And so like in—here's just an example.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:23.240]   I'm stereotyping, but I believe this stereotype is true.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:27.320]   If you went to your siblings or your in-laws or whomever it is in your family, and you
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.400]   say to them, "Hey, guys, listen.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.440]   There's a town that is—or even just our friends, right?"
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.780]   And we said, "Look, there's a town that's 300 miles away, and they've got houses that
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.280]   are great houses, mansions for 50 grand apiece.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:44.520]   If all of us moved there, we could all be neighbors, and we could live a great life,
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.440]   and we could support one another, we could encourage one another, et cetera."
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.920]   In the American culture, it doesn't fly.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   It doesn't work.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.280]   It's never worked.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.280]   People won't do it.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   Nobody will move.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   Nobody is willing to work together.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.920]   Nobody is willing to sacrifice my independence to go and do that.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.080]   Meanwhile, all around the world, people that are from more collectivist cultures, one person
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:08.680]   goes to another country, gets a residence visa, gets a house, brings over two of his
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   siblings.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.560]   He's got his brother there, and everyone's putting their money in the pot.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.840]   They got 18 people living in a two-bedroom apartment, and all of a sudden, 10 years later,
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.300]   everyone's rich because they're willing to work together.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:24.440]   It happens every single day, and it's this cultural values of collectivism versus individualism.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.440]   Not ironically.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.440]   That was my father.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:34.080]   My father came from Pakistan, and three, four siblings living in a house, four-bedroom,
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:40.720]   two-bath house for 10 years before they split up.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:46.480]   It sounds like you probably took the ... If you were in my position, you probably took
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:52.720]   the, "Hey, I'm going to be the family, raise my kids," because I want a strong family.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.800]   We both would like three, four, maybe five kids.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:03.120]   My wife is rethinking that now, though, with the realization that, "Oh, David is not ... He's
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:09.680]   out of the home, and he's working back at a W-2 job."
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.840]   I don't want to forsake that for ... I guess ... We're Coast Fire, right?
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:17.480]   Just putting that out there.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:22.640]   Is there anything that you look back now ... I don't think I would have any regrets from
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:28.920]   a time perspective of just being like, "Wow, I had so much time with my kids in their formative
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.960]   years and even as they grew up."
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.760]   Are there things from a financial perspective?
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:40.280]   I guess that's the only thing that I am concerned about, that 2024 and onward are just rocky
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.840]   years and my side job is now my main job and my only job.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:51.980]   All of a sudden, we have to, from an income perspective, we have to go on a rice and beans
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:52.980]   type of diet.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   Maybe it'll be worth it.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.980]   I don't know.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:59.560]   David: If I were doing it over again, I would not change any of the decisions that I myself
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.800]   have made because we have five children, my wife and I.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:09.880]   If I just left her at home all day and said, "You got to be super mom," especially with
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:18.080]   things like homeschooling and whatnot, it's impossible for a woman to do that in our world.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.320]   It's also ... One more comment on that.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:28.780]   It's impossible because of the standards that are imposed upon us by our society or on ourselves.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.860]   If we were to go back 75 years ago, and I see this all around the world more clearly
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:36.660]   than I do in the United States, but I know it's there in the United States, the standards
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:41.300]   for what was expected from a parent were relatively modest.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.480]   It was expected that you fed your children at least as much as you could and they ate
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.660]   a couple times a day.
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:52.220]   It was expected that they went to school, and beyond that, children had an enormous
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.780]   degree of freedom.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:57:00.700]   Our culture was very open to children and they could come and go.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.020]   They could come and go in the house.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.500]   They could go and play in the neighborhood.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.500]   They entertained themselves.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.140]   They took care of themselves, et cetera.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:10.980]   I just finished reading with my perfect example, if you want a picture of the world before.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:15.940]   I just finished reading the third of the Moffat series of books to my family.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.940]   It's Elizabeth Estes.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:17.940]   I think it's Elizabeth.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.220]   Anyway, her name is Estes.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.740]   She wrote this great trilogy of books, amazing children's author.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.820]   The first one is called Meet the Moffats.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:26.820]   Forget the second one.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.560]   The third one is called Rufus.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:34.420]   They're all about these children that are living in a fairly typical town, New York,
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.540]   something like that, actually in New York State.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.940]   The mother is a widow and she has four children.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:41.980]   She's a dressmaker.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.280]   That's how she earns her income.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.340]   They're clearly basically in poverty.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:51.780]   But what's so fascinating about the story is that basically the children are free-range
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:55.100]   kids all the time.
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.940]   They sleep at home and they have dinners with their mother, but beyond that, they come and
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:04.620]   go around the town as they wish and they are what today we would call free-range kids.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.320]   This was entirely normal.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.300]   This was the normal way of being.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:13.200]   The children are not a great impediment to your life in that situation.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:18.640]   Well, fast forward to today, if you let your children walk to the park half a mile away,
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.400]   the police are going to get four calls on why are these unsupervised children walking
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.120]   to the park.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:32.200]   Basically every single layer of our society has built up to like with this intense protectionism
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.760]   where nothing can happen.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.640]   You can't ask your sister to take your children and first of all, no one would take their
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.200]   kids to the mall and just leave them.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.360]   A lot of us grew up in the day in which that was a fairly normal thing.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.360]   No cell phones.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.360]   Okay, I'll take you to the mall.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.360]   I'll pick you up at 6 o'clock.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.560]   But even if you ask them to take them today, of course, you can only take our children
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.680]   to a supervised place with lots of referees and lots of padding where we're going to
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.000]   pay $30 for playtime and latte.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.160]   So you ask your sister to do that.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.800]   Oh no, I can't do that because she's got to have car seats.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.160]   And so she's got two children and your two children need to have two car seats and of
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.480]   course four car seats can't fit in the car so she can't do it.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:18.120]   And so basically that's our society in a nutshell is it makes everything about it is forcing
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:22.560]   families to be individualized, forcing families to do it all themselves.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.240]   You have to take your children because you're the only one with car seats and your friends
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.000]   can't pick them up and so you can't even get an afternoon off.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.060]   And so why am I ranting about this?
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.320]   Just to say that this is what has happened.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:41.400]   And so children are instead of being a relatively not that big of a deal, they become an enormous
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.840]   nuisance in our society based upon the way that they are.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.920]   And this is one of the many reasons why birth rates have collapsed around the world.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.280]   Now you can change that, right?
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.880]   You got five acres and so your kids can be free-range kids.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.880]   I live on a farm.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.120]   My children are free-range kids to a significant degree.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.840]   And what happens is you have more of them then you realize I don't have to be quite
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.320]   so uptight as I was with the first time around and I can just let them hang out and that's
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:11.640]   actually good for them and you wind up with a bigger car and so you can fit them and things
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   change.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:17.320]   And so they don't over time you become your standards can change and you recognize it's
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.740]   not such a demanding thing.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:28.500]   But it is still demanding and it would be a very unusually strong woman who would be
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:36.080]   able to have four or five children in a situation like you're describing and be able to do it
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.340]   without significant input and help from you.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:45.660]   I know a few women who do it and they are incredible women, incredibly strong women.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:50.540]   But if you want to have a large family then you've got to make sure that your wife is
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:55.720]   on board with that and a significant component of that is just going to be meeting her needs
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.140]   and taking care of her.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:04.820]   And so that's what I did is that I made that decision and I have sacrificed a lot to do
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.340]   it and I believe that it's the decision that I'll be happy with at the end of my life.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.300]   I'm quite happy with it right now but it is a lot.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.580]   And what I have seen also is that my wife is much, much stronger today than she was
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.060]   10 years ago.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:29.100]   And so being a mother and being a father these are skills that develop over time.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:34.320]   I'm a vastly better father today than I was 10 years ago and she is as well.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.260]   And so I can do more, she can do more, etc.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.180]   And it's just a matter of kind of changing your perspective.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:50.300]   And last story, like literally today my eldest two are away at a short-term camp and I'm
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.940]   sitting at the table with my younger three and just thinking like, "This isn't difficult.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.980]   This is – the house is quiet."
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.900]   Anytime you go from five to three it's like, "This is easy.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.460]   I could do this in no time."
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.780]   But it wasn't that way when I had three children.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:09.020]   And so just recognize that if you've got a vision you're going to have to press through
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.780]   and I think it's the vision that will pay off at the end of your life.
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:14.580]   And you've worked really hard to get to this point.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:19.700]   And if you have to take 10 years and go on to kind of a sideline career track and then
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:23.420]   10 years from now you step back in then that would be fine.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:28.420]   What you should do – but this was actually – I intended to say this but I got sidetracked
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.420]   with my monologue.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:33.740]   What you should do and what I have done is always try to keep a good backup plan.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:39.220]   So every year for example I pay the CFP board – I can't remember what their dues are.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.940]   It's like $600 a year, something like that.
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.780]   And every year that stupid bill comes in.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:49.060]   And every year I sit there and I look at it and I don't today care at all about being
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.380]   a certified financial planner.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.220]   It makes no difference to me whatsoever.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:56.980]   It's like the day that I passed the exam and I put it on my business card it completely
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.100]   lost all meaning to me.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:05.380]   It's like you graduate from high school and then you're enrolled in college and
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.940]   all of a sudden your high school graduation – wow, what does it mean?
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.380]   I'm a freshman again.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.500]   And so I don't care at all about being a certified financial planner.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.540]   I practically don't even tell anyone although I've tried to change that.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:21.260]   But I've always kept all those designations and I pay that $600 bill every year because
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:27.380]   it's my backup plan so that if for some reason my business failed or I needed it I
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:33.380]   can go and I can quickly get re-employed and in a month I can have a job making a few hundred
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.860]   thousand dollars a year and I can get the interview because of the credentials, etc.
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.900]   And I can make that happen.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.980]   And so those things are really important.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.980]   And so look at your job and your career and ask yourself, "Do I have an easy on-ramp
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:47.980]   back-in?"
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:56.020]   Because I think the people who suffer the most of dialing back their career for a time
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:01.940]   are those who wind up becoming irrelevant and obsolete.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:06.540]   Their skills start to atrophy and if they don't have the ability to get back in then
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.540]   it really hurts them.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:11.760]   And where you see this hurt a lot of – where this is the most obvious is when you look
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.020]   at moms, mothers who become stay-at-home mothers.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:21.100]   They pay an enormous price in their career options because they step out of the workforce
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.480]   to raise children.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.540]   And so they're at the top of their career and they're 30 years old and she goes home,
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.180]   spends 10 years raising babies and then she wants to go back in.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:34.860]   Well, she's looking around at all of her friends and they're all 10 years ahead and
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.900]   she's not able to compete with them in the workforce.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.180]   And so that can be a frustrating thing.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.700]   And so if she doesn't value the fact that she's got four children that they don't
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:49.940]   have and then it's a big price for her to pay.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.820]   And the same thing can apply to someone in your situation.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.220]   So it's a price that I would pay.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:58.780]   It's a price that I have paid, I am paying and I would pay again.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.180]   But it's also something where you want to be smart.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.260]   Keep your certifications, keep your contacts, keep yourself connected, make sure you have
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:10.140]   a good backup plan so that if you quit your job you can go back in again and start over
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.100]   again and create the money that your family needs.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:20.380]   And if you off ramped, aside from like healthcare maybe going on to the exchange, are there
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:31.180]   any other financial uh-ohs that you've experienced?
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:40.340]   Most of the issues are psychological rather than practical.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.740]   Once you reach this point, especially if you've accumulated assets and you're coast
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:49.340]   fi, etc. you know how to do the tactical everyday stuff.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.600]   You know how to make sure you don't overspend your income.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.160]   You know how to do all that stuff.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:06:04.860]   So a lot of it is psychological because as a man you want to compete and slipping into
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:09.560]   irrelevant oblivion is a big price to pay.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:14.500]   It's basically part of the same standard speech that I give to men who are retiring.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.060]   I don't think men should retire from work even when they can afford to.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:26.500]   And the reason is that work provides us with a lot of things that a lot of self-worth and
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:31.900]   self-image that cannot be achieved sitting at home.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:36.480]   In your work you are respected, you're looked up to, you're a leader, you have influence,
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.320]   you have authority, you have power, etc.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.900]   And when you leave your job you lose those things and you become just another guy.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.300]   If you're old, just another old guy.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.860]   And it doesn't matter how much money you have, you're just another old guy.
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:53.340]   And I think even in a lot of cases this can cause problems in your marriage.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.460]   That one reason your wife is attracted to you is because you're confident, you're a
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:01.020]   leader, you're looked up to, you're respected, other people respect you and that increases
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.700]   her attraction to you.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:07.820]   She's attracted to you because you're a high status man in some circle, in your job, in
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.020]   your business, in whatever it is that you do.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.540]   And you come home and you're just kind of the guy sitting around the house, there are
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.500]   a lot of psychological costs to that.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:21.660]   And if you don't have some way to manage those costs then that can be the biggest thing that
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.660]   affects you.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:26.000]   It's not the money, it's not living on your income.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.200]   You can do that and your expenses can go down and you can live well on not a ton of money.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.780]   But if you experience those psychological things they can be pretty heavy.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.860]   Now it's not insurmountable.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:45.740]   I have taken an enormous amount of joy in the work that I do with my children's education.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:54.420]   There is no possible way that anyone else in the world would be able to, any school
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:59.460]   or any tutor that I found would be able to help my children to achieve at the level that
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:05.100]   I have been able to coach them into in their academics and in other non-academic pursuits
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.100]   as well.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.100]   Because I'm trying to build a well-rounded education.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.360]   So I take a lot of joy in that and a lot of sense of self-worth in that.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:17.180]   But it is also a weakness in my life that I'm trying to change.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:21.820]   Is that being alone and independent, it's not good for a man to be alone.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:29.420]   And being alone and independent, it comes with a cost.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.580]   It's not good.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:34.940]   And so it's a decision that I made but if I were to make it over that would be the biggest
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:39.020]   thing that I would work hard to fix and I'm working hard to fix, to be more connected.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.020]   Especially with babies and whatnot.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.020]   I used to travel.
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.020]   You got me in story mode.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.020]   I used to travel.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.300]   I used to be involved in all the communities.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.620]   I used to go to all the conferences like I tell other people to do, etc.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.660]   And it got to the point where if I left it was just so hard on my wife.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:58.540]   I couldn't leave her in a difficult situation, be gone for a week here and a week there and
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.540]   whatnot.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:00.540]   There's men who do it.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:01.540]   There's women who can handle it.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:09.060]   But since I don't have to do it, it didn't feel like I should do that.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:14.140]   How can I put that on her and cause her to bear that heavy load of me being gone traveling
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.180]   when I don't have to go and do it?
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:23.140]   But that has caused me to in many ways feel less relevant, less connected, less accomplished,
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.540]   less successful.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:30.660]   And it has come at the cost of just basically being a devoted father.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:36.820]   And so again, I accept those costs but it's not something that I want to continue.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:38.700]   And so even this year I'm traveling more.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.700]   I'm away more.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.260]   I'm connecting with people more.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.540]   I'm working to connect people with more.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:46.020]   But it was an intense period of life.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.700]   My eldest is 10 and my youngest is a year.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.420]   And it's been an intense period of life.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.460]   And so I don't see any way around it in our culture.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:00.160]   It used to be that if you could figure out a community where there's a lot of women and
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.580]   grandmothers and whatnot who could help your wife and a great community of people, the
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.220]   children can run out the door and spend all day playing, go there.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.220]   But lacking that, you're just going to have to do it.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:14.540]   But try to handle these costs and be intelligent about how you approach them.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.940]   >>Joseph: And sorry, last question.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:22.140]   If I wanted to off-ramp, like let's say I was like, "Hey, I'm going to do the technical
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:26.260]   full-time position and the side hustle until X years."
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.260]   At what age?
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:29.260]   I mean, you've done this for a long time now.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:36.780]   At what age is, I mean, as I've said, two and three months old, at what age do you start
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:43.540]   having those experiences where they're actually, I mean, I know kids are always learning, but
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:48.540]   is there a certain age where it's like, "Okay, you're really developing those strong ties."
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.620]   >>Tavis: Six.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.240]   Six is magic.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.240]   Six is magic.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.060]   And it's like with babies, I mean, I love my babies.
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.440]   They're cute, et cetera.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.980]   But I don't really have an emotional connection to babies like my wife does.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:06.420]   A mother somehow builds, thank God she does, right?
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.660]   Because the baby wrecks her life for a year.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:15.460]   But a mother, my wife sees her babies and she's just filled with this exuberance and
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.980]   joy and what a cute baby.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:20.260]   For me, it's like it's a baby and I have to take care of it.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:26.020]   And I take care of it and whatnot, but it's not really, I don't really connect with babies.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:30.300]   And then they're one and they're walking and then they're two and eventually they start
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:34.100]   talking and then they're three and they're four and whatnot.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.020]   And I try to do my best to be the dad who plays.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.420]   I want to be the dad who plays with my children and whatnot, because I know that that stuff
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.540]   matters and so I do it as much as I'm able to.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:48.420]   But the joy for me is never about the kid.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:55.220]   The joy for me as a father is about who the young man or the young woman will be, where
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:12:01.860]   you really start to see that stuff is around five, around six and beyond.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:10.540]   And so in my mind, the ages from six to about 12 are golden, because depending on the level
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:17.220]   of intellectual and emotional maturity, at six-ish, and again, there's no hard line,
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:21.100]   but around six, you're dealing with a child who can think.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.580]   And of course, they love to ask questions and it's question after question after question
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:25.740]   after question.
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:32.500]   And so being with a human being who can think is infinitely more satisfying to me than interacting
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.380]   with a human being who's just driven by his or her emotions.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:43.860]   And then there's that just golden period from six to 12, where there's not really any need
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.380]   for outside experience.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.700]   There's not really any need for outside.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:54.260]   What I mean is children don't need friends outside of their family if they have a lot
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.260]   of siblings.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:00.620]   Obviously, you work to do that, because socialization is important.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:05.260]   And so you try to make sure they have friends and you try to make sure that they have opportunities
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.260]   to learn to play well with others, et cetera.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.220]   Those are important social skills, but there's no real need.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.740]   They don't have an emotional need for that.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:16.860]   Their whole source of supply of stability comes from their family, from their siblings,
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.980]   from their parents, et cetera.
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:22.620]   And so it's just that to me, that's the golden time where you have an individual who can
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:26.380]   think and you have an individual that you can really pour into.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:31.940]   And you don't need to encourage independence in a child that young.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:38.140]   Now when you get to a child who's, say, 11, 12, et cetera, then now you need to start
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:43.780]   making sure that the child is developing his or her own independent interests.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:47.820]   And you need to make sure that there's more and more confidence and self-confidence is
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.020]   being built in strength.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:55.220]   And so you're intentionally maintaining the closeness of relationship, and you're trying
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:59.660]   to keep your children connected to you emotionally, but you're trying to make sure that they have
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:07.380]   room to explore and investigate their own things and to have space to make their mistakes
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.300]   and have to respond to other people and learn lessons, et cetera.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:15.420]   So to me, those are the golden years that things really pay off and they start to remember
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.220]   stuff, et cetera.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:21.300]   And so I love traveling with my children.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.740]   I love doing their school.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.900]   I love supervising all those things.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:29.380]   I really enjoy it because my older children, they're able to think and they ask me questions
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:31.380]   and it leads to interesting conversations, et cetera.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:35.460]   And I really feel like you're building something and you don't yet have to deal with their
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:41.940]   independent ambitions and you don't yet have to coach them to independence because of their
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.940]   youth.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.980]   And so I'm circling back on one question.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:54.540]   So on the, like I said, we're about an hour away from family, but we're on five acres.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.540]   Would that play a factor?
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.220]   I mean, would you, forget about the job and all that.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:05.420]   Would you, would it be better to be closer to family, sell our house on five acres and
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.180]   move into the city?
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:13.260]   It's not my preference just because I feel like for the last like seven years, I mean,
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:18.260]   listening to you and other people and just making my own thoughts, I think living out
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.780]   in the country is a better decision.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:29.900]   But regardless, what weight or factor do you put on that in terms of raising a family?
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:35.900]   One primary reason that I live where I live is I live on a very large property where I
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.460]   can simply tell the children, go outside.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.900]   My wife can tell the children, go outside.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.940]   Do not come in until I call you for dinner.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:51.700]   And that I believe is really, really important both for the sanity and good functioning of
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:55.340]   our household and also for children.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:16:02.000]   That today in today's world, one of the most important gifts that we need to give our children
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.460]   is significant quantities of unstructured playtime outside.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:11.900]   And that is something that is really, really important.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.620]   And it's important on every level.
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:19.500]   Physiologically, we are living in right now, I'm not using hyperbole, we are living in
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:23.180]   an epidemic of myopia, nearsightedness.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:31.800]   And a significant causal factor seems to be that the epidemic of myopia is that children
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:38.060]   are not outside and they're constantly engaged in some form of close work, always reading
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.300]   a book, on a screen, writing, something up close.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:47.860]   And so quite literally, our children's eyes are losing the ability to focus normally and
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:51.620]   to function normally because they're spending all their time with stuff that's in their
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.620]   faces.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.140]   They're also not getting enough sunlight.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:59.160]   And so their eyes are not being stimulated sufficiently with sufficient sunlight.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:07.020]   And so minimum, children need to be outside for at least two to three hours a day, ideally
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.020]   more.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:13.660]   And that's to say nothing of the benefits of free play, of the benefits of exploring,
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:18.840]   the physical benefits of running and throwing and climbing and etc., and interacting with
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.220]   their siblings, etc.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.500]   It's fundamentally important.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.880]   And it's very, very difficult to do that in the city.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.180]   It's very difficult to do it in the suburbs.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.900]   And so, you know, depending on what you're talking about, obviously many children have
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.900]   raised that.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:38.820]   But again, back to the issues with being reported to CPS is that you will get reported that
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:43.840]   you will have Child Protective Services knocking on your door if you let your children go out
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.900]   alone to the park.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.920]   The American culture is utterly broken right now on this topic.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:56.800]   And so if you went back to say 1940s Brooklyn, then the children weren't hindered by living
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.840]   in a tenement house because they were outside playing in the street and on the abandoned
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.840]   lot, etc.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.840]   And that was normal.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.900]   Today, the children growing up in Brooklyn, they can't play in the street.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.440]   And so this is one of the problems.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.440]   And what's your solution?
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.240]   Well, either we change the culture, and some people are doing that.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.120]   Either we normalize again the fact that it's perfectly reasonable for your eight-year-old
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.480]   and your nine-year-old to ride their bikes half a mile to go to the park and play at
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.400]   the park for a couple hours and then come home.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.240]   So either we normalize that or what's your solution?
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:32.920]   Your solution is to go to a place where you can do that on basically the sanctity of your
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.960]   own property and/or in a culture that accepts that, and a rural culture is more accepting
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.300]   of that.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:45.560]   And so I believe that it's necessary that children have multiple hours a day of outside
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.840]   play.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:52.520]   And if you look at kind of a barren suburb quarter acre or half acre even, etc., it's
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.440]   got one tiny little swing set in it, what are they going to do?
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.440]   They got nothing to do.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.160]   And here's the other aspect, is that basically everything associated with living in the suburbs
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.480]   or living in the city, to keep your sanity as a father, you want to keep everything nice.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.480]   And so you don't want your children digging in the backyard and destroying your nice pretty
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480]   yard.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.560]   But if you got five acres, you can say, "Listen, do you see this place near the house?
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560]   You don't dig here.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.560]   The rest of it where I can..."
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   That's basically my rule with my children.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.320]   I'm like, "Don't bring the stuff onto the porch.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.120]   If I don't see it, it's okay.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.320]   And you can have as much of a mess as you want out there, but I don't want to see it."
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.440]   And it works.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.240]   So then they can get those benefits.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.120]   So yeah, I would...
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.640]   In terms of your lifestyle, I think that you'll...
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.600]   Since it's unlikely that your siblings would be able and willing to change their lifestyle
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:54.240]   structure such that you're willing to spend 15 to 20 hours a week working together so
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.200]   that you can send your children over on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and they can send their children
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.920]   over on Thursdays and Fridays, et cetera, and interacting.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:07.480]   Unless there's some strong indication that you can work together on a close basis, you're
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.800]   better off being an hour away and having five acres than the opposite.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   Okay.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   That's helpful.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.920]   Yeah, I think the word for this year is being intentional.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.920]   We have to just...
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:18.920]   They're not going to come see us.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:19.920]   We have to go see them.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.920]   We have to be intentional about it.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.920]   Whether we're 10 minutes or an hour away.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920]   All right.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   Thanks, Joshua.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920]   Have a good weekend.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   My pleasure.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   Just recognize as you're making all these decisions that the pregnancy stuff...
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.960]   Or sorry, the baby stuff, there's no...
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:38.880]   Don't make long-term decisions over short-term factors.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.480]   I've never met a mother who wanted to have a baby when she had a three-month-old.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.200]   So just relax and get through it.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.080]   Do your best to help her recover.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.240]   Work really hard to have her physical energy.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.320]   Work really hard to have her sunlight.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.480]   Work really hard to help her get fully...
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.120]   To have as much sleep as possible, even though it's not going to be all connected, et cetera.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.960]   Work really hard if she has any symptoms of postpartum depression, anything like that.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.520]   Work really hard at that stuff.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.920]   And then recognize six months from now, you're going to be in a very different situation.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.400]   Anyway, thanks for the stimulating conversation.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.200]   That sort of kind of was about finances, but about the actual purpose of finances much
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.200]   more.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.200]   Thanks, Joshua.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.200]   I appreciate it.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.200]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.200]   My pleasure.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.960]   All right, that wraps up our final call for today.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.720]   And let's see as we go, announcements.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.840]   I said as we go, remember I'm doing consulting appointments right now during the month of
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.840]   January.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.840]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.200]   Sign up there, radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.920]   Or if you just like to call me up and talk to me next week on the show, go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:47.280]   I hope that these conversations are useful.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.920]   I always wondered on radical personal finance, of course, it's easy for me to do on a Friday
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:58.520]   show, but I always think carefully about the content and things that I cover.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:03.160]   And the point of it is that these are the reasons that we have money.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:10.760]   And we have a culture that has made the foolish decision to focus primarily on numbers on
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.640]   a balance sheet.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:17.720]   And we do that, we make that focus because numbers are easy to measure.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:23.840]   Money as a goal is something that is easy to measure because it is numerical.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:29.040]   But just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean that that is the ideal measurement
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.480]   to shoot for.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.200]   Money is a tool that allows us to live the life that we want, have access to certain
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.440]   things, et cetera.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.920]   And so we need in personal finance, we need to spend a lot more time talking about the
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:45.040]   reasons that we are accumulating money and the reasons we're making the decisions we're
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.880]   doing rather than exclusively focusing on the numbers of zeros and dollars.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.160]   The end of your life, that's why basically I hope it came through, but at the end of
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:23:01.240]   your life, would you trade half a million dollars in net worth at the end of your life
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.720]   to have two more children?
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.840]   It's a serious question.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.840]   What is your ambition?
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.880]   Is your ambition to be 80 years old and have an additional half a million dollars in net
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:14.920]   worth or would you rather be 80 years old and have an additional two children and maybe
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.320]   an additional eight grandchildren, et cetera?
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.600]   The answers to those questions need to drive your life now because money is the thing that's
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.400]   basically the easiest to solve.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.080]   There's always opportunities to go and work.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.680]   But if you're living in a culture that is unfriendly to children and you want to have
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.960]   children, then you're going to have conversations kind of like the one that we just had.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   I'll be back with you very soon.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.360]   I want you to go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult to book a personal consultee call with me
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.120]   and Patreon.com/RadicalPersonalFinance to be on next week's podcast.
