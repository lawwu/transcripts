[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   Now, as we come to the Word of God, I want to draw your attention back to the gospel
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.280]   of Mark.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.640]   Mark is one of four gospels, as you know: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.680]   The purpose of the four gospels is laid out in the end of John's gospel: "These things
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.760]   are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and believing
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.220]   might have life in His name."
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.180]   That fits both Mark and John, as well as Matthew and Luke.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.140]   That is the purpose of the four gospels: that you might know that Jesus is the Christ, the
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.760]   Son of God, and that believing you might have eternal life in His name.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.280]   So the goal of the gospels is to understand who Jesus is and to receive the eternal life
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.720]   that He alone can give.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.140]   And so, the gospel of Mark is a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.140]   And it's a very important part of the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:25.260]   Christ the Son of God, God the Son, one in nature with God, the eternal Son.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.540]   That's how Mark introduces Jesus: by His earthly name, His anointed title, Christ, or Messiah,
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.720]   and His divine identity as the Son of God.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   And Mark immediately launches into making that very clear and evident.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.840]   First of all, in chapter 1, verse 7, He introduces us to John the Baptist.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.820]   John the Baptist, by the words of our Lord Himself, was declared to be the greatest of
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.940]   the prophets, the greatest man who ever lived up until his time.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.360]   And yet he says concerning Jesus, verse 7, "After Me.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.580]   One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.120]   of His sandals.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.940]   I baptize you with water; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.420]   Here He affirms the deity of Christ as the one superior to even the greatest of all prophets,
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.840]   and the one who can dispense the very member of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, into the
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.000]   life of those saints.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   He says, "I will baptize you with water."
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.860]   That evidence of the person of Jesus Christ continues through these opening chapters.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.080]   In chapter 2, as you remember from our previous message, Jesus says to the paralytic, "Son,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.920]   your sins are forgiven."
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.740]   And the scribes who were there say, "He's blaspheming.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.980]   Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.860]   And so Jesus then heals the paralytic and gives evidence of the fact that He can forgive
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:29.500]   sin because He can heal, and only God can heal, so He as God can also forgive sin.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.640]   We find at the end of chapter 2 a very interesting statement: "The Son of Man is Lord of the
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.080]   Sabbath.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.960]   He is superior to the world."
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.020]   He is superior to the law.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.500]   Sabbath represents the law.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.620]   He is over the law.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.460]   He is above the prophets.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.020]   He is the Holy One of God.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:57.820]   The demons know it, and the people should know it by testimony of His miracles, which
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.600]   are laid out in these opening few chapters, and His power over Satan.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.940]   But interestingly enough, in these opening chapters, we don't have testimony.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.220]   We don't have testimony from any of the crowd.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.500]   Even though they were watching the miracles, seeing that He could cast out demons, there
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.060]   was no miracle too difficult for Him.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.960]   But there is no human confession.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.460]   That doesn't come until many chapters later.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.420]   Mark wants us to know that in spite of what the initial response to Christ was, the testimony
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.920]   is clear.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:48.460]   He is the Son of God, as the angel said He was when He introduced Mary to that child
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.260]   she would bear.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.920]   The evidence of His divine nature is unmistakable.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.560]   In chapter 3, verse 11, "Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him," - and He was going from
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.900]   place to place and confronting them - "whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:16.400]   down before Him and shout, 'You are the Son of God!'"
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:24.140]   The forces of hell know He's the Son of God.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.060]   But still, you don't have any confession on the part of the people.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.120]   The crowd is there.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.020]   They're strung all through these opening chapters.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.880]   There were so many people that Jesus could hardly function.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.800]   And that's where we pick up the story in chapter 3, verse 20.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.080]   Chapter 3, verse 20.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:56.600]   Just after He had chosen His disciples, in verses 13 to 19, it says, "He came home."
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:04.120]   He had gone up, according to verse 13, to the mountain, summoned His disciples to basically
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.360]   get them established.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.860]   He needed the privacy.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:15.560]   And now He comes back home to Capernaum, to the house of Simon and Andrew, who were
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.920]   brothers.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.140]   That was His home base in His ministry in Galilee.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:31.720]   He came home, and the crowd gathered again to such an extent that they could not even
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.520]   eat a meal.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.840]   Mobs of people around Him.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.420]   We saw that, didn't we, in the case of the paralytic, because they couldn't get Him to
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.420]   Jesus.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.900]   They took the roof apart to lower Him.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:58.740]   This introduces us to an amazing encounter with Jesus that I want you to understand.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.900]   It's very, very definitive, and it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.900]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.900]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.900]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.900]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.900]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.820]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.820]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.820]   And it will help us understand how to understand Christ.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.000]   And it will help us understand how to identify Him.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.580]   You have only three options, and we'll show you that from this text.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:26.920]   But let me start with the one option you don't have when it comes to Jesus, and the one that
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.960]   most people would affirm.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:38.800]   It would be this: Jesus is a good man, a religious man, a spiritual man, a gifted
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:47.920]   teacher, a great preacher, a wise man, a moral leader, a virtuous example.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:10:01.040]   I mean, that is generally the typical favorable view of Jesus that is just generally purveyed.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.360]   He's a good man, a good teacher, a wise man.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.780]   Even Islam says that, a prophet.
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.380]   But you don't have that option.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.760]   That is not at all a possible option.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.920]   You say, "Why?"
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   For one particular reason: Jesus said He was God.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   Did you get that?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.900]   He said He was God.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.340]   I and the Father are one.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.220]   If you've seen Me, you've seen the Father.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.760]   I do what the Father does.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:45.380]   He made claims to be God.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.720]   He said before Abraham was, "I am."
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.540]   He declared Himself to be the I AM, the Eternal One.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.760]   That eliminated the possibility that He's a good teacher, because good teachers don't
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.660]   say they're God; crazy people do.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.740]   This is not a possibility.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:15.540]   He claimed to be God in human flesh.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.200]   He claimed to be eternal.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:30.120]   He claimed to have the same nature as God, the same will as God, the same power as God.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:38.140]   Good teachers, wise men, truth-tellers, moral leaders don't claim to be God.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.720]   So we'll eliminate that.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.440]   We'll eliminate that as a possibility.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:48.280]   And that wipes out all the pandering, liberal views of Jesus that put Him in that category.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.480]   You don't have that option.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.080]   There are three possibilities, and they are laid out in this text.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:07.560]   Here are your three options: one, He was delusional; two, He was demonic; or three, He was divine.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.700]   Those are the only options.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.320]   And they play out in this wonderful text.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:25.080]   Let's consider the first one: that Jesus was delusional, that He was deranged mentally,
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:37.440]   that He was in some way insane, out of His mind, a lunatic; and we come to that option
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.680]   right away in Matthew.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.340]   In verse 21, Jesus had come back to Capernaum.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.920]   The crowds were there again.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   They couldn't even eat a meal.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.540]   There were such crushing crowds.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:57.960]   And then verse 21: "When His own people heard of this" - what do you mean, "His own people"?
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:08.660]   Literally those of Him, His family, His family - "when they heard of this, they went after Him."
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:17.820]   "They went out to take custody of Him, for they were saying, 'He has lost his senses.'"
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.660]   He's delusional.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:32.400]   That was the attitude of Jesus' family, that He was mentally off.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.960]   He comes back to His base in Capernaum.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.640]   The crowds are all there.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.820]   They're interfering.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.220]   They're overwhelming Him.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:51.460]   He pulls away, in verses 13 and following, to spend some time getting the disciples going.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.100]   He comes back in verse 20, and there the crowd is again.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.520]   And why are they there?
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.440]   Because He could cast out demons and heal all diseases.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.400]   That's why they were there.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.620]   They dogged His steps because they wanted the miracle.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:15.140]   They wanted the deliverance.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:22.780]   And then His family hears about it, that He's back.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:31.620]   And so they went to essentially to do an intervention, to use contemporary lingo.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.940]   They have to go get Him.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.600]   What it says in verse 21 actually is, "They went to the temple of the Lord, and they went
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.400]   to take custody of Him."
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.200]   Literally they went to seize Him.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.540]   This was not going to be a conversation.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.400]   This was going to be a severe intervention.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.180]   His family was embarrassed.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:15:02.580]   His family was fearful for His well-being, and they thought He had lost His mind.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:08.580]   Thirty years of living in that home.
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.880]   In Nazareth, that relatively small village.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.240]   Thirty years of quiet.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.520]   Thirty years of silence as far as ministry is concerned.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.560]   There's only one occasion do we know anything about those thirty years, and that was when
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.960]   He was twelve years of age, and He went to Jerusalem with His family, and He was asking
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.260]   some theological questions in the temple.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:38.560]   There's no record of any teaching or any miracles of any kind for thirty years.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.400]   He, in a sense, blended in to the simple life of Nazareth.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.840]   But understand this: He was still the Son of God.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:16:02.240]   He was holy, perfect, righteous, but unknown, but known to His family, known to His mother,
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   and she knew the truth about Him from the beginning, because she heard it from Gabriel
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.540]   as we read earlier.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:18.100]   She knew the truth, and she pondered it in her heart.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:24.020]   But the rest of the family - Joseph now is gone, he disappears very soon in the accounts
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.220]   of the gospel, so he no doubt had died.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:36.480]   And you have the brothers and sisters in the family, and they, even with their mother's
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.520]   testimony.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:46.040]   Or of their father's testimony they heard concerning the birth of their half-brother,
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.060]   they thought he was a man.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.340]   That is a positive in one sense.
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.140]   His humanity was so real.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:08.040]   His humanity was so complete and comprehensive, he was so truly human that his family couldn't
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.500]   believe that he was a man.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:17.840]   He was also truly divine, even in the face of his perfections.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:27.300]   Even though he never sinned, was wholly harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, they might
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:37.640]   have thought he was odd, but they didn't think he was God.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.480]   They thought he had lost his mind.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.800]   That his rational capabilities had failed him.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.360]   Because no sane person would say, "I'm God."
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.320]   Crazy people say that.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:01.860]   So they went to take him captive for his own sake and theirs.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:08.460]   The term to take custody of him is literally to seize.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.460]   It's a term that's used in the Bible.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.460]   It's used three times in Mark.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:16.220]   Eight times it was about seizing Jesus, including His arrest.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:23.820]   It's also a verb that was used when John the Baptist was arrested in the sixth chapter.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:29.940]   So this is an intervention to capture one that they cared about, one that they no doubt
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:38.440]   loved, who is in danger because of his lunacy, because he's out of his mind.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:46.960]   And by the way, John, chapter 7, verse 5 says, "His brothers didn't believe in Him."
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.960]   Point blank.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.760]   His brothers were not believing in Him.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:19:02.120]   If you look over at the sixth chapter of Mark for just a moment, Jesus came into His hometown
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   of Nazareth, in verse 1, with His disciples.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.060]   This is back in His hometown.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.960]   When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and the many listeners were
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.560]   astonished saying, "Where did this man get these things?
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.940]   And what is this wisdom given to Him?
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.120]   And such miracles as these performed by His hands?
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:35.560]   Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joseph, and Judas,
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.040]   and Simon?
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.100]   Are not His sisters?
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.580]   Are not His ministers here with us?"
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.280]   They took offense at Him.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.460]   This is just the carpenter.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.160]   This is the son of Mary.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.940]   Joseph's not mentioned, as I said, no doubt had died.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.400]   We know His brothers.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.020]   We know His sisters.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:08.080]   They took offense at the notion that He was claiming to be God.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.020]   They took offense at the notion that He was claiming to be God.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   Joseph's not mentioned.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.020]   He's not mentioned in the Gospel.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.020]   He's not mentioned in the Gospel.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.020]   He's not mentioned in the Scripture.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.020]   He's not mentioned in the Bible.

[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:14.740]   He was a blasphemer, but he was forgiven.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:20.840]   All sin, including blasphemy, can be forgiven.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:31.880]   But - verse 29 - whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, never
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.220]   has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.000]   Because they were saying, "He's not forgiven."
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.640]   He has an unclean spirit.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.000]   Here's the point: after all Jesus had said, after all He had done, after the display of
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.620]   miracle power and power over demons, they came to a final conclusion: He has an unclean
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.620]   spirit.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:39:00.240]   He is satanic, and He needs to be destroyed.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.700]   And what our Lord is saying is if that's your final conclusion, you can never be forgiven.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.980]   You end up there.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:18.940]   You end up after the Spirit of God has demonstrated who Christ is by His power, His teaching, and
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:33.100]   you conclude that He's satanic, you can never be forgiven, because you've concluded it with
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.260]   the evidence in your face.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:37.960]   Because everything you've done is satanic.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   You've done it in your face.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   You've done it in your life.

[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   You've done it in your life.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:42:00.320]   Verse 4, Hebrews 6: "In the case of those who have once been enlightened, and have
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:08.820]   tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:14.900]   tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come."
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.960]   None of those phrases has to do with salvation.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.940]   None of them is ever used anywhere in Scripture.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.500]   They're never used anywhere in Scripture to refer to salvation.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:32.560]   This is talking about being enlightened, concerning Christ, getting a taste of heavenly
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:40.300]   power, experiencing the Holy Spirit's power by listening to Christ, seeing His miracles,
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:46.940]   even being healed by Him, or delivered by Him, or fed by Him as He created food.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.600]   You've been enlightened.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.920]   You have been saved.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.720]   You have tasted.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.620]   You have been a partaker.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.940]   You've even tasted the good word of God from the lips of Jesus.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.760]   And you've even tasted the powers of the age to come, miracle power, kingdom power that
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.720]   will be unleashed in its fullness in the glory of the millennial kingdom.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.100]   You've had a taste of all of that.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:19.460]   If you fall away at that point, if you don't conclude that Jesus is who He said He was,
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:28.580]   it's impossible to renew you again to repentance, because you've had the full revelation.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:38.140]   And if with the full revelation your conclusion was that He is to be rejected, then there's
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.140]   no hope for you.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.880]   Why?
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.260]   Because you essentially have crucified to yourself the Son of God and put Him to open
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.260]   shame.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.900]   Ultimately, it's what you do with Jesus Christ.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.680]   But what you do with Jesus Christ will be determined by whether or not you think the
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:05.280]   power under which He operated was the Holy Spirit or hell itself.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.000]   Should be obvious.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.780]   Should be obvious.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.700]   You can speak a word against the Son of Man and be forgiven; you can speak a word against
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.240]   the Father and be forgiven.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.620]   But if you reject the testimony of the Spirit of God and His whole purpose was to point
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:32.420]   to Christ, if you reject His testimony, there's no way to repentance.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:39.080]   Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit with regard to his testimony concerning Christ
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.900]   is guilty of an eternal sin.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.400]   You say, "Does that apply to us?"
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.620]   Well, not in the sense that we were alive when Christ was here, but in the sense that
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.700]   the Spirit of God wrote Scripture, right?
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:59.120]   So the Scripture is the testimony of the Holy Spirit to Christ, and it's a sufficient testimony
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:03.560]   to lead you to the right conclusion.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:08.380]   You read the account of Christ in the New Testament; it doesn't lead you to conclude
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.820]   that He's delusional.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.660]   It doesn't lead you to conclude that He's demonic.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:17.600]   It leads you to conclude that He's divine, because that is the Spirit's intention.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:26.640]   An eternal sin that can never be forgiven to make the wrong evaluation of Christ.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:35.600]   But for those who follow the influence of the Holy Spirit, written on the pages of Scripture
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.420]   - that's why we have the full record of His life repeated four times - for those of us
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:47.580]   who see this and understand it and affirm His divinity, we have eternal life.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:57.260]   If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead,
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:02.620]   you shall be saved.
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.520]   That's the right option.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   - 1 Thessalonians 3:20-21.
