[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   David writes in from Little Rock, Arkansas.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   "Pastor John, how would you share the message of Christian hedonism,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   that we exist to glorify God by enjoying Him forever,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   from a single passage of Scripture with a co-worker or a fellow college student
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   over a 30-minute lunch meeting? Where would you go?"
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I'd go to Pizza Hut.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   [Laughter]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Oh, that's not what you meant.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I would go to Philippians, first to Pizza Hut, with a Bible or an iPad
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and a napkin and a pen to write on, and I would go to Philippians 1, 20 to 23.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Here's what it says.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   "It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not at all be ashamed,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   but that with full courage now as always Christ will be magnified in my body."
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   So now that's one piece of what I want, because part of that statement is
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   God is most glorified in me when I'm most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   So here I've got Christ being magnified.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   That's what He wants, Christ magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Then he says, verse 21, "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Now I'd stop right there and get my friend to talk with me about gain here.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   What does he mean when he says to die is gain?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Tell me, what do you think he means?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And he would probably say something like, at least I would tell him this is what I think it means,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   "Paul believes that when he dies he's going to be more satisfied than when he lives."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Right? Doesn't it say that?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So if you die and it's gain, that means in the two columns of gain and loss,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   if you put everything that this life has to offer in one column and you put death in the other column,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   he says the death column is gain, which must mean he values something on the other side of death
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   more than he values all this stuff here, and it's more satisfying, and then you'd ask, "What is that?"
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And then you'd read the rest of the text.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Verse 22, "If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I'm hard-pressed between the two.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   My desire is to depart," okay, die, "and be with Christ."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Now there's the answer to the question, "What could be gain if everything in this life is lost?"
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And his answer is Christ.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So I would put the language of satisfaction on that.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'd say, "Doesn't that mean that Paul is saying to die is gain,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   that is, to die means I will experience a superior satisfaction on the other side,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   namely because Jesus is there, face to face, more intimate than here?"
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And if I could get him to agree with that, then we'd go back to verse 20 and get the logic.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So it says, "It is my eager expectation and hope that Christ will be magnified, glorified, made much of."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We could linger over that for a little bit.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   "Christ would be glorified in my body, whether by death, for to die is gain."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And I would just say, "Now talk to me about that."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I'm trying to get him to give me what I see here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   He says, "Christ will be magnified by my death because to me to die is gain."
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And we've already said that the gain is finding Christ more satisfying than everything in this world.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So wouldn't the paraphrase be, "Christ is magnified in my body when I die,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   if I experience Christ in dying as supremely satisfying."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And then I would collapse it further and say, "Doesn't that say Christ is magnified
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   when I am satisfied in Christ?"
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I hope he'd say, "Well, yeah, that's what it says."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And then I would say, "Here's my rose story."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I take flowers to my wife. I ring the doorbell. She looks at me.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I say, "Happy Anniversary, Noel." And she says, "Oh, they're beautiful, Johnny. Why did you?"
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And I say, "It's my duty." And she's not happy with that answer.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Instead, I run the video again. I ring the doorbell. She looks at them.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   "Oh, Johnny, they're beautiful. Why did you?" And I say, "Because I can't help it.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I love buying flowers for you. In fact, I've got a plan for the evening
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and we're going to go out on the town because there's nothing I'd rather do
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   than spend the evening with you."
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Not a million years would she say, "Nothing you'd rather do than go out with me."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That's all you ever think about is you, you, you. What would satisfy you, you, you?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   She would never say that. Why? Because when I say, "Nothing would make me happier
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   than to be with you tonight," she feels honored, glorified, magnified.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And the more satisfied in her I am, the more glorified she feels by me.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And therefore, we operate on this principle all day long when we're thinking clearly.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So I'd go to Philippians 1, 20 to 23, and I'd tell my rose story.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   At Pizza Hut.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   At Pizza Hut. Over a personal pan with a diet coke.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, this passage in Philippians 1 appears all over everything Pastor John produces.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But in another APJ episode, it played an interesting role in answering the question,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   "Is it selfish for me to pray for joy?"
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That's episode number 147. Be sure to check that out.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And like David did, please email your questions into us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org

[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I'm your host Tony Ranke. We'll see you tomorrow.
