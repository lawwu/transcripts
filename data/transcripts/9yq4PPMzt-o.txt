[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Michael writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, is it possible for a husband to lust after his own wife?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   So is that a sin even possible within the marriage relationship?"
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Well, I wish I had Michael here to just ask him more precisely what he has in mind by lusting after his wife.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   So let me go at it from a Bible text and then circle around maybe and guess at what Michael might have in his mind
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and do the best to answer his question.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Here's a relevant text, and it may be a little confusing because the translations differ here,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and I'm going to opt for a more unusual one.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I'm thinking of 1 Thessalonians 4, 3 through 5.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Here's my translation. Well, I'll give both, ESV and mine, or NIV. They're all the same pretty much.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   "For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   that each one of you"--now here comes the controversial part--
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   "that each one of you know how to"--ESV--"control his own body in holiness and honor."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Now the issue is the word behind "body" is "vessel." That's the literal translation, "vessel."
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So it's either "possess," "obtain," or "control his own vessel."
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So there are two possibilities. One, he's talking about his wife, his own vessel,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   and that's the one I'm opting for because in 1 Peter 3, 7 it says,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   "Live together with your wife and honor her as the weaker vessel."
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   That's the word that's used here.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Or it could be your own self, your own sexual organ, the vessel.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So which is it? It's a wonderful truth both ways.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   But if you go with "vessel" as "wife," which is what I'm doing here, then it reads something like this.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   "Each one of you should know how to possess or have a wife in holiness and honor,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   not in passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Which means there is a sinful way to treat your wife in sexual relations.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And that's why I chose this verse.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And of course that would be true even if this translation were different.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So let me just work on that for just a minute.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   There is a dishonorable and unholy way to deal with your wife sexually.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Every Christian husband should have his wife's desires and his wife's pleasures in mind
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   when he thinks about sexual relations and when he does sexual relations.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And of course she should do the same.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   In other words, he doesn't just barge in there and do whatever he feels like doing
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   with no reverence to what does this woman delight in, what does she enjoy, what would please her.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   There's this happy competition.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Who can make the other most happy?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Who can outdo the other in showing honor?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Like 1 Corinthians 7, 3.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, likewise the wife to her husband.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The wife's body does not belong to her, but also to her husband.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And the same way the husband's body does not belong to him alone, but to his wife.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So they're both competing to be the servant of the other's maximum pleasure.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And that's really remarkable.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   What an amazing competition in marriage.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   The man does not use his headship.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   This is not a compromise of headship.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   This is telling a man, you don't use your headship here to be demanding.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Use your headship to create.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You're an initiative taker to create situations of the greatest possible mutual joy.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's what headship is here.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   So back to the question.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Can you lust after your own wife?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   If you're governed by this approach to love and honor and holiness in a sexual relationship,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I don't think it's wrong for a husband to want his wife sexually
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and to think about having her and hold her in his mind the way he would hold her in bed.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   So if that's what he's thinking about, can you entertain in your mind thoughts about sexual delights with your wife?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I think the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   There's no sin in your mind that wouldn't be sin in your bed.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   What would be sin is if a husband imagined sin or desired sin or took on attitudes to his wife in his heart,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   that would be wrong in the bedroom.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So I think it's right for a husband to enjoy his wife anyway in the mind.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   That would be right to enjoy her in the bed.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And it just closes with this stunning thing.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's just kind of out of the blue, but just so amazing.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I can't leave it unsaid.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   The stunning thing in all of this is that this is a picture of Christ and the church.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Like, are you kidding me?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That Paul would say that this cherishing, this nurturing, this delighting, this pleasuring,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   is a portrait, a drama of Christ's relationship to his bride.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   We should be amazed that our Savior chose to describe his relationship with his church with a parable of such exquisite pleasure.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And people say theology is boring.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
