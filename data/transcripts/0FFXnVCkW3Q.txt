[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   We close out the week on the Ask Pastor John podcast with a question from a female listener
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.920]   who writes in and asks this, "Good morning Pastor John.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.800]   I'm reading your powerful book, Don't Waste Your Life.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.200]   In chapter seven, living to prove he is more precious than life, under the section titled
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.400]   Consumed with Clothes, you write this, "My plea is that you be more like a dolphin and
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.240]   less like a jellyfish in the sea of fashion and of contra-fashion, which is just as tyrannizing."
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.000]   Could you explain more of what you are saying in this sentence?
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.160]   Well, let's do it in two parts, the dolphin part and the fashion, contra-fashion part.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.960]   First, I love the dolphin, jellyfish analogy.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.480]   The assumption is that oceans of culture have very powerful tides, and these cultural tides
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.800]   almost always pull us away from deep allegiance to Jesus.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.520]   So if you're going to swim in the cultural oceans and be a Christian, you better be a
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.000]   dolphin, not a jellyfish, because a jellyfish just goes with the flow, and dolphins can
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.040]   cut through the tidal currents and swim toward the truth and swim toward holiness and toward
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.160]   heaven in spite of cultural tides.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.280]   And of course, there's no if about it.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.100]   If we're going to live in these cultural tides, no, there's no if about it.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.200]   We don't have any choice.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.000]   We do swim in the cultural oceans of this planet.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.040]   To be alive is to be in a culture shaped by the world.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.400]   So Jesus prayed in John 17, 15, "I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.800]   that you keep them from the evil one."
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.200]   So he was very aware, "My disciples are stuck there, and they need help.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.760]   They need protection.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.440]   They need to be able to swim like a dolphin."
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   The New Testament calls us to dolphin-like countercultural efforts over and over again.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   Here are a few examples.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.040]   Romans 12, 2, "Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   of your mind."
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.440]   Ephesians 4, 17, "You must no longer walk as the Gentiles do in the futility of their
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.520]   minds."
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.480]   James 4, 4, "Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.960]   For whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God."
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.600]   First Peter 1, 18, "You were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers."
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   First John 2, 15, "Do not love the world or the things that are in the world.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.620]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.620]   And so on.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.680]   So that's what I mean by being a dolphin, being so full of Holy Spirit joy, Holy Spirit
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.800]   courage, Holy Spirit wisdom, that you have the strength and the wherewithal to swim against
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   the current of the culture.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.920]   That's what it takes to be a Christian.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.320]   Another name for dolphin in the New Testament is exile and sojourner.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.180]   Beloved, this is First Peter 2, 11, "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles, dolphins,
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.120]   to abstain from the passions of the flesh which wage war against your soul."
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.020]   That tide is taking you down there to be eaten by the sharks if you don't swim against this
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.100]   tide heavenward.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.780]   We have a homing device within us called new birth and the Holy Spirit against these cultural
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.600]   tides taking us home.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:09.000]   Now there is another side to this, namely Christianity does not destroy earthly culture
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.920]   even when it is rightly being embedded in it.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.620]   It transforms it but doesn't destroy it.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.240]   So it adapts to a hundred things in the culture.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.880]   Most real Christians in the West drive cars, use cell phones, live in houses, wear the
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.100]   clothes that look more or less like everybody else around them, and so on.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.860]   We fit in in that sense.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.080]   And the New Testament makes clear that this is so, and this is right, and it does it in
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.120]   several ways.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.140]   One is the great battle over circumcision.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.960]   Is circumcision going to be required as these Gentiles with their pagan uncircumcision going
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.820]   to fit into this largely Jewish church?
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.960]   Has the decision was finally made?
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   No.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.200]   That cultural demand is not going to be made.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.400]   Paul said, "I become all things to all people that I might save some."
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.960]   So those are a couple of pointers.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.920]   The fact that we are a people who always have two impulses at work, like Andrew Wall says.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.440]   There's the pilgrim principle, that's like exiles and aliens here, and indigenous principle,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   which means we do adapt.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.040]   We don't require neutral things to be shifted around in order to be a part of the Christian
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   community.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:40.400]   Now, the other part that this listener may have been talking about is what I meant by
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.040]   fashion and contra-fashion.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.320]   And I'm not sure that's what they wanted me to talk about, or whether it was just the
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320]   dolphin.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.800]   I don't know, but I'm going to make a go at it anyway.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.440]   They said, "My plea is that you," they're quoting me, "My plea is that you would be
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.680]   more like a dolphin, less like a jellyfish in the sea of fashion and of contra-fashion,"
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.280]   which is just as tyrannizing.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.600]   And they want to know, "What do you mean by that?"
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.400]   I think.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:19.880]   And I simply mean both men and women today are pressured in dozens of ways to conform
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:27.200]   to the way the world dresses and thinks about dressing or about makeup or about hair.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.280]   It's becoming even stronger and stronger for men.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.360]   I was jogging this morning on Washington Avenue at five o'clock in the morning, and I passed
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.040]   this big glass front of the new building called Men's Spa.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.160]   And the title is "Ultimate Male Grooming."
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.480]   I thought, "Really?
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.200]   Sounds like a dog."
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.920]   I'm just saying that to say we usually think about women when it's pressured to dress a
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:02.240]   certain way, but more and more I think male grooming is a pressured thing.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.080]   So can a woman find, here's the kind of pressure she might be under.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:15.160]   Can a woman find a fashion in stores that she feels comfortable with on some items?
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.520]   I've talked to mothers who find it difficult shopping with their young daughters because
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.680]   there's scarcely a choice out there for one that she or the mom or both would feel good
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.600]   about in terms of modesty.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.320]   And what I mean by contra-fashion is that a person can be driven by what is so popular
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.640]   or can be driven by what is not popular.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.840]   There's a whole culture luring people to conform to non-conformity.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.040]   How else can you explain the manufacture of jeans with holes in them?
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.140]   I mean, the manufacture of jeans that are tattered with holes.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.280]   What is that?
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.080]   This is the mainstreaming of contra-fashion, which of course will lead to a contra-contra
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.220]   fashion and so on.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.940]   The point that I was trying to get at was you can be a jellyfish by craving to look
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.340]   preppy or you can be a jellyfish by craving to look anti-preppy.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:22.460]   Either way, I mean, you're not free when you conform to all your grunge friends.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.460]   It's not freedom.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.060]   It's just rebellion in a new conformity.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.420]   So thumbing your nose at culture may feel like a dolphin, but you may wake up and find
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:39.300]   you're just a jellyfish like all the others floating with a million others not so radical
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.420]   grunge lovers.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.820]   So I think the best text for men and women, men and women, even though it's written for
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.940]   women in the New Testament is 1 Peter 3, 4, and 5.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.900]   I've been memorizing 1 Peter and this is really powerful for men, for me, as well as women.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.340]   It says, "Do not let your adorning," these men can say grooming, "Do not let your grooming
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.120]   or your adorning be external.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.380]   The braiding of hair, the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear."
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:16.660]   Now pause there and note, he cannot mean braids per se are wrong, jewelry per se is wrong
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.740]   because if he did, he'd have to mean clothing per se is wrong because the last one is just
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.740]   clothing.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.340]   Don't let your adorning be clothing.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.340]   Oh, really?
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.720]   Well, what do you mean by that?
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.220]   It means what he says in the next line.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:36.860]   He says, "But let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:43.900]   beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.180]   In other words, for men and women, the focus and the drive and the craving shouldn't be,
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.300]   "I want to look a certain way, I want to look a certain way, but I want to be a certain
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.300]   way.
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:00.860]   I want to be beautiful in my spirit of humility and kindness and love and gentleness and meekness
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.580]   and self-control."
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:11.820]   So for men and women, put your energy, let's put our energy into becoming a holy, wise,
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:20.140]   loving, courageous, Christ-exalting people on the inside, a dolphin from the inside.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:27.180]   And the fashion, I think, will take its appropriate secondary place.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.700]   Wonderful Pastor John, thank you.
