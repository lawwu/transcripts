[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Okay, let's let's try to one more question, Jesse, what do we got here?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Okay, the next question we got is about deep procrastination with students and non students.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Hi, Cal, what advice would you give to people grappling with deep procrastination? And specifically,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   how does that advice change between students and professionals? I work with both. And I
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   think knowing how you would approach the question differently between students and professionals
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   might give some additional insight into the idea. Thanks.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   All right, so deep procrastination is an interesting, complicated topic. So deep procrastination
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   is a term I coined back in those halcyon days of my study hacks blog, and we all were just
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   writing for RSS feeds. And I was mainly doing student advice. And it described the phenomenon
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   that I would see frequently, which would be undergraduates at these elite schools. So
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I was at MIT at the time, but I would also work with some students at Harvard and other
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   nearby schools, students at elite schools, losing their capability of doing schoolwork,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   like completely losing the capability to the point where they would have to do leaves of
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   absences, right? Because it would be your final paper is due and you just couldn't do
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   it. And your professor say, Okay, well, look, I'll give you a week extension. And you just
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   want to do a lick of work, like you just lost the ability to do schoolwork. And I called
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   that deep, deep procrastination. And typically, where that came from for students was a fritzing
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   out or a burning out of the their cognitive motivational systems. And so you usually would
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   have two ingredients would come together to cause this extrinsic motivation. So they were
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   just high achievers, just you gotta get good grades, grind for grades, you know, to get
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   the good college grind for grades, like do three majors and take on all these clubs and
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   grind through so you'll be impressive so you can get the right job. Just kind of like
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   extrinsic motivation of just my family and town think I'm talented, and I got to do
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   impressive things. So it's not coming deeply from an intrinsic place of extrinsic
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   motivation. And then you combine it with difficulty, like, is this hard? Like this, this
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   cognitive toil, like the work is just really hard. You're doing a lot of you have a lot
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   of majors, a lot of clubs, it's really mentally demanding, you're at MIT, trying to do two
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   majors, and it's really difficult, right? When those two things come together, extrinsic
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   motivation, plus a consistent toil, cognitive toil, you can fritz out the system, and your
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   mind's like, no more, no mas, we're not going to work anymore. And that would cause deep
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   procrastination. It's important to try to differentiate this from depression. They're
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   similar, but it's not quite the same thing. So with depression, it's much more broad in
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   its impact. So with with depression, which also, of course, is common among students,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   especially at these elite schools, you go a hedonic, so you can't imagine finding pleasure
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   or happiness in anything. That's why depression is so insidious. Deep procrastination is
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   more focused. Like you're still other things in your life you're really into, you just
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   like can't do the schoolwork. In fact, there might be things you really love doing. You're
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   like, I don't know, I'm reading instead and going to these movies, and why am I even in
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   school? And you still have motivation, and you still can find pleasure in life, you just
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   can't do schoolwork. Whereas depression is more of a fritzing out of the entire ability
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to have optimism or hope or feel like you're ever going to enjoy anything ever again. And
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   depression tends to come more from, you go through a period of heavy negative self-talk
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and rumination. So there's sort of a different path to depression that you're down on yourself,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   down on yourself, obsessing over like things going on in your life that are bad, and that
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   conversation was bad, and I'm bad. And again, there's overlap here, but it's typically fritz
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   out your, the pleasure centers, the ability to have any happiness or optimism gets fritzed
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   out by heavy rumination, where deep procrastination was very specifically schoolwork. Again, they
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   can overlap. If you're depressed, you're not going to do schoolwork. But if you have optimism
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and enjoy things in your life, just can't do the schoolwork, that's deep procrastination.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   All right, so they're two different things. When it was clearly deep procrastination for
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   students, the key was to reduce both of those instigating factors. Extrinsic motivation,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   large cognitive toil, it's just physically really demanding the cognitive work you're
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   trying to do. So this is where I started writing about, at first, the Zen valedictorian philosophy
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   on my blog, and then later, the romantic scholar philosophy, which was all about taking your
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   college career, moving the locus of control from the extrinsic end of the spectrum back
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   to the intrinsic, so you take back control of what you're studying and why, and then
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   reducing, changing, and modifying your approach to the schoolwork so it's not nearly as, it's
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   not a toil, so you get rid of that negative affect, the friction of actually doing the
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   work, you make your work easier. Intrinsic motivation make the work easier. Deep procrastination
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   goes away, because those are the two things that cause it. Now again, if it's depression,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   you need clinical help, there's a whole different way you deal with depression, but if it's
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   just deep procrastination, that would be my cure for people who had it, it would also
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   be my preventative for people who worried about it. And this is where I would have people,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   for example, take control over what they major in, and I didn't care how they made the decision,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   but just so it was theirs, and not their parents, or not something I think would impress their
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   aunts and uncles at the family reunions. This is where I would get the students to be very
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   heavy on lifestyle-centric career planning, where they put out a vision of their life
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   one year after college, five years after college, 15 years after college, that resonates with
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   them deeply. I live here, this is what my days are like, here's the role of work, here's
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   the activities I'm involved with, like they can taste and feel and smell what this lifestyle
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   is like. And then they're working backwards from that to figure out, what should I be
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   doing in school now to help move me closer to that? So now you do those things, now it's
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   intrinsic motivation. The work you're doing is part of this vision you created that resonates
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   with you, motivation's intrinsic. Now to get rid of the overwhelming just toil of the work,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I say, and again, I tell these students again and again, get rid of all these stupid majors,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   get rid of all these stupid activities. You have this mindset that somehow there's going
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   to be an admissions officer in your future that's going to say, this looks like a really
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   hard schedule. You are very impressive for doing that hard schedule. You get to have
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   this job. I would tell them, no one cares. Like, where'd you go to school? What'd you
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   major in? What are your grades? That's about all I care about. So get rid of all these
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   majors, just have one major. Make your schedule easy. Complement the required courses for
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   your major with very different style of courses and easy courses. If you have all these, like
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   all these kids did, advanced standing credits from AP courses or whatever, use them to take
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   less courses. Do independent studies, like make your schedule easy so you have more than
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   enough time to work. I used to go give talks at colleges back in the day where I had this
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   student named Tov and he was my case study. And I would show his calendar because he used
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   the time machine function on his Mac to go back and show me a calendar from a typical
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   day and it was full of junk. He had all these majors and activities. He was so stressed
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   out. And I would tell the story about how he ended up drastically simplifying his life.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And I would cut to his current calendar. And it went from a kaleidoscope of colored
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   appointments to mainly white space. Course, course, low schedule, basically no extracurricular
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   jobs. And how he just came alive once he had breathing room. And so I would say you make
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   your life easier. And then once you have more than enough time to handle the work you're
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   doing, use good time management, use good study techniques. You're spreading it out.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   You're not staying up late. You feel like you can easily control it. And then I have
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   people invest, okay, go to talks, buy books, like get really into your major subject so
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   that your mind begins to think about this as something you care about. And it's not
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   just a means to an end. You do all these things. You don't worry about deep procrastination.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And so that was deep procrastination for students. That was its cause. That was my suggestion.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   The same thing applies, I think, for the professional world. And again, we differentiate
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   between depression and deep procrastination. In the professional world, deep procrastination
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   is, hey, I run this company and I just can't do the work. I know this thing is due. I got
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   to get this report to the client. I got to whatever. I just can't do it. But I have all
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   these other plans and I'm daydreaming about what I wish I could do instead. And I'm
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   daydreaming. I'm reading a lot of Tim Ferriss. And like, this is all a sign that it's deep
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   procrastination, not depression. Okay, so what do you have to do? You got to solve those
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   two problems. So you got to get the motivation back to intrinsic, which means what's your
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   lifestyle centric career vision, work backwards and reshape your working life to be aimed
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   towards that. Now you're in control to get rid of the toil. The biggest cause of toil
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   for professional jobs is chronic overload. You have more on your plate than you can easily
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   imagine getting done. If you go back and watch my core idea video on slow productivity, you
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   can find it youtube.com/calnewportmedia. I'll get into this. But basically, if you have
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   chronic overload, it's a huge drain on your brain. So do less, take stuff off your plate,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   switch from push the pole, I will pull something new on my plate when I'm ready for it. You
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   can't just push on my plate, drastically change your work if you have to so that you have
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   a reasonable amount of stuff to work on at any one time. Get rid of the chronic overload
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and then apply good habits, time block planning, weekly planning, quarterly planning, full
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   capture, organized to do systems, the low hanging fruit to get rid of that extra friction.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Do those things. So your work is now oriented towards a vision that you believe in and resonates
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   and you reduce the actual difficulty of your work by getting rid of overload and being
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   smart about your habits. That's how you get back. That's how you get around deep procrastination.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   The same thing that worked for students, I think works really well for professionals.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So I'm glad you asked this question because I think it's a really interesting impact.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It gets confused with other mental health issues, but it's very focused and I think it has a
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   really clear solution. And so I'm glad to have a chance to actually review those ideas.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   [MUSIC]
