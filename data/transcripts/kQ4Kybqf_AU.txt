[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Happy Monday and welcome back to the podcast. Well, Mondays are notoriously difficult for
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.720]   pastors. The Monday blues, as they're called, can set in after giving ones a life and soul
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.460]   on Sunday. And if you're not a pastor, I would encourage you to pray for your pastor today.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.400]   Pray for them every Monday. And all of this is compounded. All of these pressures compound
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.480]   for pastors who struggle with tensions inside of a local church leadership structure, which
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.160]   of course then breeds tension in a marriage and in a family. And it all leads to a question
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.400]   from an anonymous wife of a discouraged pastor. Pastor John, I really appreciate the Ask Pastor
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.120]   John podcast. It's one of my favorite things to listen to when I'm walking or doing the
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.160]   dishes or folding laundry. So thank you. I write to you as a discouraged pastor's wife.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.140]   My husband and I have been in full-time youth ministry for four years now, and it breaks
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.200]   my heart to say it, but I feel almost fed up with ministry. My husband gets very frustrated
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.140]   and discouraged at times. I submit to his leading in our family and his call to ministry,
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.600]   but I am so discouraged. The last year has been really difficult for us, my husband,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.880]   our marriage, our family. My husband looks so defeated some days, it breaks my heart.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.340]   We receive difficult criticism from church members, and I have a hard time not taking
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.800]   the criticism personally. Some of these people are our dear friends, and it's hard not to
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.880]   feel betrayed. Our church leadership remains fairly silent regarding the criticism and
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.720]   neither offers support nor guidance in how my husband can improve. I know we are not
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.440]   perfect by any means, but without guidance, we don't know what the church wants from us.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.780]   We feel alone. Can you offer any encouragement to us?
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.760]   My heart really goes out to this situation, this young couple, to pastors, especially
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.560]   younger pastors who are not in the lead pastor position but serve in supportive roles like
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.080]   youth pastor, because their fruitfulness and their joy are often dependent on patterns
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.760]   of leadership set by those who oversee them, and so they're more vulnerable than others
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:19.380]   are. So I have a special tender spot of concern that they have good leadership, not those
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.440]   who just ignore issues. So what might be helpful is three things. One is a testimony. Let me
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.640]   give a little testimony of my own discouragement six years into the ministry. Another is perhaps
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.360]   a series of diagnostic questions that might provide a way of reflecting on their situation,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.280]   and finally some encouragement from the Word. So here's the testimony. I had been at Bethlehem
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.000]   as the senior pastor for six years. I was now 40 years old at this point, which I do
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.320]   believe is an emotionally very vulnerable place for a man to be. There are real midlife
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:07.960]   issues, I think. And I wrote in my journal on November 6, 1986, these words. In fact,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.920]   you can read the whole thing by going to Desiring God and just searching for the article called
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.080]   How I Almost Quit. So here's part of what I said. "The church is looking for a vision
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.440]   for the future, and I do not have it. Does this mean that my time at Bethlehem is over?
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.880]   Does it mean that there is a radical alternative unforeseen by me? Does it mean that I am simply
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.000]   in the pits today and unable to feel the beauty and power and joy and fruitfulness of an expanded
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.480]   facility and ministry? O Lord, have mercy on me. I am so discouraged. I am so blank.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.720]   I feel like there are opponents on every hand. Even when I know that most of my people are
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.040]   for me, I am so blind to the future of the church. O Father, am I blind because it is
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.840]   not my future? Perhaps I shall not even live out the year, and you are sparing the church
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.920]   the added burden of a future I had made and couldn't complete. I do not doubt for a
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.040]   moment your goodness or power or omnipotence in my life or in the life of the church. I
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.760]   confess that the problem is mine, the weakness is mine, the blindness is in my eyes, the
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.480]   sin, O, reveal to me my hidden faults, is mine and mine the blame. Have mercy, Father,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.600]   have mercy on me. I must preach on Sunday, and I can scarcely lift my head." End of
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   quote. Now, as a matter of fact, I remained in that
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.760]   role for another 27 years, which is a warning against precipitous resignations when God
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:08.560]   may have something wonderful in store by persevering through seasons of blankness. He certainly
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.200]   did for me, and I'm so thankful he didn't let me go in both senses. He didn't let
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.120]   me leave the church and didn't let go of me. However, not all resignations, not all
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.960]   ministry changes are owing to cowardice or fear or laziness or a sense of failure. So
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:36.000]   let me give some diagnostic questions that might help this young couple discern what
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   the problem really is, because maybe a change in ministry is appropriate, maybe it's not.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.640]   Number one, is there a mismatch between your husband's spiritual gifts and the role he
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:56.960]   is being asked to fulfill? It's not a defeat or an act of disobedience if you discover
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.840]   that the role you are in calls for gifts you don't have. Such a mismatch may be painful
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.160]   to discover, but it doesn't have to be shameful. It's very difficult for us to make this
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.640]   call about ourselves. We need loving, honest, objective partners in ministry, and if they
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.220]   aren't there in the staff or in the church, then from outside. I think gifts for ministry
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:33.200]   are best discovered and best confirmed by others, not just ourselves. Others see more
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.400]   clearly than we at times whether our gifts are bearing any spiritual fruit or not, and
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.520]   what that fruit should be. So here's number two, the second diagnostic question. Is there
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.880]   a possible mismatch between the theology of your husband and the theology of the leadership?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.760]   Depending on how serious the differences are, this can be a deal-breaker in ongoing ministry.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:06.280]   How sweet when there's a theological camaraderie on the staff and nobody has to be fearful
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.220]   of openly sharing what they believe and can teach. Number three, is there a possible mismatch
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.160]   between your husband's philosophy of ministry and the philosophy of ministry in the leadership
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.280]   of the church? This is different from theology. It basically refers to how you go about ministry,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.840]   and in youth ministry this is explosively controversial. Parents often have views about
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.320]   what they think should happen in youth ministry that certainly should not happen in youth
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.880]   ministry, but if a youth minister doesn't have the full support of the senior pastor
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.240]   or the rest of the staff, he's not going to probably survive the onslaught of these
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.520]   parents who don't like what he's doing with their kids. Four, is there a possible
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:03.840]   mismatch of personality or culture? This can often feel like a matter of sin when in
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.360]   fact the essence of it is not necessarily sin, but genuine differences that are almost
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.880]   undefinable in the culture of ministry or the personality of the leadership in the youth
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:25.200]   minister, in the staff of the church. We need skillful, spiritually discerning friends inside
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:32.480]   or outside the church to help us discern whether our personalities are simply like oil and
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:39.280]   water on this staff. Maybe that was part of what was going on with Paul and Barnabas.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:48.520]   Number five, is this present discouragement a test of faithfulness and perseverance, or
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:57.560]   is it something that shouldn't be endured and needs to be changed? And God knows what
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.240]   you're in, and he's put you there, and his purpose is that you would persevere in grace
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.600]   and overcome evil with good. No matter what the outcome is, that's your calling. Discerning
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.280]   whether this is the case requires partners in ministry. And I suppose, this is number
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.600]   six, but a continuation of five, really, I suppose the most disheartening sentence in
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:31.640]   this wife's question was, "Our leadership remains fairly silent regarding the criticism
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:38.240]   and neither offers support nor guidance in how my husband can improve." That's just
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:47.800]   inexcusable. That's just inexcusable for a mature, godly staff to function that way.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:56.080]   And it's not at all uncommon, unfortunately, and suggests that the leadership is too immature
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:03.840]   or fearful, part of their own dysfunction, too fearful to deal face-to-face, up front,
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:14.880]   get the conflict, and take the flak that addressing it will get. And many, many leadership structures
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:22.520]   experience staff changes by simply not addressing staff problems. And that's the only way they
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.360]   know to deal with them. Well, if we don't do anything, the staff member that perhaps
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.520]   shouldn't be there in our judgment will just not be here if we let things get bad enough.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   Well, that's awful. That's just not the way Christians should do things. It just
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.920]   ticks me off when I see that happening. That's not the way we're told to deal with each
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:49.040]   other. It ought not to be. And I don't know if it is the case there or not, but that sentence
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.400]   was a big, red, flashing light to me, and I was so sad to read it.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:03.560]   But let me end with some encouragement. Clearly, God is sovereign, and God is over this present
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:10.120]   moment and has you in this situation of sorrow and pressure and burden and discouragement.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:16.520]   His purpose for you there is not your harm. It's not your harm. We know this because
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:24.640]   of Romans 8:28 and 8:32. We know that he has bought with his blood good for you in every
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:32.240]   circumstance. We know that his purpose is for you, and he wants your joy in the ministry.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.320]   We know that because of Hebrews 13:17, where it says, "Let the pastors do their work
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:44.740]   with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to the people." And we
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:51.800]   know that God's purpose is to bring you through this season stronger and happier.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.760]   So let me close with these two Psalms. Listen with your heart. Let it sink in. "Those
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:05.520]   who sow in tears," like in youth ministry, "shall reap with shouts of joy. He who
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:13.600]   goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.640]   his sheaves with him." That's Psalm 126, 5 and 6, and then this one from Psalm 30.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.720]   "Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning."
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.560]   Loads of leadership implications here. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.280]   A lot of the hardest questions come to us anonymously, and that's perfectly fine, to
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.120]   send them in with a request that they remain anonymous. We will, of course, respect that.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.440]   Thank you for your willingness to open up your life to the APJ community so that others
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.320]   in similar situations can be helped, or at least that's our prayer, that many of you
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.360]   would find help, as you find in this community, other people who are struggling with the same
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.480]   things you are. So please keep those questions coming in. Thank you for listening and making
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.760]   the podcast a part of your week. You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes

[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.320]   Well, Wednesday, we hear from a young woman who struggles with body image, and she wants
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.920]   to know what's wrong with immodesty in order to attract the attention of a future spouse.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.320]   We'll look at the heart of modesty and the heart of immodesty next time. I'm your host,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.880]   Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime pastor and
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   author, John Piper. We'll see you then.
