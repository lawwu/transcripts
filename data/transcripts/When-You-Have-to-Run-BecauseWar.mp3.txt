[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.540]   knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.560]   and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.420]   or less. My name is Josh Rasheeds and today I am here with Olena Livermore. Is
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.160]   that right? Yeah. How do you say it? Yeah, that's right.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.800]   Exactly right. Olena Livermore. Yeah, you were good at it. Perfect, perfect.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.140]   Olena and I were on a panel together, a panel discussion on how to choose where
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.940]   to live here at Nomad Capitalist Live. And Olena, I thought you just had such
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.960]   an interesting story that I wanted to just share it with my audience and talk
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.180]   briefly a little bit about your story. So you were born and raised in Ukraine, is
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440]   that right? Yes, that's right. I was born in Ukraine and basically I grew up there
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.640]   and went to university there in eastern part of Ukraine, Donetsk region. But yet
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.880]   you left Ukraine unexpectedly. What happened? Well, now I've been moving
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.960]   around but I had never planned that. I always wanted to settle down in Ukraine,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.640]   in Donetsk, but in 2014 this conflict started, like the war started and I had
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.080]   no choice but to leave. Okay, so 2014 there was a war. Who was the war with?
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.880]   Well, at first it was like really vague and no one could understand what's
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.760]   going on because, you know, in Ukraine they passed this law about the language
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.120]   because in eastern part of Ukraine people speak Russian mostly. And well, I
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.440]   say that most people speak Russian in Ukraine and west of Ukraine they speak
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.640]   Ukrainian and then they pass the language that you have to speak Ukrainian.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.720]   But in eastern part of Ukraine lots of people were really angry about that and
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.800]   we're so used in speaking Russian and using Russian everywhere at universities,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.240]   schools and stuff like that and people were already a bit angry and then they
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.520]   decided to organize this referendum and how they explained it, it's like, okay
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.320]   let's just become like an independent state, right? Like part of Ukraine but
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.280]   just with our own language and maybe our own rules, that's what people were told.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.520]   But in referendum actually the question was like if you want to be independent
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.680]   and some people, like a lot of people participated in that referendum because
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.360]   they were angry about the language and things like that and then basically like
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.840]   in a couple of days all of this news about separatism and a lot of tanks came
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.480]   in like to our region and they started like shooting at the airport. So they
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.840]   started from the airport area, like they started destroying infrastructure and
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.000]   things like that and I can't tell for sure like what really happened. Lots of
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.520]   people say that Russian troops were involved, like they showed in the news.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.880]   Like personally at that point I was there and I was leaving to another
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.040]   country, yeah, on holiday because I didn't know that, like I didn't expect it
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.240]   would start and I left but when I was leaving there were already a lot of
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.960]   military and like tanks there and they stopped me and checked my passport and
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.480]   things like that and while I was on holiday it was getting worse and worse
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.840]   and my parents called me and they said like you can't come back home, you just
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.920]   go somewhere and wait. But I didn't know where to wait because at that point I
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.480]   was like just a young graduate. I had a job but my employer didn't pay me money
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.760]   because of the war and I ran out of money and then my parents kind of sorted
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.160]   out, they called my friends' parents and they found out that there is like my
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.920]   friend's aunt who can like host me for a while and she was in St. Petersburg and
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   we came from Spain from our holiday to St. Petersburg just to wait and we had
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.600]   no money after holiday, my employer didn't pay me money and we just were
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.480]   kind of stuck in St. Petersburg and we were like okay we'll wait for a month,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.080]   just go back to Donetsk and continue our job. We were like English teachers and
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.760]   yeah just time, time just was going by and it was quite stressful like when
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.440]   people ask me if I like St. Petersburg, I like it as a city but it was a
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.480]   stressful period of my life and I remember I was calling my
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.920]   parents but the internet was like sometimes down, sometimes they answered
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.720]   their phone and like they just disappeared like or they started
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.440]   shooting again and yeah it was the most stressful time in my life and then we
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.480]   decided like to stay in Russia for a bit and start looking for a job because
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.360]   there is no way we could come back and started our life from scratch basically
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   with my family. Did your parents stay in Ukraine where the war was happening but you were
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.000]   in St. Petersburg or did they also flee to St. Petersburg with you? Right, my
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.920]   parents stayed there, yeah they were there and my grandparents but they
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.960]   already were planning kind of to leave somewhere else. My grandparents just
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.800]   didn't want to leave, it's hard for them to move and they're kind of no we're
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.880]   gonna just stay and die there whatever happens but you can't help those who
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   don't want to help you know. I tried to convince my grandparents but they didn't
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.360]   want to leave but my parents did move eventually to another region in Ukraine
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.960]   because their company moved where they worked and yeah they stayed there but
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.600]   they had to rent apartments again, start all over again, they lost all their jobs
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.480]   because my mom for example she worked on a train but everything was shut, airport
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.760]   destroyed, like train infrastructure was all shut down like you don't have any
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.160]   connection like with the rest of Ukraine even with Russia and yeah she lost her
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.240]   job, my dad lost his job and they had to move and start everything all over and I
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.840]   was helping them for a while and right now we bought a house in another region
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.520]   and my parents are living in that house. Wow, so you decided to stay in Russia, you
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.960]   had graduated from school but here you were no money, a new place, can't go home
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.800]   because of the war, how did you stay in Russia? Are you a Russian citizen? No I'm
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.840]   not a Russian citizen, well because I have a Ukrainian passport I can stay in
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.760]   Russia for three months but when the war started they let us extend that stay
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.840]   because we were refugees so I had like every three months I had to go to the
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.600]   immigration office and to extend my stay but it's like it's always like you never
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.640]   know what's gonna happen because sometimes they extend it, sometimes they
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.880]   can say just go back everything is fine there and it's like unstable you're kind
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   of trying to build your new life like you have a job you already have like
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.560]   friends and maybe some some connections and you extend it every time and you
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.920]   don't know okay maybe one day they'll say okay you cannot be a refugee anymore
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.680]   you have to go back because they stopped shooting and it was like you know
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   unstable and I was looking for other options and that's when I decided to go
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.800]   to another country to start looking for a job in another country. Of course, of course.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.240]   Okay so what I'm really interested about is this is a modern-day story right so
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.080]   much and what I talk about sometimes you feel like you're just talking about
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.880]   things 75 years ago and yet this is this is less than this is seven years ago.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.280]   Yeah exactly and it's going on now just from time to time. Is there still sporadic violence?
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.160]   Yeah you can hear shooting on the border and people are so used to it it's like at
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.520]   first we were all nervous yeah like we cried all the time when I called my
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.400]   parents, grandparents but now you know it became like oh hey how are you going?
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.360]   No it's fine they started shooting again we heard it today. It's like you know
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.760]   like they call it like shock shock vaccine or something like when people see
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   like all and hear all of this they just got like they're getting used to it and
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.920]   it's just like part of their life and they're like yeah that's fine and I kind
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.400]   of got used to it as well like from now and then you can hear and maybe see in
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.120]   the news Ukraine again and the Netsk region and Russian troops are there now
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.200]   at the border so people a bit worried now that it will start in summer and
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.880]   today when we were listening to Sergei Shvili he mentioned that it might
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.920]   start at summer all over again I hope it won't be that extreme like it was in
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.640]   2014 but yeah I can say that it's still in the conflict zone and I still can't
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.200]   go home as I used to because I have to go through a lot of military checkpoints
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.160]   and I have to apply for special pass to get home. Wow so you were Ukrainian a
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.960]   young fresh out of college graduate Ukrainian citizen living as a refugee in
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.840]   Russia no money your parents are not able to help very much what did you do
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:15.320]   then? Well yeah in Russia well at first you know I'm gonna say the good thing
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.840]   about Slavic countries is that when you're a friend you're like part of a
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   family yeah like Russians and Slavics they might be a bit cold and rude it's
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.120]   like seem to be rude it's part of our culture but when you become a friend
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.440]   you're literally a part of a family and I lived in my friend's aunt's house for
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.720]   several months like she fed me she gave me lunch boxes she even gave me money
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.960]   like for a bus when I started working when I got my first salary me and my
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.920]   friend we decided like to rent an apartment together and share like the
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.880]   cost of rent and then I found another job so like I worked from Monday to
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.160]   Friday at one company like was teaching in the language center and at the
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.760]   weekend in the other and helping parents a bit so yeah it was pretty stressful
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.600]   time but just because of help of these people who are not even related to me
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.800]   and when I tell the story like to my husband who is from New Zealand he is
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.320]   like amazed like how people just can help like that and I'm really grateful
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.720]   yeah for this part and I'm grateful that yeah there are some people who helped
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.360]   I'm pretty sure it's not only about Russia or Ukraine even if two countries
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.920]   are in a conflict people are still you can always find this kind people who can
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.720]   help but you were able to get a job teaching English because of your
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.760]   excellent English skills yeah right well my education is an English teacher so
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.640]   yeah I have masters in linguistics great well yeah I thought it would be
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.220]   challenging right I don't know because like in many language centers like in
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.080]   st. Petersburg they prefer native speakers and they usually employ native
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.720]   speakers and especially big cities like St. Petersburg and Moscow everyone wants
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.400]   to go there it's like an experience but yeah I easily found one but the problem
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.320]   was with my work permit like I was trying to apply for one and it took so
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.680]   long eventually I even didn't get it in Russia yeah okay yeah because if you're
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   like a foreigner like a proper foreigner from another country because like
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.280]   Ukrainians are not really like considered their foreigners here you're
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.120]   a foreigner but you speak Russian and you have the same culture and things
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.840]   like that so for foreigners they take care of your documents but for Ukrainians
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.200]   there were so many refugees at that point and they were like processing it
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.400]   so long I yeah I didn't get it we left and we found a job in another country
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.160]   where did you go well I met my husband in St. Petersburg Blake and he was New
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.640]   Zealand yeah he's a New Zealander but he was living in St. Petersburg he was an
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.800]   English teacher as well yeah we met at the same school like we worked in the
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.920]   same company we were teaching adults in St. Petersburg and then we decided to
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.400]   apply for a new job and we got a job in East Timor well it was a funny story
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.000]   because I was looking for a well-paid job because I wanted to help my parents
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.840]   and get like stable with finance and everything and East Timor was like
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.560]   really highly paid and we couldn't understand why but when we arrived we
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.560]   understood because that country was just after the war there were a lot of
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.840]   peacekeepers and we were working for a company helping out people learn English
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.400]   like we were teaching the government basically like university professors
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.040]   and ministries like so they get stable with their language skills and they can
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.880]   like build their relationship with other countries but yeah that experience was
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.560]   the most interesting one because it was like coming from a big city to a small
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.120]   island with no infrastructure I had to learn like how to drive a motorbike and
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.680]   things like that but I'm really grateful that I grew a lot as a person like a lot
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.400]   I learned a lot from this experience and how long were you there in East Timor
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:43.880]   we were about a year like we were yeah we were there for a year and money was
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.200]   great like you fulfilled your contract yes yeah yeah we signed the contract we
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.280]   were we were considering to stay longer to save money but it was getting more
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.840]   dangerous because it was this conflict between Australians and East Timorese
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.280]   because well if you follow up the news I guess like at that point if I remember
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:10.000]   it was 2016 and they were unhappy that Australians take their oil and there
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.720]   were some local people like tribes they didn't like it and they started taking
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.240]   foreigners and we decided like yeah it's quite dangerous so we left to Kuala
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.920]   Lumpur Malaysia so then from East Timor you and your husband both moved to
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.880]   Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and you worked there as English teachers again yeah we
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.560]   were growing with that yeah then we started being like what it's called like
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.200]   director of studies managing schools training other teachers yeah so
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.720]   basically building career in this area and after that we moved to China and
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.560]   then after that to China yeah and where are you living now well it's a funny
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.800]   story after China we went back to Malaysia again yeah but because of the
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   pandemic like coronavirus situation our company we're working for I've got
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.840]   shut down and they cancelled our work visas in Malaysia and we had to go back
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.720]   to one country where both of us could go back so we had two options Ukraine or
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.120]   New Zealand and I started collecting documents for New Zealand but I was
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.520]   missing one paper which is police check from China and China doesn't issue police
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.560]   check outside the country and I couldn't go back because of coronavirus so the
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.320]   only option was Ukraine so we got back now my husband is applying for a
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.280]   permanent residency and we started our own online company and we're teaching
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.120]   business English to other companies who need English great great so the reason I
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.680]   invited you on to radical personal finance was that this is a very current
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.000]   story I teach a class called how to survive and thrive during the coming
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.520]   economic crisis and you faced an economic crisis caused by a military
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.640]   crisis and you know it can happen in many places faster than you would
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   imagine you go on holiday and all of a sudden you can't come back from holiday
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.600]   so we're here of course at Nomad Capitalist live talking about
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.280]   international strategies citizenship residency etc and you've lived through a
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   very disconcerting period so you're doing fine you and your husband are
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   settling in Ukraine in Ukraine because that's where where you have
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.760]   residency rights looking back if you could go back and do some points of
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.320]   preparation that would have made things easier for you what would you have done
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.440]   knowing what you know now if you could talk to a 20 year old and imagine money
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.320]   is no object obviously it is but money is no object times no object what what
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.120]   advice would you give to someone to prepare for such a thing to get through
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.120]   it faster if you have time to yeah assume somebody's living in a peaceful
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.480]   place but they would they would want to have a plan in case all of a sudden they
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.320]   had to flee what would you do well I think everyone should already get ready
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.080]   for this kind of case and always have a backup plan that situation taught me on
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.920]   that you need to have a backup plan and I mean by that like a second citizenship
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.960]   or a house somewhere else or some something where you can fly to and you
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.880]   can easily stay there and I can't like if you ask me about countries where
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.920]   would I go instead like instead of Russia or somewhere else yeah there are
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.000]   many options like I would maybe plan to go to Mexico like right now we're in
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.440]   Mexico and I really like it and it's really easy for Ukrainian citizens just
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.360]   to come here and you can stay here three months without any problem you can go to
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.920]   Argentina any way you want but again just right now at this point of my life
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.320]   I realized I want to have several passports I want to have property which
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.520]   I can call home at least in several countries so in case this happens I can
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.680]   take all my family and go there and yeah I guess that's that's advice don't wait
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.360]   until it happens just think about it right now because I didn't expect it at
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.800]   all like it's Europe it's 21st century and like you see the tank like in the
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.720]   street and people can like hear like missiles and like the house opposite
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.360]   mine got destroyed and it's just like it's unbelievable so yeah don't wait
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.080]   until it happens and what I would point out just what I observe is you've been
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.280]   able to survive and even thrive during this time because of your educational
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.880]   background you have strong academic credentials a master's degree in
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   linguistics you have strong language skills your English is world-class and
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.080]   that's allowed you employment security and even though you started with nothing
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.560]   you and your husband have been able to earn money I'm sure save enough that you
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.680]   can go from position to position and that allows you to stabilize yourself
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.360]   and so you did a lot of things really well that allowed you to get through
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.320]   this time probably better than some of your friends because of that proper
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.480]   planning and then yes it would be easier if you had multiple residencies a house
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.560]   another place and multiple citizenships I've got also add like networking you
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.520]   know like when when you've got a chance to go to other countries to go to
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.880]   conferences like that always like make connection get to know people so in this
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.680]   kind of cases like there will be someone to help like even if you have no options
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.160]   at all no one can your family can't help you people are nice like if you have
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.480]   friends if you have someone like just yeah I keep in touch yeah well you know
