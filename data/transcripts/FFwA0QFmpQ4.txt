[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.680]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.880]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.680]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.680]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.200]   It is, however, part of my desire
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.480]   to bring you zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.820]   about science and science-related tools.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.760]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.320]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.080]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.880]   that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.000]   Helix mattresses are amazing.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.120]   I can say this because I've been sleeping on one,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.740]   and I've been sleeping better than I've ever slept before.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.360]   The interesting thing about Helix mattresses
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.480]   is that they're tailored to your unique body type
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.240]   and sleeping style.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.240]   What's a sleeping style?
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.480]   Well, if you go to the Helix site,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.740]   you can take a quick quiz.
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.400]   It takes about two minutes
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.480]   as to whether or not you sleep on your stomach,
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.720]   your side, your back,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.940]   whether or not you flip back and forth,
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.020]   or whether or not you don't know
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.420]   in what position you sleep,
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.560]   as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or run cold,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.440]   wake up cold, wake up hot, et cetera.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.520]   If you do that, then it will match you to the mattress
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.840]   that's perfect for your sleep needs.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.480]   If you want to try a Helix mattress,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.520]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.820]   And if you do that, you'll get $200 off your order
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.240]   as well as two free pillows.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.860]   That's helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.460]   The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.180]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.120]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.920]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400]   and I started using it because I had a lot of confusion
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.720]   about what vitamins and minerals I should take.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.680]   And taking Athletic Greens allowed me to get the foundation
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.180]   or sort of the base of everything I need
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.240]   in one easy to consume formula.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.280]   It tastes great.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.160]   I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice,
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.640]   and I like drinking it.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.400]   And the probiotics in there are important to me as well,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.680]   because there are a lot of data out there now
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.800]   identifying the gut microbiome
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.240]   and the importance of the gut brain axis
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.920]   for immune function, metabolic function, and so forth.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.680]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.200]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.400]   And if you do that, they'll also send you a year's supply
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.520]   of liquid vitamin D3K2.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.240]   There are a lot of data starting to surface
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   about the importance of vitamin D3 for immune function,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.360]   metabolic function, endocrine function, and so forth.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.920]   In addition, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.820]   you'll get the year's supply of D3 and K2,
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.480]   as well as five free travel packs,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120]   which are little packets of Athletic Greens
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.840]   in addition to your normal order.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.760]   And those are great for when you're on the plane
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.220]   or you're otherwise traveling.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.720]   They mix up really easily without any mess
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.280]   or the need to spoon out powder and things of that sort.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.120]   So the things that are easy to do at home
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.240]   are kind of harder on the road.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.720]   Those packets make it easy while on the road.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.280]   Today, we're going to talk about dreaming,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   learning during dreaming, and unlearning during dreaming,
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.960]   in particular, unlearning of troubling emotional events.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.460]   Now, my interest in dreaming goes way back.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.240]   When I was a child, I had a friend
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.860]   and he came over one day and he brought with him a mask
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.160]   that had a little red light in the corner.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.040]   He had purchased this thing through some magazine ad
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.480]   that he had seen.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.240]   And this mask was supposed to trigger lucid dreaming.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.040]   Lucid dreaming is the experience of dreaming during sleep,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.120]   but being aware that one is dreaming.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.440]   And in some cases, being able to direct
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.600]   one's dream activities.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   So if you're in a lucid dream and you want to fly,
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.920]   for instance, some people report being able to initiate
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.360]   that experience of flying or to contort themselves
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.320]   into an animal or to transport themselves
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.580]   to wherever they want within the dream.
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.680]   I tried this device.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.640]   The way it worked is you put on the mask
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   during the waking state, wide awake,
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.800]   and you'd look at the little light flashing in the corner.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   And then you'd also wear it when you went to sleep at night.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.360]   And indeed, while I was asleep,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.400]   I could see the red light presumably through my eyelids,
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.000]   although for all I know, I had opened my eyes.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.400]   I don't know, I was asleep.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.240]   And then because I was dreaming
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.440]   and I was experiencing something very vivid,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.720]   I was able to recognize that I was dreaming
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.180]   and then start to direct some of the events
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.440]   within that dream.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.580]   Now, lucid dreaming occurs in about 20% of people.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.840]   And in a small percentage of those people,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.800]   they lucid dream almost every night.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.440]   So much so that many of them report their sleep
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.360]   not being as restorative as it would be otherwise.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.120]   Now, all of this is to say that lucid dreaming and dreaming
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.140]   are profound experiences.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.140]   We tend to feel extremely attached to our dream experience.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.000]   This may explain the phenomenon
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.900]   of people who have a very intense dream,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.080]   they need to somehow tell everybody about that dream
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.280]   or tell someone about that dream.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.740]   I don't really know what that behavior is about,
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.520]   but sometimes we wake up and we feel so attached
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.020]   to what happened in this state that we call dreaming,
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.440]   that there seems to be an intense need
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.520]   to share it with other people,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.280]   presumably to process it and make sense of it.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.780]   Now, numerous people throughout history
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.140]   have tried to make sense of dreams
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.560]   in some sort of organized way.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.920]   The most famous of which of course is Sigmund Freud,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.620]   who talked about symbolic representations in dreams.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.700]   A lot of that has been kind of debunked,
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.660]   although I think that there's some interest
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.100]   in what the symbols of dreaming are.
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.500]   And this is something that we'll talk about
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.560]   in more depth today,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.300]   although not Freudian theory in particular.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.060]   So I think in order to really think about dreams
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.220]   and what to do with them
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.960]   and how to maximize the dream experience
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.440]   for sake of learning and unlearning,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.940]   the best way to address this
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.880]   is to look at the physiology of sleep,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.760]   to really just what do we know concretely about sleep?
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.140]   So first of all, as we get sleepy,
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.060]   we tend to shut our eyes
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.160]   and that's 'cause there are some autonomic centers
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.520]   in the brain, some neurons that control closing
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.220]   of the eyelids when we get sleepy.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.060]   And then we transition into sleep.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.900]   And sleep, regardless of how long we sleep,
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.340]   is generally broken up into a series of 90 minute cycles,
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.780]   these ultradian cycles.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.140]   So early in the night,
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.780]   these 90 minute cycles tend to be comprised
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.720]   more of shallow sleep and slow wave sleep.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.420]   So stage one, stage two, et cetera,
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.880]   and what we call slow wave sleep.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.460]   I'll go into detail about what all this means in a moment.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.520]   And we tend to have less so-called REM sleep,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.780]   R-E-M sleep, which stands for rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.340]   And I'll talk about rapid eye movement sleep in detail.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.180]   So early in the night, a lot more slow wave sleep
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.940]   and less REM.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.760]   For every 90 minute cycle that we have
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.680]   during a night of sleep,
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.180]   we tend to start having more and more REM sleep.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.660]   So more of that 90 minute cycle is comprised of REM sleep
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.460]   and less of slow wave sleep.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.300]   Now, this is true regardless of whether or not
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.720]   you wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.220]   or your sleep is broken.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.780]   The more sleep you're getting across the night,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.900]   the more REM sleep you're going to have.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.700]   And REM sleep and non-REM, as I'll refer to it,
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.520]   have distinctly different roles in learning and unlearning,
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.800]   and they are responsible for learning and unlearning
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.300]   of distinctly different types of information.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.580]   And this has enormous implications
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.060]   for learning of motor skills,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.500]   for unlearning of traumatic events
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.660]   or for processing emotionally challenging
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.380]   as well as emotionally pleasing events.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.200]   And as we'll see, one can actually leverage
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.080]   their daytime activities
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.620]   in order to access more slow wave sleep
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.960]   or non-REM sleep as we'll call it,
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.400]   or more REM sleep depending on your particular emotional
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.660]   and physical needs.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.560]   So it's really a remarkable stage of life
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.240]   that we have a lot more control and power over
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.920]   than you might believe.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.520]   We'll also talk about lucid dreaming.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.760]   We're also going to talk about hallucinations
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.080]   and how drug induced hallucinations
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.480]   have a surprising similarity to a lot of dream states
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.100]   and yet some really important differences.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.140]   Okay, so let's start by talking about slow wave sleep
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.740]   or non-REM sleep.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.500]   Now I realize that slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.940]   aren't exactly the same thing.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.060]   So for you sleep aficionados out there,
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.220]   I am lumping right now, as we say in science,
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.300]   there are lumpers and there are splitters, and I am both.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.460]   Sometimes I lump, sometimes I split.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.800]   For sake of clarity and ease of conversation right now,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.860]   I'm going to be a lumper.
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.580]   So when I say slow wave sleep,
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.940]   I mean non-REM sleep generally,
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.700]   although I acknowledge there is a distinction.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.620]   Slow wave sleep.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.420]   So slow wave sleep is characterized
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.500]   by a particular pattern of brain activity
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.440]   in which the brain is metabolically active,
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.380]   but that there's these big sweeping waves of activity
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.800]   that include a lot of the brain.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.660]   If you want to look this up there,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.520]   you can find evidence for sweeping of waves
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.820]   of neural activity across association cortex,
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.660]   across big swaths of the brainstem,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.900]   the so-called pons geniculate occipital pathway.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.900]   This is brainstem thalamus, and then cortex
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.680]   for those of you that are interested,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.780]   although more of that is going to occur in REM sleep.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.180]   Now, the interesting thing about slow wave sleep
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.120]   are the neuromodulators that tend to be associated with it
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.060]   that are most active and least active
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.900]   during slow wave sleep, and here's why.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.380]   To remind you, neuromodulators are these chemicals
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.660]   that act rather slowly, but their main role
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.900]   is to bias particular brain circuits to be active
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.020]   and other brain circuits to not be active.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.860]   These are like the music playlist.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.100]   So think of neuromodulators,
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.140]   and these come in the names of acetylcholine,
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.300]   norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.980]   Think of them as suggesting playlists on your audio device.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.580]   So classical music is distinctly different
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.060]   in feel and tone and a number of other features
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.060]   from like third wave punk or from hip hop, right?
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.220]   So think of them as biasing toward particular genres
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.580]   of neural circuit activity, okay?
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.020]   Mellow music versus really aggressive fast music
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.820]   or rhythmic music that includes lyrics
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.260]   versus rhythmic music that doesn't include lyrics.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.980]   That's more or less the way to think
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.180]   about these neuromodulators, and they are associated
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.480]   as a consequence with certain brain functions.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.620]   So we know for instance, and just to review,
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.160]   acetylcholine in waking states is a neuromodulator
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.680]   that tends to amplify the activity of brain circuits
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.300]   associated with focus and attention.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.020]   Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.780]   that tends to amplify the brain circuits
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.580]   associated with alertness and the desire to move.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.760]   Serotonin is the neuromodulator that's released
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.660]   and tends to amplify the circuits in the brain and body
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.380]   that are associated with bliss
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.580]   and the desire to remain still.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.120]   And dopamine is the neuromodulator that's released
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.620]   and that's associated with amplification
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.260]   of the neural circuits in the brain and body
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.940]   associated with pursuing goals and pleasure and reward, okay?
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.940]   So in slow wave sleep, something really interesting happens.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.740]   There's essentially no acetylcholine.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.760]   Acetylcholine production and release and action
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.400]   from the two major sites, which are in the brainstem,
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.500]   which from a nucleus, it's a parabigeminal nucleus,
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.940]   if you really want to know,
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.500]   or from the forebrain, which is nucleus basalis,
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.720]   and you don't need to know these names,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.340]   but if you like, that's why I put them out there.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.840]   Acetylcholine production plummets.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.900]   It's just almost to zero.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.900]   And acetylcholine, as I just mentioned,
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.820]   is associated with focus.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.440]   So you can think of slow wave sleep
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.160]   as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.640]   and a kind of distortion of space and time
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.720]   so that we're not really focusing on any one thing.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.440]   Now, the other molecules that are very active at that time
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.140]   are norepinephrine, which is a little bit surprising
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.980]   'cause normally in waking states,
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.800]   norepinephrine is going to be associated
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.880]   with a lot of alertness and the desire to move.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.800]   But there's not a ton of norepinephrine around
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.400]   in slow wave sleep, but it is around.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.840]   So there's something associated
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.280]   with the movement circuitry going on in slow wave sleep.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.360]   And remember, this is happening
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.960]   mostly at the beginning of the night.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.440]   Your sleep is dominated by slow wave sleep.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.920]   So no acetylcholine, very little norepinephrine,
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.680]   although there is some, and a lot of serotonin.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.880]   And serotonin, again, is associated with this desire,
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.340]   the sensation of kind of bliss or wellbeing,
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.400]   but not a lot of movement.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.120]   And during sleep, you tend not to move.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.060]   Now, in slow wave sleep, you can move.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.600]   You're not paralyzed, so you can roll over.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.520]   If people are going to sleepwalk,
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.300]   typically it's going to be during slow wave sleep.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.220]   And what studies have shown
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.380]   through some kind of sadistic experiments
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.780]   where people are deprived specifically of slow wave sleep,
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.140]   and that can be done by waking them up
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.180]   as soon as the electrode recordings show
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.720]   that they're in slow wave sleep,
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.360]   or by chemically altering their sleep
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.080]   so that it biases them away from slow wave sleep.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.600]   What studies have shown is that motor learning
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.080]   is generally occurring in slow wave sleep.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.680]   So let's say the day before you go to sleep,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.620]   you were learning some new dance move,
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.300]   or you were learning some specific motor skill,
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.340]   either a fine motor skill or a course motor skill.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.360]   So let's say it's a new form of exercise
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.640]   or some new coordinated movements.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.360]   This could be coordinated movement
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.540]   at the level of the fingers,
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.380]   or it could be coordinated movement
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.520]   at the level of the whole body and large limb movements.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.580]   It could involve other people,
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.340]   or it could be a solo activity.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.180]   Learning of those skills
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.740]   is happening primarily during slow wave sleep
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.600]   in the early part of the night.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.060]   In addition, slow wave sleep has been shown to be important
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.200]   for the learning of detailed information.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.360]   Now, this isn't always cognitive information.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.880]   We're going to talk about cognitive information,
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.560]   but the studies that have been done along these lines
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.840]   involve having people learn very detailed information
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.360]   about very specific rules
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.680]   and the way that certain words are spelled.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.360]   They tend to be challenging words.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.360]   So if people are tested in terms of their performance
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.240]   on these types of exams
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.440]   and they're deprived of slow wave sleep,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.560]   they tend to perform very poorly.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.420]   So we can think of slow wave sleep
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.880]   as important for motor learning, motor skill learning,
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.380]   and for the learning of specific details
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.400]   about specific events.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.200]   And this turns out to be fundamentally important
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.000]   because now we know that slow wave sleep
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.040]   is primarily in the early part of the night
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.400]   and motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.720]   and detail learning is occurring early in the night.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.440]   Now, for those of you that are waking up
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.240]   after only three, four hours of sleep,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.680]   this might be informative.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.560]   This might tell you a little something
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.320]   about what you are able to learn and not able to learn
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.660]   if that were to be the only sleep that you get,
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.460]   although hopefully that's not the only sleep that you get.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.780]   But we're going to dive deep into how it is
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.440]   that one can maximize motor learning
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.520]   in order to extract, say, more detail information
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.780]   about coordinated movements
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.820]   and how to make them faster or slower.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.760]   So that might be important for certain sports.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.820]   It might be almost certainly important for certain sports.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.400]   It's going to be important for any kind
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.160]   of coordinated movement, like say learning to play the piano,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.160]   or for instance, how to learn synchronized movements
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.580]   with somebody else.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.420]   So maybe I mentioned the example of dance earlier.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.760]   If you, like me, a few years ago,
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.620]   I set out to learn tango
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.300]   because I have some Argentine relatives and I was abysmal.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   I need to return to that at some point.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.700]   I was just abysmal.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.840]   And one of the worst things
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.260]   about being abysmal at learning dance
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.100]   is that there's somebody else
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.140]   has to suffer the consequences also.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.920]   So I don't know, maybe in a month on neuroplasticity,
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.180]   I'll explore that again as a self-experimentation.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.260]   But the key things to know are slow-wave sleeps involved
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.820]   in motor learning and detailed learning.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.340]   There's no acetylcholine around at that time,
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.500]   has this big amplitude activity
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.060]   sweeping throughout the brain.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.620]   And that there's the release of these neuromodulators,
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.040]   norepinephrine and serotonin.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.740]   And again, that's all happening early in the night.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.640]   So athletes, people that are concerned about performance,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.800]   if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.100]   of three, four hours of sleep
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.120]   because you're excited about a competition the next day,
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.000]   presumably if you've already trained the skills
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.460]   that you need for the event,
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.380]   you should be fine to engage in that particular activity.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.260]   Now, it's always going to be better
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.180]   to get a full night's sleep.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.880]   And a full night's sleep for you is six hours,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.060]   then it's always going to be better
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.780]   to get more sleep than it is to get less.
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.960]   However, I think some people get a little bit
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.560]   overly concerned that if they didn't get
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.220]   their full night's sleep before some sort of physical event,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.840]   that their performance is going to plummet.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.140]   Presumably if you've already learned what you need to do
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.700]   and it's stored in your neural circuits
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.740]   and you know how to make those coordinated movements,
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.680]   what the literature on slow wave sleep suggests
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.280]   is that you would be replenished,
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.780]   that the motor learning and the recovery from exercise
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.340]   is going to happen early in the night.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.000]   So we'll just pause there and kind of shelve that
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.900]   for a moment and then we're going to come back to it.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.620]   But I want to talk about REM sleep
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.740]   or rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.520]   REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.960]   as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night,
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.460]   but you're going to have more of it.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.000]   A larger percentage of these 90 minute sleep cycles
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.020]   is going to be comprised of REM sleep
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.600]   as you get toward morning.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.160]   REM sleep is fascinating.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.680]   It was discovered in the '50s
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.000]   when a sleep laboratory in Chicago,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.260]   the researchers observed that people's eyes
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.840]   were moving under their eyelids.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.100]   Now, something very important that we're going to address
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.480]   when we talk about trauma later
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.360]   is that the eye movements are not just side to side,
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.040]   they're very erratic in all different directions.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.760]   One thing that I don't think anyone,
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.940]   I've never heard anyone really talk about publicly
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.120]   is why eye movements during sleep, right?
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.040]   Eyes are closed and sometimes people's eyelids
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.940]   will be a little bit open and their eyes are darting around,
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.200]   especially in little kids.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.460]   I don't suggest you do this.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.560]   I'm not even sure it's ethical,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.160]   but it has been done where you pull back the eyelids
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.120]   of a kid while they're sleeping
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.200]   and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.960]   I think people do this to their passed out friends
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.280]   at parties and things like that.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.400]   So again, I don't suggest you do it,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.960]   but I'm telling you it because it's been done before
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.480]   and therefore you don't have to do it again.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.600]   But rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.200]   and occurs because there are connections
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.240]   between the brainstem, an area called the pons,
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.880]   and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brainstem
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.420]   that are involved in generating movements
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.520]   in different directions, sometimes called saccades.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.360]   Although sometimes during rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.880]   it's not just rapid, it's kind of a jittery side to side
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.520]   thing and then the eyeballs kind of roll.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.080]   It's really pretty creepy to look at if you see.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.600]   So what's happening there is the circuitry
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.400]   that is involved in conscious eye movements
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.540]   is kind of going haywire, but it's not haywire.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.180]   It's these waves of activity from the brainstem
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.680]   up to the so-called thalamus,
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.560]   which is an area that filters sensory information
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.520]   and then up to the cortex.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.840]   And the cortex, of course,
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.440]   is involved in conscious perceptions.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.500]   So in rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.740]   there are a couple of things that are happening
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.320]   besides rapid eye movements.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.440]   The main ones are that they're, I should say,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.180]   in contrast to slow wave sleep.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.180]   In REM sleep, serotonin is essentially absent, okay?
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.900]   So this molecule, this neuromodulator
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.920]   that tends to create the feeling of bliss and wellbeing
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.840]   and just calm, placidity is absent, all right?
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.320]   So that's interesting.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.920]   In addition to that, norepinephrine,
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.660]   this molecule that's involved in movement and alertness
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.320]   is absolutely absent.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.020]   It's probably one of the few times in our life
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.820]   that epinephrine is essentially at zero activity
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.000]   within our system.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.020]   And that has a number of very important implications
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.640]   for the sorts of dreaming that occur during REM sleep
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.160]   and the sorts of learning that can occur
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.500]   in REM sleep and unlearning.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.440]   First of all, in REM sleep, we are paralyzed.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.360]   We are experiencing what's called atonia,
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.760]   which just means that we're completely laid out
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.040]   and paralyzed.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.920]   We also tend to experience whatever it is
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.540]   that we're dreaming about as a kind of hallucination
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.640]   or a hallucinatory activity.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.480]   Long ago, I looked into hallucinations and dreaming.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.760]   I was just fascinated by this in high school.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.840]   And there's some great books on this if you're interested
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.120]   in exploring the relationship between hallucinations
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.700]   and dreaming, the most famous of which are from a guy,
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.400]   researcher at Harvard, Alan Hobson.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.480]   I wrote a book called "Dream Drugstore"
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.680]   and talked all about the similarities between drugs
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.500]   that induce hallucinations and dreaming in REM.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.440]   So you can explore that if you like.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.460]   So in REM, our eyes are moving,
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.560]   but the rest of our body is paralyzed
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.280]   and we are hallucinating.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.000]   There's no epinephrine around.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.040]   Epinephrine doesn't just create a desire
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.700]   to move and alertness.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.700]   It is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.780]   It's what's released from our adrenal glands
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.560]   when we experience something that's fearful or alerting.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.620]   So if a car suddenly screeches in front of us
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.840]   or we get a troubling text message,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.600]   adrenaline is deployed into our system.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.120]   Adrenaline is epinephrine.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.440]   Those are equivalent molecules.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.200]   And epinephrine isn't just released from our adrenals.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.320]   It's also released within our brain.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.560]   So there's this weird stage of our life
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.000]   that happens more toward morning that we call REM sleep
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.340]   where we're hallucinating
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.840]   and having these outrageous experiences in our mind,
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.160]   but the chemical that's associated with fear and panic
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.560]   and anxiety is not available to us.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.880]   And that turns out to be very important.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.040]   And you can imagine why that's important.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.640]   It's important because it allows us to experience things,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.440]   both replay of things that did occur
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.240]   as well as elaborate contortions of things
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.080]   that didn't occur.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.160]   And it allows us to experience those
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.520]   in the absence of fear and anxiety.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.760]   And that it turns out is very important
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.460]   for adjusting our emotional relationship
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.980]   to challenging things that happened to us
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.800]   while we were awake.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.600]   Those challenging things can sometimes be in the form
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.480]   of social anxiety or just having been working very hard
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.960]   or concern about an upcoming event.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.480]   Or sometimes people report, for instance,
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.560]   dreams where they find themselves late to an exam
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   or naked in public or in some sort of situation
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.240]   that would be very troubling to them.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.900]   And that almost certainly occurs during REM sleep.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.920]   So we have this incredible period of sleep
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.400]   in which our experience of emotionally laden events
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.640]   is dissociated, it's chemically blocked
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.940]   from us having the actual emotion.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.380]   Now, probably immediately some of you are thinking,
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.320]   well, what about nightmares?
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.500]   I have nightmares and those carry a lot of emotion
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.460]   or sometimes I'll wake up in a panic.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.520]   Let's consider each of those two things separately
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.300]   because they are important in understanding REM sleep.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.820]   There's a good chance that nightmares are occurring
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.880]   during slow wave sleep.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.720]   There are actually some drugs
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.080]   that I don't suggest people take,
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.240]   in fact, so much so I'm not going to mention them,
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   that give people very kind of scary or eerie dreams
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.060]   and this kind of feeling that things are pursuing them
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.480]   or that they can't move when they are being chased.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.060]   That's actually a common dream that I've had
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.180]   as I guess it's more or less a nightmare,
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.720]   the feeling that one is paralyzed and can't move
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.560]   and is being chased.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.660]   A lot of people have said,
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.580]   oh, that must be in REM sleep because you're paralyzed
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.280]   and so you're dreaming about being paralyzed
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.580]   and you can't move.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.060]   I think that's probably false.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.800]   The research says that because norepinephrine
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.320]   is absent during REM sleep,
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.600]   it's very unlikely that you can have
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.740]   these intense fearful memories.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.240]   So those are probably occurring in slow wave sleep.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.520]   Although there might be instances
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.260]   where people have nightmares in REM sleep.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.440]   The other thing is some people experience,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.240]   certainly I've had this experience of waking up
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.620]   and feeling very stressed about whatever it was
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.940]   that I happened to be thinking about
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.660]   or dreaming about in the moments before.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.060]   And that's an interesting case of an invasion
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.740]   of the dream state into the waking state.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.300]   And the moment you wake up, epinephrine is available.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.640]   So the research on this isn't fully crystallized,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.020]   but most of it points in the direction
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.220]   of the experience of waking up and feeling very panicked,
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.560]   maybe, I wanna highlight may,
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.700]   but maybe that you were experiencing something
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.580]   that was troubling in the daytime,
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.160]   you're repeating that experience in your sleep.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.680]   Epinephrine is not available
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.160]   and therefore the brain circuits associated
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.160]   with fear and anxiety are shut off
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.860]   and so you're able to process those events.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.360]   And then suddenly you wake up
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.240]   and there's a surge of adrenaline of epinephrine
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.360]   that's now coupled to that experience.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.040]   So nightmares very likely in slow wave sleep
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.700]   and that kind of panic on waking from something
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.360]   very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts and ideas,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.920]   however distorted in REM sleep invading the waking state.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.260]   In fact, that brings to mind something
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.440]   that I've mentioned once before,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.720]   but I wanna mention again, this atonia,
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.360]   this paralysis that we experienced during sleep
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.320]   can invade the waking state.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.880]   Many people report the experience of waking up
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.480]   and being paralyzed.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.880]   They're legitimately waking up, it's not a dream.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.720]   Waking up and being paralyzed and it is terrifying.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.040]   I've had this happen before.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.520]   It is, I can tell you, terrifying to be wide awake
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.500]   and as far as I could tell, fully conscious,
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.040]   but unable to move.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.620]   And then generally you can jolt yourself out of it
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.640]   in a few seconds, but it is quite frightening.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.820]   Now, some people actually experience waking up,
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.320]   being fully paralyzed and hallucinating.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.680]   And there is a theory in the academic
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.420]   and scientific community at least,
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.460]   that what people report as alien abductions
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.400]   have a certain number of core characteristics
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.640]   that map quite closely, eerily similarly
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.920]   to these experiences.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.760]   A lot of reports of alien induction
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.040]   involve people being unable to move,
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.360]   seeing particular faces, hallucinating extensively,
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.840]   feeling like their body is floating
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.000]   or they were transported.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.960]   This is very similar to the experience
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.520]   of invasion of atonia into the waking state,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.440]   waking up and still being paralyzed,
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.420]   as well as the hallucinations that are characteristic
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.140]   of dreaming in REM sleep.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.900]   Now, I'm not saying that people's alien abductions
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.120]   were not legitimate alien abductions, how could I?
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.840]   I wasn't there and if I was there, I wouldn't tell you
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.460]   'cause that would make me an alien
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.180]   and I wouldn't want you to know.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.880]   But it is quite possible that people are experiencing
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.980]   these things and they are an invasion of the sleep state
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.800]   into the waking state and they can last several minutes
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.980]   or longer and because in dreams,
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.640]   space and time are distorted,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.520]   our perception of these events could be
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.340]   that they lasted many hours and we can really feel
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.840]   as if they lasted many hours when in fact,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.160]   they took only moments.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.260]   And we're going to return to distortion of space and time
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.480]   in a little bit.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.680]   So to just recap where we've gone so far,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.920]   slow wave sleep early in the night,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.720]   it's been shown to be important for motor learning
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.640]   and for detail learning.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.480]   REM sleep has a certain dream component
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.520]   when which there's no epinephrine,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.800]   therefore we can't experience anxiety, we are paralyzed.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.280]   Those dreams tend to be really vivid
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.520]   and have a lot of detail to them.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.640]   And yet in REM sleep, what's very clear is that the sorts
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.720]   of learning that happen in REM sleep are not motor events,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.120]   it's more about unlearning of emotional events.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.480]   And now we know why, because the chemicals available
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   for really feeling those emotions are not present.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.880]   Now that has very important implications.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.560]   So let's address those implications from two sides.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.320]   First of all, we should ask what happens
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.380]   if we don't get enough REM sleep?
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.640]   And a scenario that happens a lot
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.680]   where people don't get enough REM sleep is the following.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.020]   I'll just explain the one that I'm familiar with
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.640]   'cause it happens to me a lot,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.940]   although I figured out ways to adjust.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.880]   I go to sleep around 10, 30, 11 o'clock,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.560]   I fall asleep very easily,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.480]   and then I wake up around three or 4 a.m.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.960]   I now know to use a NSDR, a non-sleep deep rest protocol,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.000]   and that allows me to fall back asleep.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.680]   Even though it's called non-sleep deep rest,
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.400]   it really allows me to relax my body and brain
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.700]   and I tend to fall back asleep and sleep till about 7 a.m.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.320]   during which time I get a lot of REM sleep.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.400]   And I know this because I've measured it
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.240]   and I know this because my dreams tend to be very intense
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.520]   of the sort that we know is typical of REM sleep.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.700]   In this scenario,
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.580]   I've gotten my slow wave sleep early in the night
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.640]   and I've got my REM sleep toward morning.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.040]   However, there are times when I don't go back to sleep.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.000]   Maybe I have a flight to catch, that's happened.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.340]   Sometimes I've got a lot on my mind
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.800]   and I don't go back to sleep.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.920]   I can tell you, and you've probably experienced it,
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.860]   that the lack of REM sleep tends to make people
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.500]   emotionally irritable.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.480]   It tends to make us feel as if the little things
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.820]   are the big things.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.920]   So it's very clear from laboratory studies
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.560]   where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.960]   that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.040]   and we tend to catastrophize small things.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.800]   We tend to feel like the world is really daunting.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.300]   We're never going to move forward in the ways that we want.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.560]   We can't unlearn the emotional components
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.520]   of whatever it is that's been happening,
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.780]   even if it's not traumatic.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.540]   The other thing that happens in REM sleep
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.260]   is a replay of certain types of spatial information
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.220]   about where we were and why we were in those places.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.180]   And this maps to some beautiful data and studies
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.780]   that were initiated by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.980]   years ago showing that in rodents,
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.340]   and it turns out in other non-human primates and in humans,
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.980]   there's a replay of spatial information during REM sleep
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.460]   that almost precisely maps to the activity
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.560]   that we experienced during the day
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.260]   as we move from one place to another.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.900]   So here's a common world scenario.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.700]   You go to a new place,
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.600]   you navigate through that city or that environment.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.040]   This place doesn't have to be at the scale of a city.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.280]   It can be a new building,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.940]   could be finding particular rooms, new social interaction.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.520]   You experience that and if it's important enough,
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.360]   that becomes solidified a few days later
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.320]   and you won't forget it.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.480]   If it's unimportant, you'll probably forget it.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.680]   During REM sleep, there's a literal replay
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.660]   of the exact firing of the neurons that occurred
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.480]   while you were navigating that same city
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.720]   you're building earlier.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.760]   So REM sleep seems to be involved in the generation
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.680]   of this detailed spatial information.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.980]   But what is it that's actually happening in REM sleep?
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.880]   So there's this uncoupling of emotion,
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.320]   but most of all what's happening in REM sleep
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.680]   is that we're forming a relationship
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.740]   with particular rules or algorithms.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.060]   We're starting to figure out based on all the experience
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.400]   that we had during the day,
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.560]   whether or not it's important that we avoid certain people
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.940]   or that we approach certain people.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.200]   Whether or not it's important that when we enter a building
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.660]   that we go into the elevator and turn left
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.140]   where the bathroom is, for instance.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.780]   These general themes of things and locations
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.360]   and how they fit together.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.160]   And that has a word, it's called meaning.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.600]   During our day, we're experiencing all sorts of things.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   Meaning is how we each individually piece together
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.560]   the relevance of one thing to the next, right?
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.320]   So if I suddenly told you that this pen
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.720]   was downloading all the information to my brain
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.900]   that was important to deliver this information,
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.980]   you'd probably think I was a pretty strange character
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.700]   because typically we don't think of pens
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.040]   as downloading information into brains.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.940]   But if I told you that I was getting information
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.260]   from my computer that was allowing me to say things to you,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.820]   you'd say, well, that's perfectly reasonable.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.560]   And that's because we have a clear
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.780]   and agreed upon association with computers
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.040]   and information and memory.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.180]   And we don't have that same association with pens.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.660]   You might say, well, duh.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.260]   But something in our brain
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.340]   needs to solidify those relationships
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.380]   and make sure that certain relationships don't exist.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.580]   And it appears that REM sleep is important for that
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.020]   because when you deprive yourself or people of REM,
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.300]   they start seeing odd associations.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.960]   They tend to lump or batch things.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.600]   I know this from my own experience,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.020]   if I've ever been sleep deprived,
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.700]   which unfortunately happens too often
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.660]   because I'm terrible with deadlines, pull an all-nighter,
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.420]   the word the starts to look like it's spelled incorrectly.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.240]   And the is a very simple word to spell,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.960]   but things start to look a little distorted.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.020]   And we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.820]   for very long periods of time, they start hallucinating.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.660]   They literally start seeing relationships
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.340]   and movement of objects that isn't happening.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.620]   And so REM sleep is really where we establish
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.100]   the emotional load, but where we also start discarding
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.260]   of all the meanings that are irrelevant.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.380]   And if you think about emotionality,
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.360]   a lot of over-emotionality or catastrophizing
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.920]   is about seeing problems everywhere.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.980]   And you could imagine why that might occur
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.900]   if you start linking the web of your experience
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.160]   too extensively.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.120]   It's very important in order to have healthy emotional
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.820]   and cognitive functioning, that we have fairly narrow
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.580]   channels between individual things.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.260]   If we see something on the news that's very troubling,
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.580]   well, then it makes sense to be very troubled.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.120]   But if we're troubled by everything
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.560]   and we start just saying, everything is bothering me
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.020]   and I'm feeling highly irritable
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.140]   and everything's just distorting and troubling me,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:40.140]   chances are we are not actively removing the meaning,
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.940]   the connectivity between life experiences
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.860]   as well as we could.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.100]   And that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.180]   So REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:56.380]   to eliminate the meanings that don't matter.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.580]   It's not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter,
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.900]   but it eliminates the meanings that don't matter.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.420]   And that bears a striking resemblance
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.840]   to what happens early in development.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.300]   This isn't a discussion about early in development,
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.440]   but early in development, the reason a baby
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.620]   can't generate coordinated movements
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.080]   and the reason why children can get very emotional
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.020]   about what seems like trivial events
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.780]   or what adults know to be trivial events,
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.180]   like, oh, the ice cream shop is closed
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.340]   and they just kind of, and then the kid just dissolves
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.900]   into a puddle of tears and the parents go,
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.580]   okay, well, it'll be open again another time.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.620]   Children, one of the reasons that they can't
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.380]   generate coordinated movement or place that event
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.540]   of the ice cream shop being closed into a larger context
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.940]   is because they have too much connectivity.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.700]   And much of the maturation of the brain and nervous system
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.580]   that brings us to the point of being emotionally stable,
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.780]   reasonable, rational human beings
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.040]   is about elimination of connections between things.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.360]   So REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   the potential for emotionality between various experiences.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.440]   And that brings us to the absolutely fundamental relationship
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   and similarity of REM sleep to some of the clinical practices
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.120]   that have been designed to eliminate emotionality
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.360]   and help people move through trauma
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.240]   and other troubling experiences,
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.860]   whether or not those troubling experiences
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.160]   are a death in the family or of a close loved one,
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.740]   something terrible that happened to you or somebody else,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.600]   or an entire childhood or some event
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.740]   that in your mind and body is felt as
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.460]   and experienced as bad, terrible, or concerning.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.560]   Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatments
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.560]   such as EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing,
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.700]   or ketamine treatment for trauma,
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.700]   something that recently became legal
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.440]   and is in fairly widespread clinical use.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.740]   Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.660]   at kind of a core level,
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.660]   bear very similar features to REM sleep.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.700]   So let's talk about EMDR first.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.760]   EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing,
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.060]   is something that was developed by a psychologist,
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.000]   Francine Shapiro.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.740]   She actually was in Palo Alto.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.980]   And the story goes that she was walking,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.580]   not so incidentally in the trees and forest behind Stanford,
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.580]   and she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.500]   So this would be from her own life.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.700]   And she realized that as she was walking,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.700]   the emotional load of that experience
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.220]   was not as intense or severe.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:46.620]   She extrapolated from that experience
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.460]   of walking and not feeling as stressed
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.060]   about the stressful event
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.740]   to a practice that she put into work with her clients,
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.160]   with her patients,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.680]   and that now has become fairly widespread.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.260]   It's actually one of the few behavior treatments
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.920]   that are approved by the American Psychological Association
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.320]   for the treatment of trauma.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.580]   What she had her clients and patients do
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.640]   was move their eyes from side to side
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.020]   while recounting some traumatic or troubling event.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.720]   Now this was of course in the clinic,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.160]   and I'm guessing that she removed the walking component
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.280]   and just took the eye movement component to the clinic
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.960]   because while it would be nice to go on therapy sessions
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.300]   with your therapist and take walks,
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.960]   it has, there are certain boundaries to that
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.200]   such as confidentiality.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.520]   If there are a lot of people around,
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.360]   the person might not feel as open to discussing things
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.880]   or weather barriers and things like that.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.680]   If it's raining or hailing outside, it gets tough to do.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.420]   Why eye movements?
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.100]   Well, she never really said why eye movements,
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.720]   but soon I'll tell you why the decision
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.160]   to select these lateralized eye movements
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.280]   for the work in the clinic was the right one.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.960]   So these eye movements, they look silly.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.060]   I'll do them because that's why I'm here.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.360]   They look silly, but they basically involve
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.880]   sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side to side,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.360]   not while talking, but for me,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.120]   and then recounting the events.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.720]   So it's sometimes talking while moving the eyes,
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.640]   but usually it was moving the eyes from side to side
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.140]   for 30, 60 seconds,
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.440]   then describing this challenging procedure.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.360]   Now, as a vision scientist who also works on stress,
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.600]   when I first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.280]   People would ask me about EMDR
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.040]   and I just thought, that's crazy.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.600]   I went and looked up some of the theories
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.860]   about why EMDR might work.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.360]   And there were a bunch of theories.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.240]   Oh, it mimics the eye movements during REM sleep.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.680]   That was one, turns out that's not true.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.080]   And I'll explain why.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.740]   The other one was, oh, it synchronizes the activity
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.480]   on the two sides of the brain.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.360]   Well, sort of, I mean, when you look into both sides
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.600]   of the binocular visual field,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.120]   you activate the visual cortex,
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.500]   but this whole idea of synchrony
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.860]   between the two sides of the brain
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.640]   is something that I think modern neuroscience
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.640]   is starting to, let's just say gently or not so gently,
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.660]   move away from this whole right brain, left brain business.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.760]   It turns out, however, that eye movements of the sort
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.160]   that I just did and that Francine Shapiro took
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.600]   from this walk experience and brought to her clients
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.700]   in the clinic are the sorts of eye movements
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.180]   that you generate whenever you're moving through space,
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.520]   when you are self-generating that movement.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.840]   So not so much when you're driving a car,
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.640]   but certainly if you were riding a bicycle
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.680]   or you were walking or you were running,
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.520]   you don't realize it,
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.780]   but you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.600]   that go from side to side.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.240]   And they are associated with the motor system.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.080]   So when you move forward, your eyes go like this.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.660]   There've been a number of studies showing
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.780]   that these lateralized eye movements helped people
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:00.340]   move through or dissociate the emotional experience
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.720]   of particular traumas with those experiences
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.160]   such that they could recall those experiences
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.400]   after the treatment and not feel stressed about them
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.160]   or they didn't report them as traumatic any longer.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.080]   Now, the success rate wasn't 100%,
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.480]   but they were statistically significant in a number of studies
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.200]   and yet there are still some critics of EMDR
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.040]   and frankly, for a long time, I still thought,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.420]   well, I don't know, this just seems like kind of a hack.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.920]   It just seems like kind of a,
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.840]   this is something that for which we don't know the mechanism
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.080]   and we can't explain.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.760]   But in the last five years,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.400]   there have been no fewer than five
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.960]   and there's a sixth on the way,
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.680]   high quality peer-reviewed manuscripts published
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.580]   in Journal of Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell Press Journal,
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:48.520]   Excellent Journal, Nature, Excellent Journal.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.520]   These are very stringent journals and papers
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.680]   showing that lateralized eye movements
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.100]   of the sort that I just did,
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.160]   and if you're just listening to this,
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.280]   it's just sweep that moving the eyes from side to side
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.800]   with eyes open, that those eye movements,
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.960]   but not vertical eye movements,
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.560]   suppress the activity of the amygdala,
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.760]   which is this brain region that is involved
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.280]   in threat detection, stress, anxiety, and fear.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.540]   There are some forms of fear that are not amygdala dependent,
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.260]   but the amygdala, it's not a fear center,
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.560]   but it is critical for the fear response
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.480]   and for the experience of anxiety.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.380]   So that's interesting.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.360]   We've got a clinical tool now
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.080]   that indeed shows a lot of success
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.820]   in a good number of people,
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.000]   where eye movements from side to side
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.360]   are suppressing the amygdala.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.180]   And the general theme is to use those eye movements
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.120]   to suppress the fear response
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.260]   and then to recount or repeat the experience
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.240]   and over time uncouple the heavy emotional load,
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.160]   the sadness, the depression, the anxiety,
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.000]   the fear from whatever it was that happened
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.320]   that was traumatic.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.000]   This is important to understand
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.400]   because I'd love to be able to tell somebody
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.720]   who had a traumatic experience
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.640]   that they would forget that experience.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   But the truth is you never forget the traumatic experience.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.040]   What you do is you remove the emotional load.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.980]   Eventually it really does lose its potency.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.600]   The emotional potency is alleviated.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.100]   Now, EMDR, I should just mention,
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.800]   tends to be most successful for single event
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.000]   or very specific kinds of trauma that happen over and over
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.040]   as opposed to say an entire childhood or an entire divorce.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.900]   They tend to be, it tends to be most effective
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.580]   for single event kinds of things, car crashes, et cetera,
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.940]   where people can really recall the events
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.940]   in quite a lot of detail.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.840]   So it's not for everybody and it should be done,
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.380]   if it's going to be done for trauma,
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.100]   it should be done in a clinical setting
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.040]   with somebody who's certified to do this.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.120]   But that bears a lot of resemblance to REM sleep, right?
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.400]   This experience in our sleep where our eyes are moving,
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.900]   moving, excuse me, although in a different way,
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.580]   but we don't have the chemical epinephrine
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.820]   in order to generate the fear response
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.840]   and yet we're remembering the event
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.780]   from the previous day or days.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.740]   Sometimes in REM sleep,
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.740]   we think about things that happened a long, long time ago.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.260]   So that's interesting.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.100]   And then now there's this new treatment,
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.540]   this chemical treatment with the drug ketamine,
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.100]   which also bears a lot of resemblance
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.820]   to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep.
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.340]   Ketamine is getting a lot of attention now
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.300]   and I think a lot of people
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.860]   just don't realize what ketamine is.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.460]   Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.440]   It is remarkably similar to the drug called PCP,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to use.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.980]   Ketamine and PCP both function to disrupt the activity
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.560]   of a particular receptor in the brain
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.140]   This is a receptor that's in the surface of neurons
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.700]   or on the surface of neurons
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.580]   for which most of the time it's not active.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.220]   But when something very extreme happens
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.780]   and there's a lot of activity in the neural pathway
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.860]   that impinges on that receptor,
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   it opens and it allows the entry of molecules, ions,
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.340]   that trigger a cellular process
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.840]   that we call long-term potentiation.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.060]   And long-term potentiation translates
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.240]   to a change in connectivity
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.200]   so that later you don't need that intense event
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.780]   for the neuron to become active again.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.400]   Let me clarify a little bit of this.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.260]   The NMDA receptor is gated by intense experience.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.040]   One way you can think about this
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.760]   is typically I walk in my home,
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.580]   I might make some food and sit down at my kitchen table
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.920]   and I don't think anything about explosions.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.620]   But were I to come home one night,
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.660]   sit down to a bowl of chicken soup
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.500]   and there was a massive explosion,
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.580]   the neurons that are associated with chicken soup
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.280]   in my kitchen table would be active
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.640]   in a way that was different than they were previously
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.700]   and would be coupled to this experience of explosions
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.260]   such that the next time and perhaps every other time
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.820]   that I go to sit down at the kitchen table,
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.740]   no matter how rational I am
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.480]   about the origins of that explosion,
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.980]   maybe it was a gas truck that was down the road
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.420]   and there's no reason to think it's there today,
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.560]   but I would have the same experience.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.780]   Those neurons would become active
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.500]   and I'd get an increase in heart rate,
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.300]   I'd get an increase in sweating, et cetera.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.500]   Ketamine blocks this NMDA receptor
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.740]   and prevents that crossover and the addition of meaning
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.440]   to the kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me,
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.720]   chicken soup explosion experience.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.820]   So how is ketamine being used?
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:47.900]   Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of emotions
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.840]   very soon after trauma.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.680]   So ketamine is being stocked
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.220]   in a number of different emergency rooms
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.620]   where if people are brought in quickly
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.800]   and these are hard to describe even,
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.480]   but a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.160]   next to them killed in a car accident
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.240]   and they were driving that car.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.300]   This isn't for everybody, certainly,
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.900]   and you need to talk to your physician,
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.640]   but ketamine is being used
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.860]   so they might infuse somebody with ketamine
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.500]   so that their emotion, it can still occur,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.580]   but that the plasticity,
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.220]   the change in the wiring of their brain
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.700]   won't allow that intense emotion
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.420]   to be attached to the experience.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.720]   Now, immediately you can imagine
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.220]   the sort of ethical implications of this, right?
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.700]   Because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.520]   I'm not saying that people should be using ketamine
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.500]   or shouldn't be using ketamine,
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.500]   certainly not recreationally, it's quite dangerous.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.780]   It can be lethal and like PCP,
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.900]   it can cause pretty dramatic changes
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.420]   in perception and behavior.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.020]   But in the clinical setting,
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.980]   the basis of ketamine assisted therapies
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.480]   is really to remove emotion.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.980]   And I think the way I've been hearing about it
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.620]   talked about in the general public
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.860]   is a lot of people think it's a little bit more like
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:02.120]   the kind of psilocybin trials or the MDMA trials
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.460]   where it's about becoming more emotional
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.660]   or getting in touch with a certain experience.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.420]   Ketamine is about becoming dissociative
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.420]   or removed from the emotional component of experience.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.260]   So now we have ketamine,
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.380]   which chemically blocks plasticity
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.380]   and prevents the connection
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.780]   between an emotion and an experience.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.140]   That's a pharmacologic intervention.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.320]   We have EMDR, which is this eye movement thing
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.520]   that is designed to suppress the amygdala
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.820]   and is designed to remove emotionality
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.860]   while somebody recounts an experience.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.960]   And we have REM sleep where the chemical epinephrine
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.180]   that allows for signaling of intense emotion
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.060]   and the experience of intense emotion
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.020]   in the brain and body is not allowed.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.740]   And so we're starting to see a organizational logic,
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.880]   which is that a certain component of our sleeping life
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.780]   is acting like therapy.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.900]   And that's really what REM sleep is about.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.080]   So we should really think about REM sleep
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.340]   and slow wave sleep as both critical,
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.740]   slow wave sleep for motor learning and detailed learning,
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.780]   REM sleep for attaching of emotions
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.420]   to particular experiences,
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.260]   and then for making sure that the emotions
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.740]   are not attached to the wrong experiences
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.320]   and for unlearning emotional responses
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.580]   if they're too intense or severe.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.280]   And this all speaks to the great importance
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.080]   of mastering one's sleep,
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.620]   something that we talked about in episode two of the podcast
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.780]   and making sure that if life has disruptive events,
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.160]   either due to travel or stress
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.140]   or changes in school or food schedule,
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.600]   something that we talked about in episodes three and four,
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.520]   that one can still grab a hold and manage one's sleep life.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.500]   Because fundamentally the unlearning of emotions
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.860]   that are troubling to us
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.660]   is what allows us to move forward in life.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.900]   And indeed the REM deprivation studies show
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.980]   that people become hyper-emotional,
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.780]   they start to catastrophize.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.580]   And it's no surprise therefore
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.980]   that sleep disturbances correlate
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.180]   with so many emotional and psychological disturbances.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.980]   It's just by now it should just be obvious
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.540]   why that will be the case.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.300]   In fact, the other day I was in a discussion
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.480]   with a colleague of mine who's down in Australia,
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.900]   Dr. Sarah McKay, I've known her for two decades now
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.320]   from the time she was at Oxford.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.620]   And Sarah studies, among other things,
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.020]   menopause in the brain.
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.860]   And she was saying that a lot of the emotional effects
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.700]   of menopause actually are not directly related
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.540]   to the hormones.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.140]   There've been some really nice studies showing
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.980]   that the disruptions in temperature regulation in menopause
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:44.400]   map to changes in sleep regulation
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.860]   that then impact emotionality
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.540]   and an inability to correctly adjust the circuits
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.220]   related to emotionality.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.020]   And I encourage you to look at her work.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.700]   We'll probably have her as a guest on the podcast
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.700]   at some point in the future
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.600]   'cause she's so knowledgeable about those sorts of issues
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.560]   as well as issues related to testosterone
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.440]   and in people with all sorts
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.680]   of different chromosomal backgrounds.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:10.260]   So sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:13.820]   of energy, it's not just deprivation of immune function.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.580]   It is deprivation of self-induced therapy
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.740]   every time we go to sleep, okay?
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.180]   So these things like EMDR and ketamine therapies
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.300]   are in clinic therapies,
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.620]   but REM sleep is the one that you're giving yourself
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.600]   every night when you go to sleep,
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.740]   which raises, I think, the other important question,
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.060]   which is how to get and how to know
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.300]   if you're getting the appropriate amount
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.140]   of REM sleep and slow wave sleep.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.900]   So that's what we'll talk about next.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:44.420]   So how should one go about getting the appropriate amount
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.460]   of slow wave sleep and REM sleep
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.980]   and knowing that you're getting the right amount?
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.340]   Well, short of hooking yourself up to an EEG,
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.620]   it's going to be tough to get exact measurements
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.680]   of brain states from night to night.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.460]   Some people nowadays are using things like the aura ring
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.580]   or a whoop band or some other device
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.260]   to measure the quality and depth
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.320]   and duration of their sleep.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.920]   And for many people, those devices can be quite useful.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.200]   Some people are only gauging their sleep
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.880]   by way of whether or not they feel rested,
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.520]   whether or not they feel like they're learning
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.240]   and they're getting better or not.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.820]   There are some things that one can really do.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.300]   And the first one might surprise you
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.440]   in light of everything I've said
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   and probably everything you've heard about sleep.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.520]   There was a study done by a Harvard undergraduate,
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.520]   Emily Hoagland, who was in Robert Strickgold's lab
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.920]   at the time.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   And that study explored how variations
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.680]   in total sleep time related to learning
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:53.480]   as compared to total sleep time itself.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.960]   And to summarize the study, what they found
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.100]   was that it was more important
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:04.700]   to have a regular amount of sleep each night
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:08.300]   as opposed to the total duration.
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.620]   In other words, and what they showed
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   was that improvements in learning or deficits in learning
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.060]   were more related to whether or not you got six hours,
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.340]   six hours, five hours, six hours.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:25.000]   That was better than if somebody got, for instance,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   six hours, 10 hours, seven hours, four or five hours.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.320]   So you might say, well, that's crazy
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.560]   because I thought we were just all supposed
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.920]   to get more sleep and there's more REM towards morning.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.680]   Turns out that for sake of learning new information
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.440]   and performance on exams in particular,
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.020]   that's what was measured, limiting the variation
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.980]   in the amount of your sleep is at least as important
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.100]   and perhaps more important
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.720]   than just getting more sleep overall.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.480]   And I think this will bring people great relief,
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.120]   many people great relief who are struggling
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.200]   to quote unquote get enough sleep.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.080]   Remember a few episodes ago,
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:10.080]   I talked about the difference between fatigue and insomnia.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.080]   You know, fatigue tends to be when we are tired,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.480]   insomnia tends to lead to a sleepiness during the day
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.840]   when we're falling asleep.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.880]   And you don't want that.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.120]   You don't want either of those things really.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:25.560]   But I found it striking that the data from this study
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.440]   really point to the fact that consistently getting
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.280]   about the same amount of sleep
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.920]   is better than just getting more sleep.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.160]   And I think nowadays so many people
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.720]   are just aiming for more sleep
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.320]   and they're rather troubled about the fact
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.060]   that they're only getting five hours
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.240]   or they're only getting six hours in some cases.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.520]   It may be the case that they are sleep deprived
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.960]   and they need more sleep,
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.180]   but some people just have a lower sleep need.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:53.400]   And I find great relief personally in the fact
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.100]   that consistently getting for me about six hours
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.860]   or six and a half hours is going to be more beneficial
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.880]   than constantly striving for eight or nine
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.680]   and finding that some nights I'm getting five
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.600]   and sometimes I'm getting nine and varying around the mean.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.940]   As I recall, and I think I'm going to get this
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.000]   precisely right, but if not, I know that I'm at least close.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.400]   For every hour variation in sleep,
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.420]   regardless of whether or not it was more sleep
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.240]   than one typically got,
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.440]   there was a 17% reduction in performance
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.880]   on this particular exam type.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.660]   And so this is powerful.
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.180]   This means that we should strive
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.680]   for a regular amount of sleep.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.620]   And for some of us, that means falling asleep
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.920]   and waking up and going back to sleep.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.760]   For some people it means falling asleep
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.740]   and waking up and not getting back to sleep.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.560]   Now, ideally you're getting the full compliment
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.580]   of slow wave sleep early at night
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.840]   and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep,
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.560]   which brings us to how to get more REM sleep.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.760]   Well, there are a couple of different ways,
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:56.760]   but here's how to not get more REM sleep, all right?
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.560]   First of all, drink a lot of fluid
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.880]   right before going to sleep.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.320]   One of the reasons why we wake up
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.200]   in the middle of the night to use the bathroom
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.880]   is because when our bladder is full,
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.480]   there is a neural connection,
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.840]   literally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.760]   that goes to the brainstem that wakes us up.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.600]   And actually some people that I know
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.800]   and I won't be mentioned,
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.380]   actually use this to try and adjust for their jet lag
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:22.320]   when they're trying to stay awake.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.600]   Having to use the bathroom, having to urinate
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.680]   is one of the most anxiety-evoking experiences
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.560]   anyone can have.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.160]   If you really have to go to the bathroom,
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.540]   it's very hard to fall asleep or stay asleep.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:36.840]   And bedwetting, which happens in kids very early on,
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:41.840]   is a failure of those circuits to mature until,
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.300]   I think we all assume that babies
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.960]   are going to pee in their sleep,
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.160]   but adults aren't supposed to do that.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.260]   And the circuits take some time to develop
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.800]   and in some kids they develop a little bit later
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.920]   than others.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.700]   So having a full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.200]   You don't want to go to bed dehydrated,
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.400]   but that's one way.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.400]   On the other hand, there is evidence
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.960]   that if you want to remember your dreams more
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.800]   or remember more of your dreams,
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.480]   there is a tool that you can use,
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.120]   I don't necessarily recommend it,
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.480]   which is to drink a bunch of water before you go to sleep.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   And then what happens is you tend to break
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.440]   in and out of REM sleep, it tends to be fractured.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.620]   And with a sleep journal,
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.140]   they've done these laboratory studies, believe it or not,
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.020]   people will recall more of their dreams
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.920]   because they're in this kind of semi-conscious state
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.260]   because they're constantly waking up throughout the night.
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.740]   I suggest not having a full bladder before you go to sleep.
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.220]   That one's kind of an obvious one, but nonetheless.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:39.940]   The other one is if you recall that during REM sleep,
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.420]   we have a shift in neurotransmitters
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:47.420]   such that we have less serotonin, right?
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.600]   Just want to make sure I got that right, excuse me.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.840]   Less serotonin.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.820]   There are a lot of supplements out there
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:58.200]   geared toward improving sleep.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.720]   I've taken some of them and I've taken many of them,
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.120]   if not all of them at this point,
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.720]   so I could report back to you.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.400]   And I think I mentioned on a previous episode
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.220]   that when I take tryptophan or anything
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:11.640]   that contains 5-HTP, which is serotonin
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.860]   or a precursor to serotonin,
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.720]   serotonin is made from tryptophan,
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.440]   I tend to fall very deeply asleep
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.200]   and then wake up a few hours later.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.080]   And that makes sense now based on the fact
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.160]   that you just don't want a lot of REM sleep early on.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.120]   What was probably happening
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:27.000]   is that I was getting a lot of REM sleep early on
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.540]   because low levels of serotonin
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.740]   are typically associated with slow wave sleep
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.200]   and that comes early in the night.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.320]   So for some people, those supplements might work,
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.920]   but beware serotonin supplements
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:42.720]   could disrupt the timing of REM sleep and slow wave sleep.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.660]   And in my case led to waking up
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:46.220]   very shortly after going to sleep
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.700]   and not being able to get back to sleep.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:52.340]   Now, if you want to increase your slow wave sleep,
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.840]   that's interesting, there are ways to do that.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.200]   One of the most powerful ways to increase slow wave sleep,
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.920]   the percentage of slow wave sleep,
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.360]   apparently without any disruption
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.680]   to the other components of sleep and learning
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.400]   is to engage in resistance exercise.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.600]   It's pretty clear that resistance exercise
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.380]   triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.440]   that lend themselves to release of growth hormone,
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.680]   which happens early in the night.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.080]   And resistance exercise therefore
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.640]   can induce a greater percentage of slow wave sleep.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.400]   It doesn't have to be done very close to going to bedtime.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.360]   In fact, for some people that the exercise
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.240]   could be disruptive for reasons I've talked about
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.680]   in previous episodes,
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:35.920]   but resistance exercise unlike aerobic exercise
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.240]   does seem to increase the amount of slow wave sleep,
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.480]   which as we know is involved in motor learning
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.260]   and the acquisition of fine detailed information,
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:48.100]   not general rules or the emotional components of experiences.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.340]   For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.960]   and would like to increase the amount of lucid dreaming
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.480]   that you're experiencing,
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.540]   I haven't been able to track down that device
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:01.340]   with the red light that I described at the beginning,
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.760]   but there are a number of just simple zero technology tools
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.720]   that one could use in principle.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.020]   One is to set a cue.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.960]   The way this works is you come up with a simple statement
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.060]   about something that you'd like to see
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.620]   or experience later in dreams.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:25.940]   You can, for instance, write down something like,
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.040]   I want to remember the red apple.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.980]   I know it sounds silly and trivial.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.440]   And you look at that,
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.180]   you would probably want to write it down
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.020]   on a piece of paper.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.780]   You might even want to draw a red apple.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.500]   And then before you go to sleep, you would look at it.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.780]   And then you would just go to sleep.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.020]   There are some reports that doing that
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.840]   for several days in a row can lead to a situation
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.420]   in which you are suddenly in your dream
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.100]   and you remember the red apple.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.940]   And that gives you a sort of tether to reality
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.320]   between the dream state and reality
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.220]   that allows you to navigate and shape
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.060]   and kind of adjust your dreams.
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.940]   Lucid dreaming does not have to be
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.540]   or include the ability to alter features of the dream,
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.700]   to be able to control things in the dream.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.300]   Sometimes it's just the awareness that you are dreaming.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.620]   But nonetheless, some people enjoy lucid dreaming.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.880]   And then for people that have a lot of lucid dreams
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.900]   that feel kind of overwhelmed by those,
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:23.900]   that's going to involve trying to embrace protocols
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.060]   that can set the right duration of sleep.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.180]   There's a little bit of literature, not a lot,
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:33.960]   that shows that keeping the total amount of sleep per night
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.580]   to say six hours such that you begin sleep and end
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.780]   at the beginning and end of one of these ultradian cycles
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.560]   can be better than waking up in the middle
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.060]   of one of these ultradian cycles.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:49.060]   So try and find the right amount of sleep that you need
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.080]   that's right for you.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.320]   And then try and get that consistently night to night.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.060]   If you're a lucid dreamer and you don't like it,
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.920]   then you may want to start to make sure
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.080]   that you're waking up at the end
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.460]   of one of these ultradian cycles.
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:04.000]   So in this case, it would be better to wake up
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.940]   after six hours than after seven.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.060]   And if you did sleep longer than six hours,
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.900]   maybe you'd want to get to seven and a half hours
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.280]   'cause that's going to reflect the end
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.620]   of one of these 90 minute cycles
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.520]   as opposed to waking up in the middle.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.780]   Alcohol, alcohol and marijuana are well known
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.920]   to induce states that are pseudo sleep-like,
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.240]   especially when people fall asleep
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.380]   after having consumed alcohol or THC,
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.780]   the active component,
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.840]   one of the active components in marijuana.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:36.620]   Alcohol, THC and most things like them,
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.680]   meaning things that increase serotonin or GABA
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.720]   are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.900]   They're going to disrupt the depth,
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.180]   they're going to disrupt the overall sequencing
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.820]   of more slow wave sleep early in the night
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.500]   and more REM sleep later in the night.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.220]   That's just the reality.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:56.420]   There are some things that at least in a few studies
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.740]   that I could find seem to suggest
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.740]   that you could increase the amount of slow wave sleep
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.900]   using things like arginine, the amino acid L-arginine,
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.820]   although you really want to check,
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.920]   arginine can have effects on heart, et cetera,
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.280]   has other effects.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.500]   But alcohol, THC, not going to be great
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.680]   for sleep and depth of sleep.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.560]   You might feel like you can fall asleep faster,
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.360]   but the sleep that you're accessing
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.500]   really isn't the kind of deep restorative sleep
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.900]   that you should be getting.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.960]   Now, of course, if that's what you need in order to sleep
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.120]   and that's within your protocols, I've said here before,
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.420]   I'm not suggesting people take anything,
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.580]   I'm not a medical doctor, I'm not a cop,
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.580]   so I'm not trying to regulate anyone's behavior,
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.480]   I'm just telling you what the literature says.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.800]   Some of you may want to explore your dreams
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.580]   and meaning of dreams, et cetera.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.940]   There's not a lot of hard data about how to do this,
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.220]   but a lot of people report keeping a sleep journal
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.280]   where a dream journal can be very useful.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.300]   So they mark when they think they fell asleep
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.180]   the night before, when they woke up,
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.300]   and if they wake up in the middle of the night
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.860]   early in the morning, they'll just write down
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.660]   what they can recall of their dreams.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.860]   And even if they recall nothing,
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.600]   many people have the experience of mid-morning
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.180]   or later afternoon that suddenly comes to them
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.100]   that they had a dream about something and writing that down.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.820]   I kept a dream journal for a while,
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.300]   it didn't really afford me much,
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.900]   I didn't really learn anything
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.000]   except that my dreams were very bizarre,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.060]   but there are some things that happen in dreams
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.840]   that are associated with REM sleep
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.300]   as it compared to slow wave sleep,
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.120]   which can tell you whether or not your dream
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.920]   likely happened in REM sleep or slow wave sleep.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.860]   And the distinguishing feature it turns out
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.920]   is something called theory of mind.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.720]   Theory of mind is actually an idea that was developed
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.460]   for the study and assessment of autism.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.520]   And it was initially that phrase theory of mind
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.020]   was brought about by Simon Baron Cohen,
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:51.500]   who is Sasha Baron Cohen, the comedian's brother.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.480]   Simon Baron Cohen is a psychologist
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.460]   and to some extent a neuroscientist at Oxford.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.860]   And theory of mind tests are done on children.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:05.220]   And the theory of mind test is somewhat like the following.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.420]   A child is brought into a laboratory
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.060]   and watches a video of a child
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.820]   playing with some sort of toy.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.540]   And then at the end of playing with that toy,
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.100]   they put the toy in a drawer and they go away.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.480]   And then another child comes in and is looking around.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.780]   And then the experimenter asks the child
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.820]   who's in the experiment, the real child and says,
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.780]   what does the child think?
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.140]   What are they feeling?
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:35.500]   And most children of a particular age,
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.640]   five or six or older will say,
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.420]   oh, he or she is confused.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.580]   They don't know where the toy is.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.280]   Or they'll say something that implies
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.720]   what we call theory of mind.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.620]   That they can put their ideas and their mind
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.480]   into what the other child is likely to be feeling
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.320]   or experiencing.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.720]   That's theory of mind.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.280]   And it turns out that this is used
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.880]   as one of the assessments for autism
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.300]   because some children, not all,
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.580]   but some children that have autism
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.940]   or that go on to develop autism
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.620]   don't have this theory of mind.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.000]   They tend to fixate on the fact
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.080]   that the first child put the toy in the drawer.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.660]   They'll say it's in the drawer
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.580]   as opposed to answering the question,
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.240]   which is how does the second child feel about it?
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.580]   Or what are they experiencing?
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:24.220]   So theory of mind is something that emerges early in life
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:27.080]   as a part of the maturation of the circuits in the brain
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:31.900]   associated with emotional learning and social interactions.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.440]   And we experience this in certain dreams.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.420]   So if you had a dream that you're puzzled about
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.740]   or that you're fixated on and you're thinking about,
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.960]   you might ask, in that dream,
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.440]   was I assessing somebody else's emotion and feeling
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.660]   or was I very much in my own first person experience?
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.260]   And the tendency is that theory of mind
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:58.260]   tends to show up most in these REM associated dreams.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:00.420]   Now this isn't a hard and fast rule,
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.420]   but chances are if you were in a dream
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.420]   and you were thinking about other people
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.020]   who wanted to do something to you,
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.060]   you were thinking about their desire to chase you
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:12.660]   or help you or something that was really related
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.340]   to someone else's emotional experience,
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.400]   it was probably a REM dream.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.580]   That dream occurred in rapid eye movement sleep
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.620]   as opposed to slow wave sleep.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.720]   And that makes sense when you think about the role of REM
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.720]   in emotional unlearning of associations
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.060]   with particular life events,
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.920]   that REM is rich with all sorts of exploration
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.720]   of the emotional load of being chased
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.840]   or the emotional load of having to take an exam the next day
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.560]   or being late for something.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.400]   But again, if you're fixated
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.220]   or you can recall thinking a lot about
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.760]   or feeling a lot about what somebody else's motivations were
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.700]   then chances are it was in REM
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.720]   and if not, chances are it was in slow wave sleep.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   Today we've been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming,
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.780]   learning and unlearning.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.120]   And I just want to recap a few of the highlights
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.520]   and important points.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.440]   A lot more slow wave sleep and less REM early in the night,
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.960]   more REM and less slow wave sleep later in the night.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.840]   REM sleep is associated with intense experiences
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.920]   without this chemical epinephrine
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.600]   that allows us the anxiety or fear
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.080]   and almost certainly has an important role
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.600]   in uncoupling of emotion from experiences,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.040]   kind of self-induced therapy that we go into each night.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.120]   That bears striking resemblance to things like EMDR
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.640]   and ketamine therapies and so forth.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.780]   Slow wave sleep is critical however,
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.660]   it's critical mostly for motor learning
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.740]   and the learning of specific details.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.460]   So REM is kind of emotions and general themes
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.760]   and meaning and slow wave sleep, motor learning and details.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.400]   I personally find it fascinating that consistency of sleep,
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.000]   meaning getting six hours every night
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.260]   is better than getting 10 one night,
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.520]   eight the next, five the next, four the next.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.260]   I find that fascinating and I think I also like it
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.000]   because it's something I can control better
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.160]   than just trying to sleep more,
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.280]   which I think I'm not alone in agreeing
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.680]   that that's just hard for a lot of people to do.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.640]   This episode also brings us to the conclusion
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.840]   of a five episode streak where we've been focusing on sleep
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.000]   and transitions in and out of sleep, non-sleep depressed.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.600]   We've talked about a lot of tools, morning light,
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.000]   evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements,
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.080]   tools for measuring sleep duration and quality.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.580]   We've been covering a lot of themes.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.540]   I like to think that by now you're armed
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.480]   with a number of tools and information,
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.060]   things like knowing when your temperature minimum is,
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.080]   knowing when you might want to view light or not,
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.300]   when you might want to eat or take hot showers
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.080]   or God forbid a cold shower,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.520]   something that most people including me more or less loathe
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.480]   but can have certain benefits.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.240]   And that will allow you to shape your sleep life
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.460]   and get this consistent or more or less consistent amount
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.040]   of sleep on a regular basis.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.280]   Nobody's perfect.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.900]   In fact, I have this little joke
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.560]   that I sometimes tell it's not funny.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.220]   Like most of the jokes I tell, I'm told they're not funny,
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.240]   but you know, there's so much excitement now
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.020]   about intermittent fasting.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   Sometimes I think that someone should start something
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.560]   on intermittent sleep deprivation,
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.480]   although we're already doing that.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.960]   We are all experiencing lack of sleep from time to time.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.400]   And I don't think we should catastrophize that too much.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.200]   I think that what we want to do rather
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.120]   than accumulate a sleep anxiety is to, you know,
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:37.180]   if we get a bad night's sleep, we want to adjust.
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:38.540]   We want to get back on track
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.500]   and just get the consistent amount of sleep.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.340]   Use those non-sleep deep rest protocols
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.380]   to help us relax when we're feeling anxious,
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:46.940]   we're having trouble waking up in the middle of the night.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.380]   There are a lot of tools out there
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.680]   and most of them are zero cost.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.440]   And so I hope you'll find those beneficial.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.960]   If you've been hearing Costello
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.640]   snoring throughout this episode,
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.380]   I apologize on his behalf.
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.400]   As I said in the welcome video to this podcast,
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.040]   he's an integral part of the podcast.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.320]   A few people have said, hey,
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.200]   that noise in the background is really disruptive.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.520]   Hey, what can I say?
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.800]   Costello is a 10 year old bulldog mastiff.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.580]   The lifespan on those animals is about 10 years.
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.900]   So I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.520]   but after he's gone, there won't be any snoring,
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.080]   although I'll probably get a different dog.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.840]   So sort of a, what would the kids say?
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.800]   Sorry, not sorry.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.080]   Sorry, not sorry about the snoring.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.020]   And I'm sorry if it's disruptive genuinely,
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.080]   but he's here for the hall.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.080]   So that's what that's about.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.220]   As we close out this segment on sleep,
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.300]   we are moving into a new theme and topic
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.420]   for the next four to five episodes.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.580]   We are going to discuss the science
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:50.060]   and the tools related to neuroplasticity.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.840]   Neuroplasticity is a remarkable feature
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.040]   of the nervous system.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.840]   In fact, it's the defining feature of the nervous system,
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.480]   which is its ability to change itself
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.140]   in response to experience.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.680]   That is unlike every other tissue
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.480]   and collection of cells and organ in our body.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.300]   It's really what makes us us as a species
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:12.260]   and it's what makes us us as individuals.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:14.700]   And it's really where our potential lies.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.400]   Everything that we know, everything we can do
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.180]   and our true potential in terms of what we will ever
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.120]   be able to know, do, say in life
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.180]   is set by the limits of neuroplasticity.
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.740]   So we're going to explore learning in childhood,
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:30.980]   learning in adulthood.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.740]   We're going to discuss detailed protocols
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:37.140]   as they relate to sensory plasticity,
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.100]   learning new sensory information versus motor plasticity
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.160]   or sensory motor integration.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.300]   We're going to talk about language acquisition.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.040]   We're going to be talking about emotional acquisition
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.500]   and breadth, as well as I think a topic
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.300]   a lot of people are going to find fascinating
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.540]   is the relationship between plasticity set
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.700]   during childhood attachment to parent or other caregiver
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:01.140]   and how that maps onto adult relationships.
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.840]   You know, there's many of you have probably heard
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.980]   about secure attached or insecure attached
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.520]   the A, B and C babies as they're called
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.980]   from the classic studies of Bowlby and others.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.300]   But now there's actual neuroscience that can say
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.260]   which circuits were active
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.980]   during those early life attachment
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:22.620]   and how those map to adult attachment styles, challenges
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:25.380]   and what makes us more likely to select certain partners
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.200]   and styles of attachment, as well as how to change those.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.580]   It's really fascinating.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.660]   And I think neurosciences time has come
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:34.580]   for neuroplasticity.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.060]   We're also going to talk of course about supplements
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.500]   and chemicals and machines and devices that can assist
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.940]   in speeding up the plasticity process
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.500]   or believe it or not, there are some cases
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.660]   where you might want to delay plasticity
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.940]   in order to get more depth of learning
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:51.220]   and have that learning last longer.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:54.740]   Something that is just absolutely spectacular literature.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.300]   So I'm very excited to move on to that topic soon.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.200]   I hope that the tools that you've acquired so far
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.680]   and the knowledge that you've acquired so far
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.140]   is helping you with your self evaluation
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.900]   and experimentation as you see fit
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.860]   and is allowing you to not just sleep better
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.540]   but feel better while you're awake
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:11.660]   and hopefully has set the stage for you to learn better
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:16.180]   as we start to march into the month on neuroplasticity.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.480]   Many of you have asked how you can help support
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.320]   the Huberman Lab Podcast and we greatly appreciate
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.620]   the question.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.980]   You can help support the podcast by subscribing
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:27.380]   to the YouTube channel if you haven't already
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:31.120]   and leaving comments and questions in the comment section.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.180]   If you could subscribe on Apple and or Spotify,
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.380]   that's helpful.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.720]   And there's a place on Apple podcasts to leave a rating
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:44.080]   as well as comments about how you feel about the podcast.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.020]   If you could suggest the podcast to friends and coworkers
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.560]   and anyone else that you think would benefit
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.760]   from the information,
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.120]   that also really helps us get the word out.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.500]   And of course, check out our sponsors
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.600]   because that's a very direct way to help us continue
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.940]   to get this information out to the general public.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.520]   Many of you have asked about supplements
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.300]   and where I personally get my supplements.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.660]   I've partnered with Thorne and I get my supplements
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.760]   from Thorne because by my view,
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.860]   they have the highest level of stringency
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.640]   and precision in terms of what's in the bottle.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.320]   And they also have very, very high quality standards.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.800]   They're partnered with the Mayo Clinic
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.500]   and all the major sports organizations.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.360]   If you want to try Thorne supplements,
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.480]   you can go to Thorne.com.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.480]   So that's Thorne spelled T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.640]   And if you do that, you can see the formulations that I take
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.800]   and you'll also get 20% off, not just those formulations,
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.780]   but anything that Thorne makes.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:44.240]   That's Thorne.com/u/huberman
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.420]   to get 20% off anything that they provide.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.520]   Last but not least, a few people wrote to me
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:54.320]   with some questions/corrections
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.120]   about things that I said in previous podcasts.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.360]   So in keeping with my goal
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.560]   of making the information accurate and clear,
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.440]   I just want to correct myself
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.000]   about a few things that I said.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.960]   One of those, and I'm guessing it probably came
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.920]   from an endocrinologist or somebody else
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.920]   that knows a lot about testicles, said, "Huberman,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.840]   "you mentioned that testosterone is made
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.600]   "by the Sertoli cells of the testes, and it's not.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.740]   "It's made by the Leydig cells of the testes,
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.500]   "and indeed you are correct."
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.440]   And so I want to make sure that I clarify that.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.160]   Testosterone is made by the Leydig cells of the testes,
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.440]   not by the Sertoli cells.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.400]   The Sertoli cells make 5-alpha reductase and aromatase
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.960]   and some other enzymes involved in conversion of testosterone
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.700]   into things like DHT and estrogen.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.020]   So thank you for that correction.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.180]   I genuinely appreciate it.
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.700]   I misspoke.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.880]   The other thing I said was at one point I said,
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.340]   "Typical temperature is 96.8,"
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:52.020]   when I actually meant to say 98.6.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:55.780]   So it was a dyslexic slip on my part, and I apologize.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.740]   I don't know that I'm dyslexic.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.880]   I know I'm being clinically diagnosed with dyslexia,
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.120]   but I swapped them,
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.620]   which sometimes happens when I'm going fast.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.220]   So I apologize.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.060]   I'll use this as a moment to just say,
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.960]   temperature varies a lot across the day and night.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.120]   That was a theme of previous podcasts.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.240]   So we can't really talk about average temperature anyway,
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.260]   but I do want to be clear
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:21.240]   that most people think about average temperature as 98.6.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.500]   I misspoke my error, and I apologize.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.900]   Thank you for joining me
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.040]   in this journey of the nervous system and biology
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.540]   and trying to understand the mechanisms
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.700]   that make us who we are
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:36.080]   and how we function in sleep and in wakefulness.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.140]   It's really an incredible landscape to consider,
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.920]   and I hope that you're getting a lot out of the information.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.640]   As always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.220]   [upbeat music]
