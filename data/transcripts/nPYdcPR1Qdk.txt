[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   the reason I reached out to you originally to say, Hey, is there any way we can get a deal
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.000]   for listeners was because I was like, this is the tool I want to recommend. And so anyone that does
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   the kind of standard monthly membership can get the first month for a dollar with the code, all
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.160]   the hacks. And, you know, that's what I tell people to do. And I would tell them to do it.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.800]   If you didn't have a discount code. We did want to do that and just make it easy for people who
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.560]   have points because everyone has points and no one really knows how to use them. And I can teach
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.040]   you how to do it by hand. You know, we have 30,000 blog posts on one mile at a time. If you want to
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.400]   do this by hand, I don't know who has time to read 30,000 blog posts though. I bet. But if you want
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   to, like, there's an option available to you. You don't have to pay anything, you know, to learn how
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.320]   to do this, but there is a market for people who don't want to do that. They don't want to open
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.440]   30 or 60 browser tabs. They just want to see what their options are, get a sense of what the prices
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   are so that they can do their goal posting as they're earning their points. And just to be like,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.520]   "Okay. Wow. Great to know that I can do San Francisco, Paris with flying blue on the nonstop.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.160]   Didn't realize the fuel surcharges were going to be $450 a person. I'm going to think about that."
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.120]   You know, and be informed and then be able to make a decision and, you know, discuss and contemplate
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.400]   their travel plans. Like that's really what we wanted for Point Me. It was to just help people
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.040]   not feel like the space was completely opaque and impenetrable, that they could
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.520]   be informed and make travel choices. Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.160]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.960]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to optimize and upgrade my own life.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280]   Now, a good portion of the emails I get from you all are about how to best use all the points and
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.240]   miles you've racked up for travel. And while I've covered parts of that in at least a dozen episodes,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.120]   I felt like it's time to have an episode solely focused on booking award travel.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.440]   So for the last few months, I've been trying to track down someone who is truly world-class at
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   this, and I did. So today I'm joined by Tiffany Funk, who knows this game in and out. For the
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.640]   past decade, she's produced, written for, and been the managing editor of One Mile at a Time,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.200]   the largest independently-owned travel and loyalty blog. And she also ran operations at one of the
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.320]   top award-booking services, Points Pros, for nine years. Then she took all that experience to
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.240]   co-found Point Me, one of, if not the best, award-searching product out there. So today,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.480]   we're going to break down the why, when, and how to search for award travel, talk about some of
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.640]   the philosophy about how to think about travel with your points and with your miles. We're going
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.200]   to get tactical so you can confidently put your points and miles to good use. I'm also going to
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000]   try to get a few travel hacks and tips from Tiffany, because after visiting 80-plus countries,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I'm sure she has plenty. So let's get started in just a minute.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.960]   Tiffany, welcome to the show. Thank you for being here.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.000]   Of course. Thank you.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.880]   Yeah. So before we actually talk about the process of booking award travel,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.000]   I just want to talk about why people should even think about award flights. I know I get a lot of
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.200]   people that always email me in and say, "Wouldn't it just be easier if I just redeem all these
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.600]   points for cashback or book in the travel portal?" And I know you've thought about this more than
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.720]   anyone. How do you think about that trade-off? Yeah, that's actually really interesting because
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.320]   my answer three years ago would have been different. And I actually think as we talk
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.600]   today, there's going to be a lot of things where I will say my answer three years ago would have
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.320]   been different, but for right now, this... In general, everyone has points though,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.760]   and no one knows how to use them. And I think there's an intimidation factor and people just
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.520]   think, "Okay, it's hard, but the portal is easy." So I think it's worth knowing what the options are
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.680]   and how to explore your alternatives and just do that comparative shopping.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.000]   Even if you do ultimately end up booking through the portal because the nonstop flight isn't
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.960]   available using a traditional miles and points award, or you decide that actually for this trip,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.720]   economy is fine. And so the value is better through the portal just because of the way the
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.960]   economics have changed in the past couple of years. But ultimately, there is tremendous value
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:17.440]   to be had by leveraging these loyalty programs and their partners and what we refer to as distressed
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.040]   inventory. So the goal of an airline executive who works in loyalty management would be to take
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   all 150 of those seats on a 737 and sell every single seat on the plane for the maximum amount
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.360]   that each passenger was willing to pay. So that might be a $49 web saver special.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.920]   It might be a 65,000 mile redemption. That's what they're trying to do. But at the end of the day,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.800]   if the seat goes out empty, no one gets anything. So because of that, there's this very complicated
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.720]   interaction between the airline, their alliance partners, other partners, where everyone is
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.080]   collaborating in the background to make these seats available in different inventory buckets.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.960]   And that's where the magic of miles and points comes in, because there's frequently opportunities
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.680]   to use points that you didn't even know you had or had access to. But they're one of 25 partners
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.640]   that your credit card or your hotel points can transfer to. You can move them to that program,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.080]   you can get a seat on the same flight you were going to purchase otherwise,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.240]   and you're spending a fraction of the points that you would have.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.680]   Is there a kind of rule of thumb fraction where you're like,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.120]   if using points by transferring them to partners can be two to three times as valuable? I mean,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.520]   I know. I think one of the scariest things is if you Google online, you'll find someone who writes
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.680]   a post about, "I got 25 cents per point booking this crazy thing and I don't want to set the bar
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   there." But is there a place where you're like, "Look, even this feels like a win"?
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.400]   On average, over the time we've been doing this, I typically find that
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.640]   people who are transferring their points to a program and redeeming through
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.080]   the loyalty program charts and those methods, they're getting six to 12 times the value of
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.640]   someone who redeemed through their credit card portal. And I like to make that comparison
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.440]   because when people talk about the value they got for flights, it's frequently not reality-based.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.640]   And what do you mean by that?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.440]   Because ultimately, and this gets into the economics classes that maybe it's been a while
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.480]   since anyone's taken, the ultimate value of a thing is only what you or a comparative
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:42.400]   consumer is willing to pay for it. So that flight from Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi is only worth $25,000
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.320]   if you were ready, willing, prepared, and able to purchase a $25,000 flight to Abu Dhabi. And I don't
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.800]   have anyone in my life for whom that's true. So you can't really say, "Okay, I traded in my
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.280]   70,000 advantage miles for this $25,000 flight," because those 70,000 points are not worth $25,000.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.480]   You would not have paid $25,000. What you would have paid might have been $4,000 if it was a
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.840]   special occasion or something. Even still, I don't know a lot of people who are buying $4,000 to
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.520]   flights to Abu Dhabi. So I like to base it off of what you would have paid booking through the
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.760]   credit card portal, because you would probably, if you were in the credit card portal, seen that
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.520]   price for that flight to Abu Dhabi and been like, "I'm not spending that many hundreds of thousands
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.080]   of points." But 70,000 points is a bargain. And looking at it that way and framing it a little
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.200]   bit more practically. And are there types of travelers for whom that huge multiple is not
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.560]   as valuable, whether it's people flying economy versus splurging for business, only flying
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:49.280]   domestic, international? So it used to be that the best value for your points was very consistently
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.680]   international premium cabins, where you were going to get tremendous outsized value if you were
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.120]   booking, especially a partner, and booking the front of the plane versus if you were trying to
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.880]   use your points domestically. There's so many occasions where I'd see someone be like, "Oh,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.040]   I booked tickets from Phoenix to Orlando, and they were 50,000 per person each way,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.080]   but it was first class." I'm like, "Oh my gosh, you're paying first class on a
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:23.600]   terrible, terrible product." There's nothing first about a Dallas to Orlando experience,
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.840]   regardless. And 50,000 points per person, that would have been enough for you to go to Europe.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.040]   But I've tempered that a bit as I've matured in the space. Some people just really want to
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.680]   go to Orlando. And so that's the best value of their points. There's no value for them in Paris.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:50.320]   It is what it is. And I don't want to be disparaging of other people's travel plans
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.440]   and dreams and things like that. The other thing is that the combination of dynamic pricing
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.880]   and the huge change in airline routing and capacity that we've seen since COVID began
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.960]   means that domestic awards can actually be a phenomenal value. Your flights are very full.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.360]   They're very limited. And again, everyone is playing the same game of not having seats go
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:18.160]   out empty. So there are frequently times where I've seen domestic flights, where if you go to
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:25.280]   buy them last minute, they're setting them at $450, $600 for an economy flight, but you can
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.120]   get them for 7,500 miles. That's a great use of your points, no matter how you slice it.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.400]   And is that domestic economy or business? If domestic economy can be a good deal,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.640]   and international business could be a good deal, it seems like there's probably something good
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.800]   along the whole spectrum. Is there any gap where you're like, "Whoa, if you're interested in this,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.000]   not a good fit"?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.840]   Yeah. So I generally would say that domestic first or business is still not a good deal
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:07.120]   for the most part when using points. And that has gotten worse since COVID because primarily,
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:14.560]   we don't have a lot of people traveling for business anymore. And so the cadence of inventory
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.160]   is different. There's a lot of leisure travelers though, and there's a lot of people who haven't
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.160]   traveled for a few years. And so they're willing to just buy up and pay the extra $100 when they're
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.600]   booking their ticket to have domestic first. And that sort of becomes the thing is the buyup price
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.680]   might not be very high. It might be $100 or $150. But the award price is probably at least double
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   of economy. And maybe that's fine if you're going from 7,500 miles to 15,000 miles. But if you're
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.080]   going from 25,000 miles to 50,000 miles, that's just a huge premium for a recliner.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.880]   Especially when... Yeah. Well, first off, like you said, it's a recliner. There are very few
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:58.800]   other than San Francisco, LA to New York, very few of the routes domestically have a quality
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.960]   business class product. And then internationally... So you said maybe it's $100, $200, $300 buyup.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.040]   I've had cases where... I always had this mantra of like, "I'm never going to pay for business
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.080]   class. That'd be crazy." I've had times where I've looked and it's like $100 more. And it's like,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.240]   "Wow. We have kids. We're traveling with bags. The bag fee is $30."
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.720]   Exactly. Just adding that up by itself. It's like, "Okay, this actually makes sense."
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.080]   Yeah. But internationally, I think whenever I look, it still seems to be like
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.240]   three to five times more expensive to buy a business class ticket than it does a coach
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:39.840]   ticket. So that's where I think you can get another bulk of value. Does anything change
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.960]   now? Pre-pandemic, it was me and my wife, just the two of us. Now it's me, my wife,
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.160]   two kids, and an au pair. So everything has changed.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.000]   Everything has changed in more ways than one. But when it comes to travel,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.200]   if you're playing a game trying to look for five seats... I want to get in, by the way,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.400]   to the actual meat of this conversation, which is "How do you do this?" But if you're someone with...
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.880]   Someone emailed me the other day and said, "Well, we have four kids. We're looking for
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.760]   flights with six of us." What kind of expectations should someone like that have?
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.840]   Because I think looking for one seat is so much easier than looking for four, at least in my
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   experience. And if it's more... So many things are different when
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.560]   you're single than when you have a family. And this is actually one of the things that has long
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.400]   bothered me about the miles and points space. And especially a lot of the influencers are pretty
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:37.280]   consistently younger people with not a lot of ties. And they come from a pretty high socioeconomic
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.040]   status. And so there are a lot of the like... And we're guilty of this. Ben and I, one mile at a
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.440]   time, so much of when we were doing our things, I mean, we had partners, but we had a lot of
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.000]   flexibility. We were both digital nomads. So it's very easy to be like, "Yeah. Buenos Aires for the
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.760]   weekend. Why not?" Once you have other responsibilities and other people in your life
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.160]   and things change. So I'm very sensitive to people who have kids. I will say in your case,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.840]   it's much easier when they're the size that they are, and you don't have school schedules to
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:15.920]   contend with. Once you get into school schedules, I think the expectation needs to be adjusted on
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:24.240]   the earning side of the equation. So if you have, for your listener who has the family of six now,
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.000]   and if they know that they're going to be traveling over comparatively peak dates,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.960]   you're either going to be going over spring break and everyone in your area has spring break at the
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.040]   same time, or you're going to be going like when school gets out or things like that. That's just
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:44.000]   the natural cadence of family travel. You need to solve that ahead of time and earn more points
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.800]   either in a specific program or that can be transferred to a specific program from a variety
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:55.360]   of sources. And we can talk about some of those. Because ultimately, for a price, these airlines
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.760]   are willing to accommodate any lack of flexibility that you have. And you just need to prepare for
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:06.960]   that early and just know that your awards might cost you more in terms of points, but you can't,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.040]   I mean, you could quantify, okay, what is the cost of a connection? What is the cost of a
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:22.000]   mid-con red-eye with toddlers? Right? There's huge costs that aren't the points cost for doing that.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.560]   But if you can stack up a bunch of points in flexible programs, Capital One and Chase and
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.880]   even Built Now, and then transfer those points to Flying Blue, Flying Blue will absolutely have
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.040]   six seats for you from California to Europe during peak dates. You're going to pay some
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.520]   fuel surcharges, but you can know that and you can plan for it and you can budget around it.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   And you can still get a tremendous redemption. It's just different than what a tremendous
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.480]   redemption might have looked like when you were unencumbered. Yeah, I mean, we're looking at a
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:59.520]   trip in February to Belize, which it's so crazy because it's not that far. It's like just a tiny
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.280]   bit further than Cancun, but getting there is like 10 times more complicated because there's
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.560]   no direct flights and a lot of the option. And so we were like, gosh, man, it's going to cost us like,
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:14.800]   you know, 70, 80, 90,000 miles to get there, which in our mind seems crazy for such a short trip.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.480]   But the week that we don't, my daughter doesn't have preschool is the week that all the schools
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:28.160]   are out in February. And the flights are like $1,500, $2,000 if you don't want to fly to Dallas
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.800]   and sit at the airport for seven hours and then get in at 11pm and leave at 5am. And so it's funny
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   because my expectation, it's actually still a good value to use the points. It's just a lot more
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.040]   points than I, you know, it would have been if I was like, "Oh, sure. I'll take the red eye on
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.200]   Wednesday and I'll hang out at an airport for five hours." It's just a different calculus.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:55.040]   So yeah, my takeaway has been the value is still there. It's just more points. And now that it's
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.560]   more points because of the flexibility, the desire to not change planes as much or long layover,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:08.320]   you just need more points. Right. But I will also say that there is a benefit in thinking
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:14.480]   outside of the box with family travel. Any trip that you would take within North America,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.160]   including like Upper Central America and things like that, Belize is a perfect example,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.120]   is going to be expensive because a lot of people think that it's close and it's easy.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.240]   If you were to look instead those same dates and look at going to Thailand,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.680]   I would wager that your travel time is not much longer. You would spend far fewer points. You're
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.560]   still getting to beach. You're getting vastly better food than anything Belize has to offer.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.800]   And you might be surprised, right? It might be something to think about. And I know a lot of
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.920]   parents, especially newer parents are hesitant. They're like, "Oh my gosh, it's a long flight."
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:56.160]   Okay. But is it? It's probably the same travel day. And I did this. I'll actually send you some
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.120]   pictures, Chris, because they're adorable. We took my family, my sister's family and her
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:08.080]   kids. We went to Thailand for a couple of weeks over Christmas and all in everything done,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.440]   we spent about $2,000 per person for 10 days, including like the value of the points.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.040]   And granted I had the points to spend and not everybody has points to do seven people in
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:26.480]   international first class, but again, you can plan for that. And it was great. My nephew was
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.120]   seven at the time, which is a very precarious age for travel because they can't sit still.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.240]   Right. And they're very busy, but he was great. And he loved the flight. He laid down in the bed.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.640]   It was fantastic. We worked with the jet lag and we didn't have to spend 12 hours in DFW,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.880]   which we would have had to do and did the next year when they went to Costa Rica.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.800]   So yeah, in this case, the family has decided this is the family trip. So there's a little
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.560]   bit less flexibility, but you didn't get a vote. That's the other thing about being a parent,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.920]   right? Is your vote share diminishes tremendously as you.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:06.560]   But we're going to start planning more family trips for our extended family. This is an extended
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.600]   family trip where we're like, "Hey, this is the plan this year. This is where we're going.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:17.040]   Let us know if you need help booking it." But I think we can agree. So getting your points
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.080]   and transferring them can be a lot of value. There's almost 30 different airlines you can
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.160]   transfer to amongst all these flexible points programs. I went this morning, I was like,
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.800]   "Okay, if you sum up Amex and Built and Chase and Capital One and Citi, there's 30 airlines.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.680]   And if you look and include their partners, it's almost double that."
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.720]   So I think the best thing is just like, where does someone start to think about this? And I know you
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.600]   guys have a product to do this. So I want to cover both with and without tools. But if someone's
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.160]   like, "Alright, I've saved up the few hundred thousand points I need to take a family on a
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:55.440]   trip anywhere in the world. But what do I do? Amex probably has more than a dozen places you
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.800]   could transfer those points to." How do you think about that if you're someone new to this?
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.840]   Okay, so the very old school way. So I would actually take it back a step. And I would
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.360]   think about this before deciding whether I'm going to get an Amex card or a Chase card or
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.200]   whatever other card. Because while they do have a lot of partners, and there's a lot of leverage,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:21.040]   there are some unique situations where you can't get Amex points to United and you can't get
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:29.680]   Chase points to American Airlines. And because of how airline inventory management has evolved in
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.320]   the past few years, there may be times where you do need points with that domestic carrier,
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.920]   because they are making space available only to members of their program.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.120]   Before we started recording, you mentioned French Polynesia. So if you know that you
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:53.920]   want to go from San Francisco to Papeete, and you're the only carrier that has a points program
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.280]   that flies in nonstop is United. That's a trip where I would probably look at paying cash for
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.080]   the flights because they can actually be pretty reasonable in comparison. And because they are
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.160]   considered South Pacific, the award prices are bonkers. But if you know you're going to want
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.080]   to use miles, you know you're going to need United miles in that case, because they're not going to
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.400]   make space available for partners very, very rarely. So you probably, in that case, want to
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.120]   get the Chase card versus the Amex card. So that's my setting the table for that.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.440]   Otherwise, what I like to do, if we're doing the old school way, I like to go to Wikipedia and look
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:33.440]   at the destination that you're going to, and literally put in CDG for Charles de Gaulle
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.320]   Airport Wiki, and go through and look and see who are the airlines that fly there and where do those
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.880]   airlines fly to. This is the most manual way possible that you can do it, but I think it's
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:49.200]   really helpful because you can look at it and you can be like, "Oh, okay. So I didn't know that Air
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.640]   France flew there from Salt Lake City," or whatever. I actually don't have the Wikipedia page open for
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.920]   the Paris Airport, so I hope that's still true. But you can look at that. And if you cross-reference
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:09.680]   that to then the list of partners for your credit card, you can see like, "Okay. Does Air France
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.840]   fly in blue? Oh, they are a partner of my program. Okay. So that's a good place to start."
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.280]   And that's the baseline. You could go from there. When you get into the more advanced ways,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.520]   it's like, "Okay. Well, what other programs are partners of Air France? And is there an
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:30.880]   arbitrage opportunity by moving my points to some other SkyTeam carrier or some non-Alliance carrier
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:37.520]   and looking at their award charts?" And at this point in time, you should have 30 to 70 browser
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.000]   tabs open. And that's how you know you're doing it right. I want to go back to this example of
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.400]   maybe it's better to have points in the domestic program. So I will say, I got lucky. We were
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.760]   flying last minute, and it was actually cheaper to book through Air Canada's aero plan for the
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.400]   flights to Papiete. Right. But you were booking last minute, which is not how most people plan
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.360]   their trips to Tahiti. Totally. Right? So that's sort of that give and take. If you were like,
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.280]   "Oh, maybe we can go to Tahiti or maybe we'll go to somewhere else." Then that's fine.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:16.480]   But are there programs in general where you're like, "Okay. Flying blue, I think is a great
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.760]   example because they're a partner of most flexible point programs. They have pretty
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.000]   reasonable award prices. Is there a... Okay, I want to go on a common route. I want to go from
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.480]   New York to London." There's probably a quick version of... I would say maybe it's check Air
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:41.280]   France, check United or Air Canada, and check British Airways. And start there. Maybe you find
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.240]   something great before you get to the 60 browser tabs. Right. Well, you said if somebody was
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   brand new and wanted to know, right? So they don't necessarily know where to look.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.360]   So if you're going New York to London, I would look first at Virgin Atlantic. And I would also
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.560]   look at the travel time for New York to London. I've been on a New York London flight that ended
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.640]   up clocking in at 3 hours and 45 minutes. I don't need business class for 3 hours and 45 minutes.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   Right. And that's something to consider too. And Virgin Atlantic will frequently have
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.760]   nylon for like 10,000 points in economy. And that's an incredible bargain. It can be a 4-hour
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.520]   flight. We think of like, "Oh, it's international." But when you're already in New York,
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.680]   it's not that far. So... But again, I think if you were looking at the Heathrow Airport Wikipedia
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.040]   page, you would have been like, "Oh, Virgin Atlantic and they're a partner of all of my
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.080]   credit cards. I can look there." So it's the same method. You don't have to memorize these things.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.200]   I just didn't know if you had like a "Before you get to 60, here's 3 or 4 to start with
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.360]   to see if you find something good." I think it depends where you're going. Right? And
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.040]   people always want me to say like, "Well, this is the best program. And this is the
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.960]   best partner. So we should go." But it really depends. And as we see this trend where loyalty
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.240]   programs are making more and more inventory available exclusively to members of their
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:10.480]   own program, it's better to keep your points flexible than necessarily go all in on that
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.920]   one program. Because what if you can't book something with their partners that you would
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.040]   have expected to be able to book? It's not like the day, back in the day, where
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:29.440]   we moved maybe a billion points from membership rewards to AeroPlan to book Lufthansa first class
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.360]   when it was a 16-seat cabin with no fuel surcharges through AeroPlan. And it didn't even matter.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.760]   There were frequently I would tell people, "No problem. There's space." And then I would go and
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.880]   actually look to see if there was space because there was always space. There were 16 seats in
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.360]   the first class cabin. Of course, there was space. And to be clear, these were client points. You
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.320]   didn't actually have a billion points yourself. Correct. These are other people's points. Yeah.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:57.040]   Yeah. And so things evolve and they change. So one of the great evolutions in the miles and
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:04.400]   point space in the recent comparative years from when I've been in the game has been the advent of
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:10.000]   these flexible points. So you don't have to commit to a single program early on.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.720]   I'm very... It's funny. I always use the United card as the example. People are like, "Oh, I live
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.000]   in the Bay Area. So I have this United card." And I'm like, "Well, even just a chase card might
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.480]   actually earn you more United points than the United card itself. And then those points actually
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.760]   could go to a bunch of other airlines and you don't have to decide until you're planning the trip."
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.640]   Exactly. If you live in the Bay Area, you should have the United card and you should not spend on
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.800]   it. Unless you are purchasing tickets on United, you need the baggage benefit because you're flying
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.680]   economy. And in that case, it makes sense because getting triple points from another card doesn't
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:54.080]   offset the $150 that you would pay in baggage fees. But yeah, don't use it at the grocery store,
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:00.320]   please. Or maybe even for buying United flights. Yeah. I think does United still have that
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.560]   limitation where you only get the baggage benefit on your credit card if you purchased the flight
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.880]   using a United credit card? That is a question I don't know the answer to. Yeah. I don't know
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.480]   it off the top of my head anymore, but it used to be the case. And so that was then my exception of
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.760]   this is the time when you would use that United card. Otherwise, but for the Delta and American
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.680]   cards, have them if you check bags, but don't use them. Yeah. It's funny. I used to be in the
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.080]   why would you ever check bags camp? And it's like, oh, because maybe you have kids. Yeah.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   You mentioned the flexibility, you know, can be what was probably the reason I found such a good
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.000]   deal. If someone's thinking right now, oh, I want to take a trip. And, you know, do they want to
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.200]   start looking right at one year out? Like, is there a sweet spot that you've seen of when someone
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.400]   should start actually looking for a trip they're planning? If they know long enough in advance that
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:56.480]   they could search any time? I think if you know, you should just go ahead and book. If you know
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.320]   that you're traveling someplace a year from now, look and book right now. You can always cancel it.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.920]   You can always change it. Award tickets are super flexible. There's frequently not even a penalty.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.800]   It depends on the program, of course, but it's so easy to change or cancel them. And you're not
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:22.320]   going to necessarily find something better. It used to be that within 10 days of departure,
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.800]   we'd see a lot more award space. Again, the goal is for seats to not go out empty. But with
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   COVID and the trying to think of a delicate way to say this, the social commitment to not having
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:46.960]   non-vaccine precautions, the reality of that is flight attendants and pilots are getting sick
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.240]   and they're not at work. And so if you are managing operations for an airline,
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:58.080]   you used to comfortably be able to say, okay, 10 days out, this is probably what our flight loads
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.920]   are going to look like. These are the seats that are going to have occupants. And then we feel
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.040]   good about it. And inventory management could say, great, we're going to release these seats
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.280]   into inventory. We'll let partners book them. Maybe we'll have a last minute sale. You know,
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.560]   there was some degrees of confidence. Now we're seeing that inventory get held until sometimes
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:20.880]   two hours before departure. Because on any given day, if you have one flight get canceled between
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.200]   San Francisco and Minneapolis, you now have 150 passengers that you have to do something with.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.240]   So if you don't have a crew, you have to accommodate those passengers. And so we're
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.640]   just not seeing the near-term inventory dumps that we used to see. That could get better.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.880]   So if you're booking a year out, you might get lucky. And within 10 days or 3 days,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:46.960]   you might see a better itinerary, you might see a non-stop, you might see a nicer product,
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.240]   and you can change to that. But in the current environment, if you see something, I would book it.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:58.160]   What about flexibility with where you go? This is a question that I know you've gotten and I've
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:03.120]   gotten a lot. It's like, I just want to take a trip that lets me get a great use of my miles
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:10.560]   and go somewhere in Asia next year. And I know from using basically any search tool on the
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.440]   internet, you can't go and say... I guess Google Flights is probably the closest, but it certainly
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.560]   doesn't have any miles and points component. But just to be like... It's nice to be able to say,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.880]   "Okay, from San Francisco in July or next year, where could I go that's cheap?"
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.840]   Is there a points and miles equivalent? Or what do you tell people that have a little bit more
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:35.760]   flexibility, but don't want to run 1000 searches? So if you're in California, and you want to go to
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:42.320]   Sydney, obviously, there's the direct flights that are going to be expensive on Qantas,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.960]   or American, or Delta, or United now has nice seats going to Australia. But you could also
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:56.720]   route via the Middle East. And you could do something like from California into Doha and
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:04.640]   fly Qatar's Qsuites, and then go first class from Doha to Sydney. And you can't really book that with
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:11.840]   money, because it's not a legal routing when using money. Qatar might sell it to you as part of a
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   round trip, but then there's different partners and things like that. But if you call Advantage,
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.560]   and you say, "Okay, I need to book two awards, but I want them on one ticket."
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.640]   They can book that for you. And it's business class and Qsuites on the long haul. So you get
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.400]   that nice flat bed. If you're traveling with a family, there's a suite that can basically be
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.960]   for four. It's a lovely experience. You can go to the museum and enjoy Doha, and then go on to
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   Sydney, and it's like 100,000 miles. And that's a great value. It's a really extended trip. It's a
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.800]   fun routing that you wouldn't necessarily do. And it's frequently fewer points than doing like an
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.600]   LA-Sydney direct, because carriers charge a premium for that in both miles and money,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.240]   because they know that's what people want to do. So you can be flexible with routing. And sometimes,
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.360]   points and miles lets you do that. What about just destinations? If someone said,
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.800]   "I want to go to Asia, or I want to go to Europe. I'm not sure where I want to go."
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.840]   Is there an argument to be made of just searching the major hubs to try to find something there
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.800]   first to see where it might be easiest to get to?
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.000]   Yeah. No, I think that's a perfect example. I, in general, think that it makes sense. It
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.440]   still makes sense to search hub to hub, and just to get a concept of things.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:27.040]   Let's talk about Europe, because Asia is very complicated with COVID still,
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.880]   but we can go back to Asia. The thing that I think we don't think about, because travel within the US
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:39.280]   is really unpleasant. Travel within Europe isn't necessarily unpleasant, and there are a lot of
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.640]   low-cost carriers. There's a lot of trains. There's a lot of ways to get around. So if you really want
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:51.280]   to go to Amalfi, you don't need to look at tickets to Naples. You can look at tickets to Munich,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.560]   and then there's a bajillion ways per day to get from Munich to Naples that you can't use points
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:05.600]   for, but it might be like a $45 ticket. So I think looking at a major hub in Europe as a starting
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.040]   point that you wouldn't mind spending a night in if you needed to, or a day, is a great place to
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:18.960]   get started with that. For people starting in the US, I think it's important to recognize that the
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:26.080]   closer you get to the ocean you're going to cross, the more flight options you will have.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.680]   So if you're in Miami and you're trying to go to Tokyo, I mean, good luck. You're not going to
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:39.040]   find seats. I think there is a Korean Air flight, or there used to be, from Miami to Seoul, which
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.520]   would have been a good option. But realistically, you're connecting in California, or at least in
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   Chicago, or possibly in Texas. And the same thing goes the other direction. If you're in California
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:54.400]   and you want to go to Europe, you could luck out and get a nonstop flight in business class
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:01.440]   at a good price point at the saver level. Or you might need to pay a few more points to have
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.120]   expanded availability, and you could plan for that. Or you might need to make a connection.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.200]   And that's where it gets into that trade-off of like, "Okay, if you're flexible, and totally
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:16.240]   flexible, you still benefit from determining what is most important to you. Is it the in-flight
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:24.400]   experience? Is it the travel time? Is it where you connect?" Because overnighting in Frankfurt is not
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.800]   as fun as overnighting in Munich. I don't know. Everybody has their own things of what matters
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.520]   to them, and the airports that they like to transit through and not. And I think if you consider all
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:38.400]   of that as part of your flexibility, it makes it a little bit easier to narrow down your travel
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.000]   plans and your flight options. And one thing we talked about before we got started was the
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.120]   flexibility of dates. People are like, "Oh, I want to go next year." One thing you pointed out that
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.680]   I was like, "Okay, well, are you really that flexible?" I was thinking about it for myself.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.400]   I was like, "Well, I might be flexible to go somewhere next year. But maybe I actually really
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:06.080]   only want to go on Saturday to Saturday or something so that we're not taking more than
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.200]   one week off of work or school or something." It's like, "Well, now you just narrowed 365 days down
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.560]   to 100." And you pointed out, "What about weather?" There are places...
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.280]   Right. There are places that are super muggy in the summer. And I love Japan as an example,
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.040]   because everyone is like, "Oh, I'll go anytime." But you don't actually want to be in Tokyo in
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:32.160]   July. It's very hot. They turn the escalators off. You could still go and have a great experience,
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:38.080]   but it wouldn't be my preferred time. What are the local holidays when you're going? If you're like,
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.440]   "Oh, okay. I'm going to try and time it for cherry blossom season." But do you want to
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   be there during golden week? Pros and cons to that. That should be a conscious decision.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.680]   There's also a bit of just the human psychology of it where we all have this fear of missing out.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:59.760]   And in decade plus of doing this, I think every single time... And I could check with my colleagues,
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.200]   but I'm pretty confident saying every time that we've had someone say, "I'm totally flexible."
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.280]   If I give you an itinerary, your natural instinct is going to be like, "Okay, but what about this
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.720]   instead? What about this alternative?" So you aren't actually totally flexible. You do have
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.760]   opinions. You do have priorities and things that you want to consider. So when you're booking for
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.520]   yourself, I think just going through that triage list and thinking about what are school schedules?
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.120]   What am I willing to accommodate? Do I want to have a night in a cool city on the way to my
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.720]   destination? Or do I want to just have a shorter layover and just plug through? Am I checking bags?
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:43.280]   If so, am I concerned about if my bags get lost? One of my colleagues, this is a great example,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.920]   their daughter and her husband were doing this hiking backpacking trip in rural Scotland last
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:57.120]   summer. And they did almost everything right in their planning, except they didn't plan enough
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:04.080]   time in Edinburgh at the start of the trip for in case things go wrong. And so when inevitably with
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.360]   the Heathrow baggage meltdown of last summer, their bag was delayed. They're like, "We're in
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.200]   Edinburgh and we have nothing. We don't have... We have just the essentials that we need in our
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:19.040]   carry-on, but we obviously didn't carry on our tent." So you need to think about those things
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.200]   and think about that too. With the type of trip that you're taking, that may matter or it may not
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.600]   be an impact at all. If you're planning on spending a week in Paris with your kids, having a lost
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   checked bag is not a big deal. You're in Paris, you just go to care for them, buy whatever you
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   need to buy and get it reimbursed through your credit cards, trip delay and coverage and move
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.160]   on with your life. Yeah. I think the other thing I've just been thinking about is, okay, even if I
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:50.320]   was like Japan flexible next year, there's probably an ideal month or an ideal period of time. And I
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.040]   don't know if you have any stats on this, but I imagine if you're like, "I want to go to almost
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.920]   anywhere," and you're flexible within a month, you're probably pretty likely to find something
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.600]   that I don't even know if you need a year's worth of flexibility.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.840]   No, no one needs a year's worth of flexibility is my general sentiment there.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:17.360]   Other than that year's worth of flexibility helps you rule times out. So I personally have done it
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.000]   a couple of times and I will probably in future avoid traveling to Asia during Lunar New Year.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.560]   It's a really fun experience in ways if you haven't done it, but I think for most people,
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.200]   if you're not actively setting out to do that, it's just frustrating. It's too crowded. All the
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.120]   places you want to go, everyone else also wants to go. And a lot of things are closed.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:47.360]   In Vietnam, they don't refill the ATMs during the holiday. So there's just one very specific
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:53.440]   difficulty for traveling during that time period. So there's things like that, that you can rule out.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.800]   But in general, I would say there's always a word space. And I don't want to say that that means
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.360]   there's always good award space, or there's always this thing that you saw on Instagram
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.200]   that you're going to be able to book, but there's always something. And
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:14.720]   finding something that is good for you has a lot of nuance.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.560]   Are there a few kind of either routes or destinations that if someone's truly like,
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.120]   "I just want to go on an amazing trip with my points" that you see more frequently than not
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.080]   popping up with better availability that could inspire someone and save them some points?
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:36.880]   I would generally say, if you're going further, you're going to have better availability.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:44.000]   Like domestically, North America, even South America, flights are so full that there are just
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.800]   not the point bargains that people might want. And so I do think that if you're looking for some
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.360]   kind of like aspirational fun trip, it makes more sense to go further afield. You also have the
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.640]   benefit of when you're going further of getting those international products that are much nicer.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:08.160]   Qatar has their Qsuites product and availability is pretty good. Not necessarily from all cities.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.080]   Like it's not great from LA right now because it's very popular, but they also have it to Seattle.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.560]   So if you're willing to do like that short hop up and then connect, and then that opens up all
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:23.040]   of Africa and the Middle East and Southeast Asia to some really phenomenal options.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.840]   I think if you're doing that, I also like to look at places where
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:33.200]   hotels are reasonable. A lot of people have like the pinnacle of their trip has been like,
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.920]   "I'm going to use my points. I'm going to fly business class or first class. I'm going to
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.720]   go to the Maldives." And that's great. I personally don't love the Maldives,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:46.400]   which I know is sacrilegious, but it's just a difference in what I'm looking for in travel
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.840]   at this point in my life. But I think that there's things like that, that you can look at, like,
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.760]   "Okay, well, I'm going to go and then I'm going to go and then I'm going to go back."
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.720]   I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.400]   And I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.360]   And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.160]   I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.720]   And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.600]   And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.160]   And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.320]   And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.560]   And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.

[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   And I think that's a really good point.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   And I think that's a really good point.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   Okay, that's fun. That's sort of two different questions.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   Why do airlines make it so hard?
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   I don't think airlines make it intentionally difficult to use their points.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.640]   It depends on the program.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   We have a lot of loyalty program managers
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.640]   that have been playing on easy mode recently.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   We're about to see this in a lot of aspects of the economy.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.640]   But when we had the last recession,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   loyalty programs had to get really innovative.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   And they had to get really creative.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   And ultimately, the job of a loyalty program
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   is to fill seats on planes or fill hotel rooms.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   It's to avoid perishable inventory.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   That's why you have a loyalty program.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   And we saw 15 years ago,
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.640]   really a lot of creative promotions
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   and really interesting engagement
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   and really honing in on who the customer was
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   and how to leverage their interests and emotions
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   in order to get seats filled on planes.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   That hasn't been a challenge recently.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   I mean, the past couple of years notwithstanding,
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   but the latter half of this decade,
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.640]   everybody's on easy mode.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   We saw a lot of loyalty programs go to,
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   we're basically running a coupon program.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   It's buy nine, get one free, just like at your local coffee shop.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   And that's as innovative as they were getting
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   because people had a lot of money to spend on flights.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   And so it wasn't as much of a priority.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   So I don't know that programs don't want you to use your points.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   They do because they want you to be engaged with the program.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   They want you to be a repeat customer.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   They want you to have that satisfaction of redeeming your points
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   because then you're going to commit to earning more points.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   That's what loyalty is.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   All those things are important.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   But they are burdened by using computer systems
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.640]   from like the Apollo era in some cases,
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   where literally they're using DOS-based systems still in some cases.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   I think one of the most public examples of this,
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   and I think it's to the credit of the program that they shared this,
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   was AeroPlan with their AeroPlan 2020 project,
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   which they started in 2016,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   knowing that they were going to buy back their loyalty program.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   They were going to modernize their technology
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   and move off of Resy 2, which was their old reservation system,
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.640]   which Resy 2, because it came about in like the 1980s,
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   rather than what they had before.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   So moving from that technology that's literally older than us
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   into something more modern took them five and a half years.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.640]   So it's these huge technical lifts.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   And that's the case with a lot of this.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   There are still airlines where they are taking their award inventory,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   and it's a CSV file that they're uploading from time to time
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.640]   into their other inventory system.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.640]   Their revenue management systems aren't tied with their airline inventory systems.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   And if the person who's in charge of uploading the CSV isn't there that week,
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   then award inventory doesn't get added that week.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   You have to wait until the next week.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   Fortunately, that's rare.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   But when you talk about why is this so hard, that's why it's so hard.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   It's they don't have super robust computer systems.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.640]   -And how are you guys--
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   I remember a handful of companies trying to make this easy.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   There were plenty of people that were like,
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.640]   "We're going to help you find the award flights."
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   How did you guys end up making it work?
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   Was it relationships with airlines?
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   Was it just software?
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   How is that possible?
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   -Ultimately, I think what it is--
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   without getting into like secret sauce and things like that.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   Of course, we can talk about some of that.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.640]   But ultimately, I think it's the experience and the knowledge.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   Other people have tried this, but most of the time,
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.640]   it's been people who are parachuting into the space.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.640]   And they're looking at it and being like, "Oh, here's an opportunity.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   I love opportunities. I'm going to do this."
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.640]   But they don't have the decades of really deep knowledge
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   of airline inventory systems,
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   and especially as they relate to loyalty management.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   And that's not repeatable.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   No one else has that.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   It's just a handful of people who would have had it to begin with,
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.640]   and we're all working on point me.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   So I think that's the thing.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.640]   It is not an exaggeration when I say that even people who work at airlines
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   don't understand how their systems work in many cases,
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   as far as it relates to their business rules or their routing logic
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.640]   or their partner relationships.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   They don't know, but we know.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   And so we were able to take that knowledge
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:43.640]   and build out all of those data relationships and those ontologies
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   and those different structures that allow you to then create
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.640]   the business logic and the tool itself.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   But you have to have all that knowledge to give it to the software.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   You can't just...
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   - Basically, you've built this tool where I can go in and say,
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:04.640]   "I want to go from destination A to destination B on these dates
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   in business or economy with this many people."
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:12.640]   And you'll go out and run the 30 browser tab search on your side
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   and come back in a couple of minutes with,
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   "Here's exactly what's available across all the airlines."
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.640]   And because you've gone in and said,
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   "I have Chase points or I have Amex points or Capital One points,
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   here's the cheapest way to book it."
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   And I'm pretty sure it's also like,
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   "And here are the instructions on how to transfer them and book it."
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.640]   - Yeah, step-by-step, here's how I would book it myself, for sure.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   And I think the thing that is worth noting,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.640]   maybe goes into what you were talking about,
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.640]   how airlines make this difficult for themselves,
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   not just for us, but for themselves.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.640]   We're not just going out and doing 30 searches.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.640]   I mean, we're pulling inventory from like 35 different places
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   at this point in time,
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.640]   and we're continuing to refine our data sources.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:56.640]   We're also applying all of the routing rules and the logic.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   So things that airline websites themselves don't always show,
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   but we know to work.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   And then there's things that like,
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   we know that the airline website doesn't show it either,
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   and we're still trying to figure out
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   how we best present it without causing frustration.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   I can give a real-time example.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   Delta is partners with China Airlines,
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   which is a Taipei-based airline.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.640]   And I don't know if it's political reasons or technical reasons,
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:26.640]   but you can't find routings on delta.com
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   connecting through Taipei on China Airlines very easily.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   It requires a lot of manipulation of the website
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   in a way that no other airport code requires.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   And so ultimately,
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   those things generally have to get booked over the phone
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.640]   if they're bookable at all, but we know that they're there.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   And so that's something that Point Me can do,
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   is we can look at, okay, well, we know the slide is here.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   We can combine this,
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   and we can tell you what the price should be.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   And then it's, yeah,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   here's the instructions because you're going to have to call,
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   and this is the magic word that you're going to have to say
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.640]   to the airline agent in order for them
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   to be able to find the inventory.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   And so sometimes we go through that and we say,
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.640]   we decide that, okay, this is actually too complicated.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.640]   Let's pause this for now.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   Let's maybe not show this result.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   So we do a lot of that triangulation,
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   a lot of that verification.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   If we see something that's available on AeroPlan's website
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   and on United's website,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   but it's not available through a third Star Alliance carrier,
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   we go through this whole check process of,
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.640]   is this space actually available to Star Alliance?
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   Is it Phantom Space?
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.640]   Which is when one of these airline websites
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   is just making things up,
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.640]   and they display a flight that's not bookable.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   So we try and go through and filter that as well
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   and apply our knowledge
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   so that people aren't getting frustrated
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.640]   by trying to book things that aren't there.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.640]   - The reason I reached out to you originally to say,
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   hey, is there any way we can get a deal for listeners,
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   because I was like, this is the tool I wanna recommend.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   And so anyone that does the kind of standard
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   monthly membership can get the first month for a dollar
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   with the code AllTheHacks.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.640]   And that's what I tell people to do.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.640]   And I would tell them to do it
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   if you didn't have a discount code.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   It's nicer for them to get one.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   - We did wanna do that and just make it easy
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   for people who have points,
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   because everyone has points
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   and no one really knows how to use them.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.640]   And I can teach you how to do it by hand.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   We have 30,000 blog posts on one mile at a time
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.640]   if you want to do this by hand.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.640]   I don't know who has time to read 30,000 blog posts though,
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.640]   but if you want to, there's an option available to you.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   You don't have to pay anything to learn how to do this,
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   but there is a market for people who don't want to do that.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   They don't wanna open 30 or 60 browser tabs.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   They just wanna see what their options are,
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   get a sense of what the prices are
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   so that they can do their goal posting
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   as they're earning their points.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   And just to be like, okay, wow, great to know
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.640]   that I can do San Francisco, Paris
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   with flying blue on the nonstop.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   Didn't realize the fuel surcharges
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   were gonna be $450 a person.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   I'm gonna think about that, you know,
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   and be informed and then be able to make a decision
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.640]   and discuss and contemplate their travel plans.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   Like that's really what we wanted for Point Me
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   was to just help people not feel like the space
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   was completely opaque and impenetrable
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   that they could be informed and make travel choices.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.640]   - Advice I often give people is,
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   look, if you wanna do a quick search,
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.640]   pull up like the main three domestic carriers
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   or maybe a partner that has better search.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   So I always say like, pull up United,
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   pull up Air France, pull up British Airways
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   and you could do three searches.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   That's not gonna get you a comprehensive view.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   Like by all means, I've done that three airline search
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   and then I've gone to Point Me
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   and I've gotten results that I didn't find.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   But sometimes it's like, you know,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   you find exactly what you're looking for on search one
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   and you don't need the other 59 browser tabs.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.640]   - Well, and that is why I like to say like,
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   start with, you know, the Wikipedia page
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.640]   of the airport you wanna go to
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   because it gives you some bounds
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.640]   for your browser tab experience, right?
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   And you could look and be like,
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.640]   okay, so I'm looking at this list.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.640]   There's not a single Star Alliance carrier.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.640]   I mean, granted, you also have to open the tab
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   for Star Alliance carriers.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   So you're two tabs, but you know,
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   there's not a single Star Alliance carrier that flies here.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.640]   So maybe there's not a benefit of even opening United
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.640]   or Aeroplan, but like, oh,
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   there's three different one world carriers that fly here.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.640]   So I can just use, you know, the Alaska tool
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.640]   or the American tool or the Qantas tool
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.640]   or the British Airways tool
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   or whichever one I'm most familiar with
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   and most comfortable using.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   And I can look at space there.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   - I can't speak to this product because I haven't used it,
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.640]   but someone emailed me from a company called Flights From,
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   and I pulled up the product and I just looked at it.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   You can go in and say all nonstop flights from Paris
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   filter by Star Alliance.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   So, and it actually shows you all the flights there,
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   you know, days of the week, what airlines they are.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   You know, I'm not getting paid to promote this product,
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   but you know,
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.640]   for someone who wants something more visual than Wikipedia,
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.640]   which by the way, Wikipedia was also my path.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   I'm always like, wiki, CDG, go look and look at the airline.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   I feel like sometimes you get like, oh, this is seasonal.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.640]   It's not going to start till next November.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   Whereas if you just search a flight connection.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.640]   - Right, this seasonal thing is so helpful
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.640]   because I always get people who are like, oh my gosh,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.640]   you know, I want to fly nonstop to Nice.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   It's like, okay, there is one fricking flight
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.640]   from the US to Nice and it's seasonal.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   And they're like, oh, but my friend just took it.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.640]   Yes, in the season, right?
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   You were not, it's November, it is not the season.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.640]   - But I did play around on this site for a little bit.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   And I was like, oh, this is actually like,
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   this is a tool I would like.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   I can look at a routing map and, you know,
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.640]   filter for where does it go, so.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.640]   - Yeah, I'm looking at it now.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.640]   I think that's really fun.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.640]   The one thing that I would caution with looking at this,
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.640]   'cause you know I have to have a caution,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   is that it looks like it includes
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   a lot of low cost carriers,
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.640]   which is phenomenal for thinking about
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   how you can be flexible,
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:50.640]   but is not going to be good for using your points.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.640]   'Cause you generally can't use your points
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   on those low cost carriers.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.640]   - My hack there was I went in
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.640]   and I just checked like Star Alliance.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   - Yeah, so the same thing that you can do
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   on Google Flights then, where you can just be like,
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   just show me Star Alliance or just show me One World.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   - Yeah, I guess Google Flights just does all this also.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   I don't know why.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   I don't know why I was looking for a new tool.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   It's just sometimes I'm like,
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.640]   what airlines fly here and Google Flights.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:11.640]   - Well, because I mean,
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.640]   I actually do think that the low cost carrier feature
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:16.640]   is super helpful 'cause you often don't see those
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.640]   and they matter.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   You know, we used to live in Sicily
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   and like, yes, there were a couple of Alitalia flights,
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.640]   but mostly it was going to be EasyJet or Ryanair
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   or Air Malta or things that you couldn't use points on
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   and you weren't going to find searching,
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   you know, other consolidators
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   unless you knew to look for them.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:43.640]   So I think knowing where to look is hugely valuable.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.640]   - Are there any other tools in the space online
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   that you use or recommend people check out
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   when they're trying to think about award travel?
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.640]   - I think it depends on what you wanna do.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.640]   And this is, I don't want it to be a plug,
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.640]   but this gets into why we built Point Me
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.640]   because there are things like, I use ExpertFlyer every day,
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   but more for schedules and upgrade space potentially
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   and things like that.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   You can use it for award inventory, but ExpertFlyer,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   like if you know that A space is first class in Alaska
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   and W is economy, you can pull up ExpertFlyer,
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   you can search for it that way,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.640]   but it requires a lot of knowledge
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.640]   to be able to use it effectively
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   and requires you to know the routing rules.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   You know, like you can find you space,
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.640]   but it doesn't tell you the combined ability.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   So if you are getting deeper in the rabbit hole
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   and you're really interested in those kinds of things,
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   I think you get to a point
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   where ExpertFlyer is indispensable
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.640]   for sort of cobbling those things together
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640]   and being like, oh my gosh,
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   I should actually book premium economy
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   on Virgin Atlantic on this route.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.640]   And then I should upgrade
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.640]   because then I'll get my extra MQMs for Delta.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   When you get into that level,
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.640]   you definitely need some of those more technical tools
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.640]   that aren't necessarily as user friendly,
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.640]   but do have really great information.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   - Yeah, I will point one thing out
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.640]   that you just brushed over,
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   which is just because you find award availability
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640]   between two cities
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.640]   doesn't mean that you can always combine it.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.640]   So I've had times where it's like,
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   oh, I can go from San Francisco to Paris
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.640]   and Paris to, I don't know, let's say Athens.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640]   And I like looked at each individual leg
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   happens to have an award flight that's reasonably priced,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.640]   but when combining them, it doesn't always work.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.640]   So I know you guys do that in your search,
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   but I would just caution people sometimes.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640]   And I'm curious what you think about this.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   Sometimes I'm like, okay, I wanna get to Europe.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.640]   So let's not look at the ultimate destination.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   Let's just look at like the transatlantic flights.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.640]   And that's like how I sometimes narrow it down.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   I'm like, look, I'm not gonna take two stops.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.640]   So like, I wanna get from San Francisco to Athens.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640]   If you're willing to say,
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.640]   I'm only gonna change planes once
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.640]   and ideally it's not, you know,
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.640]   a six hour flight to the East Coast,
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.640]   you can kind of narrow it down to like,
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.640]   maybe there's only seven routings you could take
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.640]   or 10 routings.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   You could just kind of systematically
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.640]   check those seven to 10,
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   but just make sure that you check them
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.640]   all together by the end.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   Otherwise you might end up finding out
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   that it doesn't actually work.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   - Right, and the altogether at the end
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   will also matter based on what program
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   you're booking through.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   That phenomenon you're describing
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.640]   is referred to as married segment itineraries,
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.640]   where there are many cases where,
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   let's say it's Lufthansa,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.640]   'cause they do this a lot,
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.640]   where they'll say, sure, you know,
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.640]   if you are coming from San Francisco,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   of course we'll make sure that there's space
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.640]   all the way through to Athens for you,
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.640]   or vice versa.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.640]   And they'll say, you know,
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   this isn't necessarily combinable on our ward
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   because, you know,
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.640]   we don't need to make inventory available
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   on the Frankfurt-Athens route.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.640]   It's going to sell out anyways.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   So there's a lot of that,
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.640]   and it can depend because some,
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   even within an alliance,
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.640]   some partners have better access
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   to those married segment itineraries,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   or they are willing to pay
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640]   a little bit more to their partner
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.640]   to have access to that space.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.640]   Or sometimes it's, especially in the US,
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.640]   this segment is only available
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.640]   to members of our loyalty program.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.640]   So Delta or United or American
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   might even be able to give you
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   a great discount on that flight
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.640]   from San Francisco to Salt Lake,
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   but they're not going to make it available
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   to their alliance partners.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.640]   So, you know,
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640]   you wouldn't be able to combine it
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   if you then saw space on Flying Blue.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   - But if someone's kind of thinking,
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.640]   okay, I want to take a trip,
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.640]   is there an easy way to just get a good sense
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   of like how much it might cost?
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   You know, it used to be, you know,
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   years ago, there's just an award chart.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   It's like, okay,
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.640]   I could go pull up the award chart
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.640]   for a few airlines and it's like,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.640]   you know, I remember United,
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   it was like every domestic flight
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.640]   was 25,000 points in coach
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.640]   and 50,000 points in business round trip.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.640]   And it was just so simple.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.640]   It's like, you want to go to Europe?
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   This is the cost.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.640]   Maybe some airlines, you know,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.640]   I think some airlines still have that,
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   but for the most part,
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   it seems like everything is a mixed bag.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.640]   How could someone just kind of get a sense
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.640]   of what might it cost a family of four
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   to go to Europe without necessarily
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   having to go through all the searching?
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.640]   So many programs still have award charts.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.640]   You know, like American Advantage
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.640]   still has an award chart for their partners.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.640]   And I think that's actually
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.640]   probably a good place to look.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   They still publish it.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.640]   And a lot of things are in that range.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   You know, so if you're like,
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   I have no idea, ballpark,
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   what I should be spending,
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   you know, that gives you a sense.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.640]   It gives you a starting place.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   And Delta or United or Aeroplan
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640]   may charge more or less,
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   but at least you have the right number
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.640]   of significant figures.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.640]   You know, for the most part.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   The flip side of not everybody
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.640]   having award charts is that
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.640]   with the dynamic pricing,
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.640]   sometimes you can see really low prices
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.640]   that would never have made it
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   onto an award chart
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.640]   just based off of inventory capacity.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   I mentioned earlier,
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   Virgin Atlantic will have
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.640]   just bargain flights
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   from New York to London,
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   you know, 10,000 miles in economy.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   And if you stack that
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   with a transfer bonus,
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.640]   you know, and where you're getting
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   a 30% bonus when you transfer
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   your chase points to Virgin Atlantic,
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640]   it's just a steal, right?
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   That would never show up
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   on an award chart.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.640]   It's not a consistent price necessarily,
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.640]   but it happens often enough that,
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   you know, I can speak to it
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   because it's not like a one-off, right?
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640]   It happens with some consistency
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.640]   when they have extra space on a plane.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.640]   So the dynamic inventory is hard, right?
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.640]   Because we all like to know
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.640]   how much things are going to cost
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.640]   and be able to work towards them.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.640]   I think that's such a key component
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   of loyalty programs.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.640]   But the little bit of the crumb
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.640]   that you're getting there, at least,
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.640]   is that there are sometimes
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.640]   some really great values
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.640]   on the other side,
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.640]   especially domestically, I think,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.640]   where you get some prices
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.640]   that you wouldn't have anticipated.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.640]   When people listen, they're like,
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   "Okay, I now get it.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.640]   "I know how...
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   "I feel confident about how
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.640]   "I could start to plan this trip
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.640]   "and book this and find availability.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.640]   "But now I got to go get
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.640]   "those 300,000 points."
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.640]   I think we've talked plenty about,
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.640]   "Okay, well, you can get the card
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   "that optimizes where you spend your money.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.640]   "You can get some sign-up bonuses
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   "and keep on top of what they are."
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   I try to share that.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.640]   Any other kind of, maybe,
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.640]   second-level hacks or tips or tactics
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   that you like to share with people
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.640]   who are trying to get to that mileage goal
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.640]   so they can take the trip?
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.640]   Yeah, that's really a fun question.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.640]   I think, in general,
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.640]   I like to encourage people
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.640]   to be opportunistic.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.640]   If there is a great sign-up bonus,
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.640]   to take advantage of it.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.640]   I'm also at a place
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.640]   where I recognize that people
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.640]   who are doing this also have other jobs.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   Right? Full-time jobs.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.640]   So you don't necessarily
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.640]   want to be in a situation
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.640]   where you have so many cards
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.640]   and they're hard to manage
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.640]   and things like that.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.640]   But I think it's important to think about it.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   If you're planning an extended family trip,
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.640]   maybe you have that conversation
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.640]   with the extended family
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   and say, "Hey, this is a trip
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.640]   "we want to take.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   "It's going to be this many points.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640]   "In our household,
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.640]   "we're going to get that
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   "because we're both going
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640]   "to get this card.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.640]   "That might be an option for you.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   "You don't want to be in charge
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640]   "of your family's finances overall.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.640]   "It's a bad, bad life choice."
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   But to think about that
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   and to be sure
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   that as you are getting credit cards,
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   that your points
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640]   are ultimately combinable.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   I think this is especially important
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640]   if you have a family
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   or if you're more than one person
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   in general,
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   is, okay, it doesn't help you
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.640]   to have 50,000 points here
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   and 60,000 points here
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640]   and 80,000 points here
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   and 70,000 points here.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.640]   You may find yourself
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   in a situation
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   where you have half a million points
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   and you don't have enough points
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   for a single round-trip
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   international ticket
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   because they're not combinable.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.640]   So that's, I think,
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   the second level thing
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   is don't just get
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.640]   the Chase Sapphire Preferred
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   because it has a big sign-up bonus.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]   Like, that's great.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   Do that.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   But then when you go
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   to get your next card,
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   look at, okay,
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   well, where could these points move to?
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   I want to make sure
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   that my next card,
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   I can also move those points
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   to the same places
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   or it bolsters
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.640]   one of those balances there.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.640]   And just make sure you have
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.640]   a couple hundred thousand points
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.640]   in a program
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.640]   or able to get to a program
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640]   before you move on
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   to the next thing.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   My advice has been,
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.640]   you know, you can now,
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.640]   for most airlines,
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   book one-way awards.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640]   So instead of,
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   I always say,
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   instead of trying to book like,
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   oh, we're two people
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   and we have enough points
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640]   in two programs,
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.640]   book the one-ways together,
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.640]   both be on the same itinerary
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.640]   with one program
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   and then the return
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   with the other program
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   instead of trying to book
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   each person separately.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   Especially if you have
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   one person who's not as confident
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   of a traveler,
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.640]   you know,
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.640]   or you have that,
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.640]   you know, the extended family members.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.640]   I always talk about like,
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.640]   when we're traveling with our moms,
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.640]   it's totally different
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.640]   than when we're traveling
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   just with each other.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640]   And I think that that's key,
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.640]   like staying on the same itinerary.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.640]   And again, it's just,
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.640]   are you getting points
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.640]   in a program?
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   So maybe it's more thinking of like,
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640]   am I getting points
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.640]   in an account, right?
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   Because if you have,
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   if you have 50,000 points
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.640]   in United Mileage Plus
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.640]   and your partner has 50,000 points
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.640]   in United Mileage Plus,
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.640]   you still,
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.640]   neither together
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.640]   nor separately,
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   have enough points
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   to do what you want to do.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   You know,
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   if you have 100,000 points
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640]   in one account,
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640]   you have more options.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   Alyssa actually reminded me,
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   I know Capital One,
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.640]   you can share points with anyone.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   So if you have Capital One points,
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.640]   you can.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.640]   With Chase,
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   I think it's within your household.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   So if you're both accumulating Chase,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640]   you can share within your household.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.640]   Amex,
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   most of the actual airlines though,
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   make it incredibly difficult
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   and costly to share points.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.640]   So another bump
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.640]   to the transferable points game
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.640]   is that it is very hard to,
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   like if you have American points
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   and someone else has American points,
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   you combining them for a trip,
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   a few of the international carriers
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   have programs for this,
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   but it's very hard.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   Yeah, you should combine,
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640]   combine them
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   before they get to the airline.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   The nice thing though,
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.640]   is that for the most part,
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   all the airlines will let you
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   book tickets for someone else.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.640]   And we hear this all the time
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   because we have the grandparents
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.640]   who want to pay for a honeymoon
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.640]   and they're like,
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   "How do I get my Amex points
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   to my granddaughter?"
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.640]   It's like, "You don't.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   "We'll take your Amex points
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   "and we'll move them
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   "to maybe your Aeroplane account
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.640]   "and then we'll book the flights
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   "for her from your account."
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   You don't have to transfer them
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.640]   to other people and pay transfer fees.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   But if you do have,
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.640]   if you and your spouse both have,
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.640]   let's call it 50,000 Amex points
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   and you want to book an award
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.640]   that's 100,000,
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.640]   there's no good answer.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   You can't combine Amex points.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.640]   But my version of a hack,
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   which I think is still possible,
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   is that if you get
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   an authorized cardholder,
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.640]   if you add your spouse
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   as your authorized cardholder,
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.640]   then you can transfer points
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   from Amex to their accounts.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   - Correct, yeah.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   If it's an authorized user
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   that you can transfer them,
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   transfer them to the same account.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640]   - So you can't combine
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   the membership rewards balances,
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.640]   but if you're transferring to Delta,
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   you could transfer them both
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.640]   to the same Delta account
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   and book from there.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   - Right.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   I would say if you are going to do that
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   and you know you're going to do that,
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.640]   do...
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.640]   It gets tricky.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   There is a high potential
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   for the airline to put a fraud alert
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   on the account
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   if you're getting back-to-back transfers
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   from different accounts
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   in short succession.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.640]   They'll resolve it.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   It's not going to be actual fraud.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]   It's just going to be something
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.640]   that needs manual approval.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   So if you are in a situation
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   where it's like, "Oh my gosh,
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.640]   I know that I'm going to book this flight,"
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   or you find this diamond
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.640]   in the rough award space
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.640]   that you would never have been able to book
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   and you're like moving
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   all these points all around
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.640]   to temper expectations
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   because it might be 72 hours
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   before those points are cleared
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.640]   for you to book it
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.640]   in that specific example.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   I don't want to dissuade anyone
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.640]   from earning points,
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.640]   but it's good to know
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.640]   that there can be pitfalls.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.640]   - One important thing actually
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.640]   that came up with another listener
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   was there are a lot of mileage programs
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   where I think it's like
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   you can't transfer points in for 72 hours
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.640]   or there's some rules
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   about how long the account has to be open
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.640]   before you can book something.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.640]   So one suggestion I have
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   is if you have Chase
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.640]   and it doesn't cost you anything
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.640]   to go to the dozen or so Chase airline partners
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   and go open all of those mileage accounts now.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.640]   I don't know if you know exactly which ones,
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   but I know there are at least a few airlines
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640]   where it's much better
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.640]   to have had the account open
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.640]   than open it when you need it.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640]   - Yeah, I mean,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.640]   I would actually say
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   with almost any of them,
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   it's better.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.640]   And again, this is just security checks
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.640]   are all driven by algorithms.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   And it's obviously,
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   if I say it out loud,
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640]   it's obviously more suspicious
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   to have a brand new account
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   that was just opened
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   and now is receiving points
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   from non-flight activity
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.640]   from multiple sources in 90 minutes.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.640]   Like if you're a computer,
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.640]   you flag that too, right?
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   So you can just avoid
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.640]   some of those triggers
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.640]   by opening the accounts early on,
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   maybe make a purchase
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   through the airline shopping portal early on.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640]   I don't want the takeaway from this though
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   to be that like airlines
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   are super concerned about fraud
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.640]   and that you're going to run into problems
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.640]   when you're doing meet your points.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   This gets into like the edge cases of it.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.640]   Most people are not going to have these problems.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   - But there are some airlines
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.640]   where I think you can't actually do anything.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.640]   Even if they don't flag you for fraud,
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   they just have a rule.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   It's like you can't do anything for three days.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   Your account has to be open for a week.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   - Yeah, and there's others
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   where you can't search award space
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   unless you have a couple of points in the account.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.640]   And if you can't search award space,
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   that means you can't book award flights.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   So, but you don't necessarily need
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   to have the full number of points,
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   but if you have two points in there
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   or five points
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   because you bought something
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   through their shopping portal
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   and posted the points there,
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   then you can have full functionality.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   - And the other one is I've had some issues.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.640]   I can't remember exactly why,
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   but my name is long enough
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   that sometimes when I try to add an airline
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640]   to my Amex account,
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.640]   the transfer points out.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   It's like, ah, it didn't work.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   So I would also say you can go in
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   and link up your,
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   if you go and create an airline mileage account
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   for all these airlines that you can transfer to,
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   you can also go and link those accounts
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   to your Amex, Chase, Cap One kind of account as well.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   And the thing I'm ultimately trying
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.640]   to help everyone avoid is you don't want to go
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   and find a flight and be ready to book it.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   Then finally I found the availability.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640]   - Right.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   - But I didn't.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640]   - And now it all falls apart.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   - And now I need to wait three days
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   for my account to be active.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.640]   Or now my account was active,
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.640]   but now that I linked to Amex,
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   there's like some error
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.640]   and I have to get Amex
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   to help resolve the error before it works.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   - Right.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   - So I like to put all the pieces in place.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.640]   - That's actually maybe the next level of things
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.640]   is when you are applying for credit cards
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   to apply for them with the name
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   that is on your secure flight information.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.640]   And this might seem obvious to people,
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.640]   but like American Express
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.640]   will issue you a credit card as C. Hutchins,
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   but Flying Blue won't allow you
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.640]   to create a Flying Blue account with C. Hutchins.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   It needs to be Chris or Christopher
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.640]   or whatever is on your passport.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.640]   And so when you go to transfer the points,
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.640]   they won't match.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   And so Flying Blue will send the points back.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   So, and I think a lot of us with like shorter names
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.640]   or I have two middle names,
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   so I just never include them on anything
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.640]   because it's too complicated.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   But, you know, it's like,
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   oh, I'm just applying for this credit card
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640]   and I'm not thinking about using my full legal name
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   as it is on my passport.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.640]   So just to add something else to,
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   just something else to make it
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   a little bit more complicated for everybody.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   - Any other travel points, miles,
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   broad speaking, tactics, tricks, hacks to share
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.640]   before we wrap?
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   - I think the biggest thing to think about
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.640]   is that you can absolutely use your points.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   People get so overwhelmed.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.640]   They get so wrapped up in trying to optimize
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.640]   and find the very best example,
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.640]   or they see, you know, influencers who are doing things
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640]   and they think that there's only one way
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.640]   to redeem their points.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.640]   At the end of the day,
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:49.640]   the best use of your points
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.640]   is one that allows you to have an experience
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   that might have otherwise been out of reach.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   Whether that's a trip that was expensive
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.640]   or a trip that was difficult
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.640]   or a trip that was super aspirational and lovely
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   and to just not be afraid to go ahead and book it.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   Like, there's no, it's not a contest.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   It's not a race.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.640]   And there are tremendous ways to improve your life
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   through these experiences.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   Just go for it.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   If it's not perfect,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   then maybe the next one will be better.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.640]   And you learn so much going through that first process
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.640]   of booking an award flight
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   that you then apply to the second.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   But I find so many people are too intimidated
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.640]   to book the first one.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.640]   - Yep.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.640]   And hopefully I think people can leave this saying,
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   "Okay, I feel like I understand how the system works
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.640]   "so I can, you know, do some searching myself.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.640]   "I know of at least one tool that you guys have built
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.640]   "that will make this a lot easier."
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.640]   - The reason why we set a point up the way that we did
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   and why we're happy to, you know,
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   for certain audiences like yours
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   give a really significant discount to use it for a month
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.640]   is because we are pretty evangelical
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.640]   about using points as an option.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.640]   So for a dollar, you can spend a whole month clicking around
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   and just sort of seeing what the options are.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   And we have the instructions laid out for you
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.640]   step by step by step.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.640]   And I do truly think that for most people,
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.640]   if you just try, maybe even take a theoretical trip,
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.640]   one that you're not emotionally committed to yet,
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   but you've just thought about wanting to take
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   and go through the steps,
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   and maybe you're not actually transferring your points,
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.640]   but you're sitting there and thinking,
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.640]   "Okay, this is the point where I would go
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.640]   "to my credit card company and I would transfer the points.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   "And okay, I see now how I would book."
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.640]   And just play with it and build that confidence in doing it,
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   because it doesn't have to be overwhelming.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.640]   It's not, at the end of the day,
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.640]   well, there's a lot of information.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.640]   There's a lot that you could do.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.640]   There's a lot of ways that you could maximize
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   the heck out of it.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.640]   At the end of the day, it's not that much more difficult
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.640]   than other things that you successfully do
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   every week of your life, right?
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   You're just applying that skill set
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.640]   and those abilities to something different.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.640]   And you only are able to do new things
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   when you practice them.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   I do think we work really hard at Point Me
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   to give you all the tools that you need to be successful.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.640]   We're checking to make sure that it's actual flights
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   that you can actually book
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   with the points you actually have.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.640]   And we have step-by-step instructions,
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   including little videos of like,
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   "Here's where you go to click."
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   So ideally, anyone should be able to do this.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   And I laugh because we say this, but it's true.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   We've tested it with our moms,
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.640]   who are not the most tech-savvy group of ladies out there,
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   although we love them.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   So I do really hope that by using the self-serve tool there,
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   that for a very moderate price,
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.640]   you're equipped and you can book travel.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.640]   If you are somebody though,
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.640]   who has a lot of points and a lot of different accounts
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.640]   or with different family members,
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   or you're planning something that is complicated,
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   but you know specifically what you want to do,
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   it's just too complicated and it's too intimidating.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.640]   We do have a team of people that can book that for you.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   It's obviously much, much, much more expensive
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   than the self-serve tool,
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   but that is an option that's available as well.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.640]   - You've been to a bunch of countries, more than me,
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.640]   more than probably most people listening.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.640]   Are there a couple of places that you think
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.640]   might not be on someone's radar?
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.640]   Like you mentioned earlier,
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:01.640]   your new focus on travel isn't just the place everyone goes.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   Are there a couple of places that you'd say
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   people should check out and maybe
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.640]   something interesting they could do while they're there
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   that might make it an exciting destination?
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   - I do think that Malaysia is really underrated
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   for people who are looking for a trip to Asia.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.640]   Incredible food, really welcoming people,
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.640]   fantastic beaches on a lot of the islands.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.640]   I think that that's some place
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   that people should really consider.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.640]   And then I'm of course biased because I've lived in Sicily
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.640]   and people go to Italy,
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.640]   but they don't really go to Sicily to the same extent.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   And I think if you are an independent traveler
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.640]   or you're open to, again,
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   having to work for it a little bit,
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.640]   that there's some really incredible experiences there,
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.640]   some agriturismos that you can stay at
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   where you're getting just a much warmer experience
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.640]   than you'd find on a lot of mainland Italy.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   And some interesting history and archeology
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   and all those things too
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.640]   that not as much on the tourist trail.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.640]   - Tiffany, thank you so much for being here.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.640]   This is great. I appreciate it.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   - Of course. Thanks for having me.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.640]   I hope it was helpful and demystifying for people.
