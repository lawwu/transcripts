[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   A podcast listener named Scott in Abilene, Texas writes in to ask this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.540]   I've heard people use Jeremiah 19 verses 4-5 as a refutation of the absolute sovereignty
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.440]   of God over evil, particularly the line, 'Nor did it come into my mind.'"
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   "I fully believe and trust in God's supreme sovereignty, but I must admit that this took
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.200]   me back." How does such a text fit within the doctrine of the sovereignty of God? Can
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.000]   a sovereign God ever be surprised?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.240]   Wow. This takes me back 15 years, maybe 20, when I was in the thick of the battle over
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.680]   open theism. That's a pretty sophisticated argument from Jeremiah 19, and it might be
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.600]   helpful for me to sketch the battle lines here, because the force of that argument against
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.040]   the sovereignty of God won't be felt without some sense of what open theism is. So let
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.960]   me give you a little sketch. Open theism is a view, I think it's a wrong view, is a view
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.520]   that the future is open-ended even to God. That is, God does not know, not only doesn't
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.720]   control all details of the future, but he doesn't know them either, especially the acts
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:40.160]   of morally free agents like humans. This view is seen by its proponents as the only consistent
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   view of Arminian theology. Remember, historically, Arminianism has taught that God does not decisively
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.560]   control the future moral acts of people, like whether they believe on Jesus or not. People
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.920]   really do have ultimate self-determination. But God does, this is what Arminianism says,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   God does exhaustively know. Know. He doesn't control it, but he knows the future moral
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.560]   acts of people. Now open theism says that can't be, because if God is infallible and
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.480]   knows what we are going to choose before we choose it, then the choice must happen or
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.000]   God would make a mistake. And so God's foreknowledge of an act makes the act certain or necessary.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.200]   And theism solves that problem by saying God doesn't know the future of our morally
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   responsible acts. And they find arguments, besides that philosophical one, in the Bible
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.840]   in places like Jeremiah 19, 4, and 5. So let me tell you how I, back in those days, responded
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.600]   to those arguments. Here's what the text says. "The people of Israel have forsaken
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.640]   me and have filled this place with blood, the blood of innocence, that is, they have
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.600]   sacrificed children to false gods, and have built high places to Baal to burn their sons
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:21.560]   in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or declare, nor did it come
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.640]   into my mind." Okay, now that's the text. And what's been stumbled over is, "It
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.680]   didn't come into my mind." What does that mean? The argument of open theism is that
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.280]   God did not see it coming, or as the questioner asked, they were surprised. It didn't even
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.940]   come into God's mind that this would happen. But is that what it says, let alone means?
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.360]   Is that what Jeremiah wants us to understand, or what God meant for us to understand? And
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.040]   I doubt it. Very seriously, not only would that contradict his own, Jeremiah's own
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.760]   view of God's sovereignty expressed elsewhere in the book, like 32, 40, and 10, 23, and
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.480]   not only would it contradict the truth of God's foreknowledge taught all over the
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.920]   prophets like Isaiah 48, but more immediately, that's not what the text says. And it's
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.840]   not a necessary or obvious meaning either. Look at it more carefully. What precisely
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.180]   did not come to God's mind? It says, "I did not command or declare this slaughter
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.480]   of your children, nor did it," what's the "it," "come into my mind." What if
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.760]   I translate it like this, "Nor did it come into my mind to command or declare such a
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.920]   thing." I think that's what he means. It's just a natural way to read it. Instead
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.720]   of saying, "Oh, it never occurred to me that such a thing might happen by my sinful
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.480]   people," rather he's saying, "What never came into my mind is that I would command
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.660]   you to do such a thing or declare to you to do such a thing." And that's no contradiction
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.380]   of his sovereignty or his foreknowledge at all. So I don't think this text is a problem
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.000]   for a full view of God's foreknowledge or a full view of God's sovereignty.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.480]   And let me close like this. If you start to think around by talking to open theists that
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.780]   denying the foreknowledge of God, which they do, is a small thing and you can still be
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:44.500]   a Christian and be an Orthodox believer while disbelieving that God and Christ foreknow
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:56.020]   the future acts of morally responsible agents, consider this text. John 13, 19. Jesus says
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.720]   about the future morally responsible act of Judas' betrayal. He says, "I am telling
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:12.780]   you this now before it takes place, that when it does take place, you may believe that I
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.100]   am." Now, it's usually translated, "That I am he." There's no "he" in the Greek.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.620]   That you may believe that I am. What does that mean? Well, you know what that means.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:33.600]   That "I am" language is taken from Exodus 3 where God says, "I am who I am." And what
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:42.560]   Jesus is saying here is, "I'm telling you about a future act that is going to be performed
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.480]   by Judas so that you may believe that I am, that I am God, that I am divine." Which
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:58.960]   means this, implies this, beware of surrendering the foreknowledge of God because in doing
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:07.760]   so you are surrendering the Godness of God. And that is, you are surrendering God.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.000]   Yes, very good. Thank you, Pastor John. And I can imagine some listeners to this episode
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.040]   who are now asking the question, "Well then, do I have free will in choosing Jesus?" As
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.200]   Pastor John once put it, "When you get to heaven, if God asks you, 'What is the deepest,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.680]   decisive reason you believed on my Son?' What will your answer be? Will you say, 'The
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.800]   decisive reason for my choice was your grace,' or will you say, 'The decisive reason for
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.200]   my choice was me?'" That is a key question. And it's one that we addressed back in episode
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.480]   number 307. Be sure to check out that episode in the Ask Pastor John archive, most easily
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.600]   found in the app for the iPhone and Android.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.120]   So what does it mean in Romans 8:16 that the Spirit bears witness with our spirits that
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.840]   we are children of God? We'll ask that of John Piper tomorrow. My name is Tony Ranke.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.040]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
