[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.320]   blackmail me with money, go (beep) yourself.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.300]   Go (beep) yourself.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.380]   Is that clear?
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.300]   I hope it is.
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.840]   Hey, Bob, if you're in the audience.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.720]   - All right, Tucker, your response to the good for you.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.960]   G-F-Y.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.600]   - I mean, I've interviewed people every week
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   for over 30 years, and so I know what it is to interview.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.440]   (burps)
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.040]   I just dropped my Perrier, excuse me.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.680]   And I know, you know, I have a lot of experience
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.040]   interviewing people, and I've interviewed Elon,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.280]   and I don't understand how the New York Times character,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.860]   fussy little guy from the New York Times,
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.960]   how could you not laugh?
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   Like, what?
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.600]   He just told Bob Iger to (beep) himself.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.700]   - He's a terrible, terrible moderator.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.800]   - What a fussy little (beep), like, are you joking?
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.920]   Elon Musk just told Bob Iger to (beep) himself?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.280]   Like, I'd be texting my wife.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.960]   - My response is unbelievable.
