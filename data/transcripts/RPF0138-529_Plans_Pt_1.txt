[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.800]   - Today we continue our series on college planning
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.800]   with part one of the master class on 529 plans.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:42.800]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.020]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today is Wednesday,
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.280]   January 21, 2015.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.480]   Today we're gonna peel back the curtains
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.280]   on 529 plans, aka qualified tuition programs.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.140]   Gonna give you all the information that you need
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.880]   to use and exploit this account for your own benefit
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.280]   and also help you to avoid the big mistakes.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.440]   So probably one of the accounts
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.000]   that I get the most questions about
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and as a financial planner,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.960]   you have to be familiar with this account.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.880]   It seems like everybody is using a 529 plan.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.360]   And so today I'm gonna explain to you a lot
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.160]   and this is gonna be part one of a multi-part show.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.720]   I think for this topic, unlike doing what I did
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.360]   with the Coverdell Educational Savings Account Show,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.920]   which, by the way, you will want to listen to,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.960]   if you haven't heard it before listening to this show,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.520]   that show is episode 106.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.360]   You can find it at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/106
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.180]   or just search the archives page on the website
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180]   for Coverdell, C-O-V-E-R-D-E-L-L-S,
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.380]   C-O-V-E-R-D-E-L-L.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.820]   So unlike what I did with that
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.700]   where I put everything into one episode,
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.900]   I'm gonna split this out into a multi-part series.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.900]   And it's partly due to just me recognizing
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.580]   that many in the audience prefer the audio
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.460]   to be in more manageable chunks.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.820]   So sometimes it is better to take a four-hour show
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.620]   and split it out into maybe three or two
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.260]   or three or four individual shows.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.540]   But also due to the fact
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.860]   that there's some natural progression
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.860]   with the 529 accounts and the outline that I have
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.820]   that didn't exist with the Coverdell plans.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.040]   Now those of you who are daily listeners
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.180]   listening to the show immediately as it comes out,
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.580]   you will notice that I missed yesterday's show.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.100]   And the reason is I actually already recorded
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.700]   what you're hearing now, but I wasn't happy with it.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.100]   And I recorded part one, it was about an hour,
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.920]   of an introduction to the show.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.500]   And for I think the first time in the show's history,
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.200]   I decided to exercise my license of podcasting
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.000]   as compared to being on the radio to re-record that episode.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940]   I wasn't satisfied with it.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.660]   It didn't flow quite as well as I thought it should.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.700]   And so I've rearranged a few things in my outline today
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.820]   to make this show flow a little bit more smoothly
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.100]   and deliver a better resource for you.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.280]   I'm increasingly aware of the need
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.200]   to make each and every show world class.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.960]   I never know where a new listener's gonna come in
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.540]   and stumble into the show.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.540]   And so I want each exposure
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.260]   to the Radical Personal Finance brand
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.080]   to be positive and excellent.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.480]   So today we're gonna be actually re-recording
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.320]   part one of the show.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.960]   Because I missed yesterday's show,
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.040]   today will be extended beyond what was planned
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.880]   for one day's show.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.440]   As we begin our content,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   I want to ask you to stick with me through the content.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.240]   The information that I'm delivering to you today
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.920]   in this series of shows
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.160]   is master's degree level information.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.080]   It is not a watered down article
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.640]   that you can read easily at collegesavings.com.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.560]   This is in depth information.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   And 529 accounts are in some ways deceptively simple,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.720]   but extremely complicated.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.360]   It's very simple for me to convey the basic points
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.200]   of how they work.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.680]   I can do that in about 15 seconds
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.540]   and I'm gonna do that in just a moment.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.540]   But the actual details of how to apply these accounts,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.880]   it's not so simple.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.180]   So one of the things that I would encourage you
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.020]   is stick with me.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.200]   When I get into complex information,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.780]   if you don't understand all of the words,
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.400]   if you don't understand all of the terms,
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.800]   just stay with it, even so.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.400]   I had a mentor years ago
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.200]   who when I first began attending
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.120]   advanced financial planning courses and conferences,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.920]   encouraged me to go,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   even if I didn't understand all of the information,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.800]   and sometimes I just felt like I was swimming
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.600]   in a sea of words that didn't make any sense.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.360]   I often go to the estate planning words,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.000]   what is a defective grantor retained trust?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.040]   What is a grantor trust versus a non-funded trust?
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.360]   What is a funded account versus a non-funded account?
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.480]   All these different words
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.240]   that if you don't have the background,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.080]   you don't quite understand.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.000]   But what my mentor encouraged me,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.320]   he said, "This year you might understand
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.000]   "20% of the conference.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.880]   "Next year you might understand 40%.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.780]   "But in time, after a few years,
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.560]   "you'll start to understand all the terms."
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.020]   So even if you are a newbie to financial planning
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.800]   or you just stumbled across this show
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.160]   because you're trying to set up an account for your kids
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.120]   and try to figure out
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.200]   what's the best course of action for you,
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.960]   I ask you to stay with it and expand your knowledge.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.780]   Over time, the understanding comes.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.120]   Here's a quick outline of what you can expect
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.440]   as far as how the flow of these shows will go.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.040]   Today I'm going to give you a brief overview
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.160]   of the 529 plans and explain how they work.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.340]   I'm also going to outline for you
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.760]   who I think they're a good fit for
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.300]   and who I don't think they're a good fit for
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.240]   with some example financial planning scenarios.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.800]   Then I'm gonna go into the history of the 529 plan,
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.920]   even up until current day proposed changes
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.840]   of the law for these accounts.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.880]   And then I will be going through the major outline
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.960]   of some of the details of these plans
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.320]   based upon the IRS Publication 970's outline.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   That'll be it for,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.560]   that's what I anticipate covering in today's show.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   On another show, we'll go into the details
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.200]   of prepaid tuition programs,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.280]   all the things you need to know
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.760]   as you look to choose one of those.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.800]   On a different show, we will go into the details
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   of how to select among the savings programs
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.280]   and some of the details that you need to know
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.560]   as far as investment selection
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.580]   and some really applied advice for those.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.700]   And then possibly in a fourth show,
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.960]   we will wrap up a lot of the details surrounding,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.060]   we're gonna talk in detail about state income taxes,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.880]   other ancillary programs that are connected
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.360]   to these in certain states,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.380]   and some interesting planning uses of them
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.400]   and some interesting ways to exploit these
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.860]   for your own benefit and some things
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.380]   that were probably unintended
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.520]   that you can do with these accounts
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.240]   that I think will be helpful to you.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.480]   But let's start with a bit of an overview
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.360]   and explain how these accounts work.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.440]   So 529 plans, and you'll hear me refer to these accounts
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.800]   primarily as 529 plans.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.760]   The IRS in the formal literature
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.860]   calls these qualified tuition programs.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.580]   But the rules for a qualified tuition program
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.840]   are set down in section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   So you'll usually hear these referred to as 529 plans.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.520]   Since that's what's most common,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   that's what I use myself the most,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.960]   but I do go back and forth.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.800]   They're the same thing.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.040]   Qualified tuition program equals a 529 plan.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.320]   One misconception, however, that you will often hear
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.360]   and read if you're reading in mainstream financial press
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.480]   is in general, you will be left with the impression
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.360]   that a 529 plan applies only to some sort
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.660]   of savings program where you're setting aside money
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.080]   in a tax-advantaged way for the purpose of college savings.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.360]   And you'll hear the prepaid tuition programs,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.660]   so in my state, Florida, Florida prepaid is very popular,
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.580]   you'll hear the prepaid tuition programs
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.240]   referred to as something other than 529 plans.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.000]   I think this is what the average consumer understands
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.320]   to be the difference, that you have
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.480]   a prepaid tuition program or you have a 529 plan.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.120]   That is factually incorrect.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.240]   These plans are both authorized and governed
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.200]   by exactly the same section of the Internal Revenue Code.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.280]   And the rules, for the most part,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.480]   apply to both ways of organizing them.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   So both of those types of ideas,
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.240]   the prepaid savings program and the prepaid,
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.400]   excuse me, just the savings program
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.280]   or the prepaid tuition program,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.200]   both of those are 529 plans,
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.120]   both of them are qualified tuition programs.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.600]   So hopefully that will help you to distinguish them
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.160]   as you're reading a little bit in popular literature,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.200]   but recognize that usually they're gonna be talking about,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.720]   when you read articles on 529 plans,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.960]   they're talking about the prepaid savings programs.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.920]   These plans are massively popular
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.480]   and it's a rare client that I've ever interacted with
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.280]   that was concerned with doing
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.440]   some prudent financial planning
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.320]   who did not have some sort of 529 plan established.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.840]   And this is essentially the standard answer
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.560]   for most financial advisors with whom I have spoken
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.040]   or from whom I have learned what they propose to clients.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.320]   This is basically the standard approach.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.640]   If you wanna save for college,
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.600]   the financial advisor will most often
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.200]   recommend a 529 plan.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   529 plans, they are relatively straightforward.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.320]   They're relatively simple.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.200]   They're easy.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.520]   There are many options to choose among.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.080]   The paperwork is fairly simple.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.600]   So as an advisor, they're very simple for you
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.520]   to help a client set up.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.200]   Now, whether or not they're the right approach or not,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.920]   that's a very involved question.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.680]   My personal opinion is,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.920]   if I were in charge of giving advice
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.560]   on most financial plans,
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.880]   I would very rarely recommend to most people
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.280]   that they use a 529 plan.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.200]   I think that the application,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.280]   which I see most commonly,
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.960]   which is the idea that we're gonna set aside $150 a month
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.320]   into Johnny's 529 plan,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.440]   or we're gonna set aside and we're gonna buy
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.960]   two years of tuition credits
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.920]   at our state university for Susie,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.400]   and we're gonna go ahead and pay that off
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.440]   over the next 18 years.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.120]   I believe that the application of that kind of application
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.800]   is, for most people, not a very good idea.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.280]   And there are a number of reasons for that.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.360]   One reason is simply that most people
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.240]   are flipping the order that they should be approaching
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.640]   their financial planning.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.400]   I feel that it's far more important for most people
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.120]   to be focused on their own financial independence
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.640]   and their own retirement funding
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.520]   before they ever focus on college.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.760]   There are many, many options and ways
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.520]   to approach college funding.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.160]   There are many fewer options and ways
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.560]   to approach retirement funding.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.000]   And yet most parents who establish a 529 account
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.800]   for their child are doing so
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.600]   because of this intense desire
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.560]   to help their children do better.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.520]   And so they sacrifice their own future
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.760]   to help their children succeed as they perceive it to be.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.400]   As they perceive the college degree,
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.200]   having that funded will be helpful
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.640]   for their child's success.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   Although I applaud the nobility of that motive,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.960]   I think it's wrong and it's not a good motive.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.240]   Far better to approach some of the other funding strategies
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.480]   that I've talked about and will continue to talk about.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.360]   For example, far better for a parent, in my opinion,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.520]   to focus on funding their retirement
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.320]   and then just simply stop funding their retirement
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.280]   during the years that their child is in college
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.840]   and contribute to the college education out of cash flow.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.680]   For example, if somebody is putting money
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.240]   into a 401k and they're contributing,
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.600]   let's say they're maxing the account out
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.840]   at 17, 18,000 bucks a year,
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.160]   then well, let's just stop for four years,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.920]   putting the $17,000 into that account
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.840]   and use that money to pay for the child's education.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.560]   I would rather see that than to see the person
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.800]   putting all kinds of money into the 529 plan.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.560]   And the reason is because we don't usually know
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.480]   what's gonna happen with college.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.600]   This is the big blind spot that many people have
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.080]   is they perceive that college
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.320]   and the value of a college education
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.600]   is the same as it was in 1950.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.200]   It's simply not.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.320]   Today, there is no reason whatsoever
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.440]   that any child who wants to go to school
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.680]   and who is reasonably academically capable,
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.480]   enough that they should be going to more academic,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.600]   through more academic study,
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.420]   you can do it with a part-time job
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.380]   and get a fully accredited degree.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.580]   I'm gonna do an entire show on options for this,
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.320]   but you can get them as low as 4,000 bucks now
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   for a full tuition cost for an accredited degree.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.800]   There are proposals, which I'll comment on in just a moment,
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.240]   but President Obama even now is proposing
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   to make the community college tuition to be completely free.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.360]   In fact, let's go right there.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.780]   That's the second thing, is the value,
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.240]   as perceived by the marketplace,
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.600]   the value that is being placed on a college tuition,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.080]   I believe, is changing.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.160]   Now, this is one where I can't prove it with statistics
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.440]   'cause the statistics are backward-looking,
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.320]   but if you just open your eyes a little bit
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.480]   and look around in the press
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.400]   and just read about what you're reading about,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.180]   and you see major companies, the leaders,
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.360]   walking away from the value of the college degree
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.780]   in their hiring practices, that should tell you something.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.240]   I think you can get a good indication
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.080]   even of the value of a college degree
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.200]   as indicated by President Obama's proposal.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.840]   When you make something free,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.760]   it's because the value is either pretty low
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.160]   or it's gonna drive the value low.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.040]   And community colleges have already been essentially free,
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.560]   so that value there is low,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.040]   and as they are made free with a show of populist support,
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.880]   trying to gain support,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.280]   well, we're gonna support low-income families to do that.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.220]   I think that's probably a pretty good indication
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.260]   that the value of college is pretty much gone
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.340]   because as it stands right now,
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.880]   education is free
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:53.100]   and has been for a very long period now in human history.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.880]   You can trot right down to the library
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.600]   and you can learn just about anything you need to learn.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.260]   You can open up your phone,
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.380]   access a computer connection, an internet connection.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.800]   If you don't have one, go to the library
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.440]   and use the free internet connection that's sitting there,
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.940]   and you can get all the education that you need.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.480]   Now, the credentials are not free,
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.360]   but there are plenty of cheap ways to get those credentials,
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.620]   and the value of those credentials
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.860]   seems to be really dropping in the marketplace.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.700]   That's my opinion.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.080]   I can't prove it to you at the moment,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.520]   but that's just simply my personal observation.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.460]   I could be wrong.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.480]   Again, most of the research indicates
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.100]   that investing in education still pays off in earning power,
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.860]   but I've not seen, anyway,
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.520]   you get into causation, correlation, that type of thing,
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   which causes me to question that, and I'm not the only one.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.280]   One of my major points with parents is just simply,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   how do you predict where things are gonna be in 15 years
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.800]   with the current rapid pace of change in our society?
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.080]   And change has always been rapid,
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.360]   but it certainly seems to be changing substantially.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.480]   If you go back, if you have a young child,
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.420]   and you go back 15 years and think about
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.720]   what the world looked like in 2000,
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.120]   and compare that to what the difference
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.040]   between 1985 and 2000, there was a lot of change,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.440]   and go back another 15 years,
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.340]   go from 1985 back to 1970, just compare the rate of change,
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.400]   the world of 2030 is going to be dramatically different,
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.820]   and one of those massive changes
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.980]   is going to be the structure of the schooling system.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.300]   Now, just because Joshua has that opinion,
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.600]   which regular listeners know certainly is,
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.040]   certainly an opinion that I have,
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.780]   doesn't mean that you can't use this kind of account
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.400]   for your benefit, but I do like to point out
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.600]   and explain the limited benefit of this account
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.760]   for most people who are contributing.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.320]   How it's not, it's just simply, it's not a panacea,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.720]   it's not a magic cure-all.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.120]   So let's get into how it works,
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.200]   and so ignore for a moment,
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.160]   well, the tuition credit programs, those are fairly simple,
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.360]   and basically you contract with
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.680]   either your state school system
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.540]   or an independent consortium of private colleges,
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.060]   which we'll go over, I'll tell you how to use
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.720]   the tuition credit to fund private universities,
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.300]   so if you came from a prestigious Ivy League school
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.280]   that's a private university of some kind,
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.600]   and you're sure that your son or daughter
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.560]   is going to attend that school,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.540]   you can just go ahead and purchase
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.560]   those tuition credits today,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.460]   and I'll explain that in a future show.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.400]   But the tuition credits are fairly simple,
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.560]   you just pay the price that is negotiated
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.960]   by the state that is offering you the program.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.160]   On the savings programs,
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.760]   the accounts in today's world function
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.640]   in some way similar to a Roth IRA.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.100]   You fund the accounts with after-tax dollars,
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.000]   so you do not get any up-front deduction
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.360]   for putting money into this account.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.320]   As the money stays in the account
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.160]   and grows, hopefully, with the performance
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.160]   of your investments, then that growth is tax-deferred,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.220]   and when you take the money out
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.900]   and use it to pay for qualified education expenses,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.080]   those funds come out tax-free,
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.920]   could be used to pay for that.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.600]   Now, anytime you get into a tax benefit,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.420]   or anytime you get into one of these accounts,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.280]   you need to actually calculate for yourself
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.540]   what is the potential tax benefit.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.820]   Very few people ever actually calculate
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.180]   what the potential tax benefits would be.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.080]   And so let me use, in my own personal planning scenario,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.200]   I have a one-year-old son,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.300]   let me use him as an example
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.860]   of what we could or could not do.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.920]   Let's assume for the moment that he's one year old,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.600]   and we're gonna be saving for his college,
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.860]   and we're assuming he's gonna go to college
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.280]   at the standard age of 18.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.500]   So that gives us a 17-year investment time horizon.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.280]   Let's assume that we have calculated our budget,
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.140]   and we found that we can afford to allocate $100 a month
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.340]   for the savings toward his college tuition.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.860]   I can get in, I've gotten into in previous shows
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.660]   about how to actually calculate
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.860]   the amount needed for college.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.820]   If you're interested in that,
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.360]   go back and listen to those shows.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.380]   Specifically, that would be episode 101,
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.820]   which was entitled "How to Calculate
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.400]   "How Much You Need to Save for Your Kid's College."
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.020]   But for this illustration,
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.300]   we're not trying to hit its targeted amount,
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.900]   we've just decided we can save $100 a month.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.540]   And this is a fairly normal approach
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.900]   among many people with whom I have worked.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.980]   And let's assume that we're just going to put the money
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.140]   into an investment account,
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.940]   and let's assume that we're going to earn
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.500]   a nominal return after fees of 7%.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.440]   So in our investment account
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.020]   that we're funding this account with.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.940]   So we just pull out our little financial calculator,
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.220]   and you clear the registry, you hit 17,
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.660]   hit your little button to switch it to monthly,
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.480]   'cause we're gonna make monthly contributions.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.360]   So that comes out to be 204 periods,
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.300]   204 months is how much we're gonna be investing for.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.720]   Put 7% in, turn that into a monthly number,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.280]   that's .58% interest compounded monthly,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.960]   starting with $0 and $100 as our payment.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.440]   And hit your future value button,
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.680]   and that'll tell you what the future value
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.920]   of this account would be.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.800]   The future value in this scenario is $39,240.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.460]   So if we calculate how much we've contributed
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.780]   to the account, we've invested for 204 months,
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.780]   so 204 times 100 equals $20,400.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.260]   So our total contributions to the account are $20,400,
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.460]   and we have $39,240 in the account.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.460]   For the sake of straightforward,
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.900]   easily understood verbal numbers,
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.820]   let me assume that's $40,000,
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.880]   and we've contributed $20,000 to the account.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.900]   So we essentially have $20,000
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.020]   of capital gain in this account.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.540]   What that means is that now I can use that money,
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.100]   and I can use it to pay for college expenses,
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.300]   and I will not have to pay the income tax
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.060]   on that $20,000 of gain.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.260]   Well, how much is that income tax rate?
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.300]   I think it would be comparable to say,
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.500]   this would probably, if I weren't using
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.720]   a qualified college account for this type of investing,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.940]   let's just assume I can do it at capital gains tax rates
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.700]   of say 20%.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.300]   Current highest capital gains tax rate, 20%,
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.180]   ignoring the 3.8% Obamacare taxes.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.580]   Let's just say 20%.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.220]   So what would be the actual tax savings
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.060]   at a 20% rate on $20,000?
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.980]   The answer is $4,000.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.700]   So by using this 529 account, this illustration,
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.220]   me saving for my one-year-old son,
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.740]   I would be able to save a total of $4,000 of tax.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.720]   Is that substantial?
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.400]   Maybe, depending on your specific scenario.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.380]   Tax planning, good tax planning is never one thing.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.720]   People often ask, Joshua, what's the one thing you can do?
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.980]   There is no one thing.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.480]   There are a lot of little things.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.820]   And if you do enough little things over time,
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.700]   that accounts to be a massive amount of savings.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.860]   For $4,000, it doesn't get me that excited,
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.660]   especially when I look and say,
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.680]   well, are there some ways to dramatically affect
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.260]   the overall cost of college
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.760]   that will have a much greater impact than $4,000?
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.760]   Could I get an extra $4,000 of financial aid for my student
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.160]   by not having the money saved?
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.040]   Seems to me that would be a pretty easy thing to do.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.720]   So instead of having the money saved and having it counted,
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.780]   why don't I just take advantage
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.140]   of the financial aid programs?
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.340]   Couldn't I get some scholarship money
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.420]   to make up that difference
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.640]   and wouldn't that make a bigger difference?
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.220]   All of those things can be done.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.740]   Just because you have money saved
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.480]   doesn't mean you can't get financial aid.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.740]   Just because you get financial aid or have money saved
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.180]   doesn't mean you can't qualify for scholarships.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.380]   My point is that $4,000,
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.700]   you have to look at it in terms of your scale and ask,
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.140]   is that a good assumption or not?
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.040]   Now, one challenge is that I use that 7% net of fees number
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.100]   for our investment return.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.340]   What if it were higher?
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.300]   So what if instead of 7%, you could actually get 10%?
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.140]   Well, under this scenario, if you could get a 10% return,
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.980]   you would have $53,000 in the account
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.340]   at the time for college,
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.540]   which taking out the $20,000 of contributions
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.260]   would leave you with about $33,000 of gain.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.020]   So now that would improve things.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.500]   But here's the question.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   If you're actually investing for a medium-term goal,
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.980]   like college, which has a defined price tag,
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.220]   are you going to be comfortable
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.780]   with high volatility in that account?
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.680]   And how are you going to account for it as you get closer?
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.560]   My observation has been that
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.600]   it's a little harder to make this work.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.580]   So unlike in retirement planning,
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.640]   where I can say to a retiree, listen,
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.980]   you're gonna be retired for a very long period of time.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.420]   So even if you are in this year retiring,
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.820]   you still have a 30-year investment time horizon,
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.980]   and thus I can make a case for broader exposure
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.300]   to potentially higher returning asset classes,
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.480]   i.e. equities instead of bonds.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.740]   It's hard for me to make that case here
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.380]   to somebody with college,
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.540]   because starting at the age of 14, excuse me, 13,
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.500]   we're five years out from the age of 18
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.280]   when we're gonna need college money.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.040]   And even at our five-year time horizon,
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.700]   which is often where mentally you start to think about
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.140]   how do I shift a portfolio
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.500]   from potentially volatile investment assets
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.340]   over to a less volatile approach,
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.180]   you can start to think about it
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.880]   at the five-year time horizon,
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.020]   that still happens at the child's age 17,
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.220]   'cause the most cash,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.340]   like our cash flow needs are pretty much done at 22,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.540]   unless the child needs to go to graduate school.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.660]   So managing the portfolio for this purpose
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.820]   is a little bit tougher.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.820]   Compare even that to my solution,
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.300]   such as one of my preferred solutions,
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.340]   such as funding a retirement account.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.480]   If we're funding a retirement account,
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.020]   and let's say that we're planning to use
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.740]   the exception to tax penalties
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.440]   under the education exception
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.900]   to early distributions from an IRA,
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.940]   let's say we're gonna use that as a funding plan,
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.940]   or we're gonna use, hey, I'm contributing to my 401(k)
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.780]   and I'm just gonna stop or lower my contributions
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.060]   for these years while my child is in college
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.460]   to make up for the amounts that I'm putting in there.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.900]   If you compare these two plans,
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.540]   at least in the retirement account,
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.260]   if the volatility is,
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.220]   we're in a period where the market is down
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.500]   and our investments are low in value,
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.900]   well, you've still got a long time horizon
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.540]   'cause you just use the money later for college,
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.660]   excuse me, for retirement,
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.260]   and you can find, you can cash flow the need.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.660]   Unlike in a 529 account,
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.220]   where if it's all designated for college,
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.060]   it's a little bit trickier
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.140]   to get the benefit of the money out.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.400]   So because of this challenge of how do we do the,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.980]   how do we actually calculate this stuff out,
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.580]   I think that 10% is certainly much higher number
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.980]   than I would ever use as a projection
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.620]   for a return on investments in a college account
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.860]   when we're managing a portfolio
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.900]   for this fixed period of time.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.660]   7% is probably a little bit aggressive,
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.740]   and I would guess that of many of the allocation plans
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.580]   that I have reviewed,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.060]   maybe somewhere on the order of 4% or 5%
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.340]   would be much more appropriate
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.540]   as far as an expected return from a portfolio.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.940]   Well, if we put 5% in instead of 7%,
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.420]   then our future value after 17 years of investing,
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.260]   oops, I did this wrong,
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.940]   17, 5%, zero PV, $100 a month.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.940]   Our future value after 17 years of investing now
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.860]   is $32,186.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.860]   Pull out our $20,000 of contributions,
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.980]   and we have $12,000 of gain at a 20% tax rate.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.420]   That means we're avoiding $2,437 of taxes.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.380]   And I think this is what many people
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.180]   who are participating in 529 plans are facing.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:29.060]   Now, again, this is anecdotal from my observations,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.740]   but I think it's pretty accurate.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.000]   I feel pretty good about this guess.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.400]   I just don't really see the point.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.320]   When there are so many other things that can be done,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.440]   take my plan, one of my plans, skip college,
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.640]   stop wasting money on expensive private schools
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.520]   and expensive tutors,
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.720]   and stop wasting money
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.760]   for an expensive public school district.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.840]   Pull your child out, put him in education at home,
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.960]   and plan to have, with a combination of CLEP tests,
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.520]   AP exams, and dual enrolled credit at a community college,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.160]   which will be free soon enough,
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   and is practically free now,
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.440]   have the four-year degree done by the age of 18,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.280]   and forget about the college account.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.080]   Now, that's what I think makes a lot more sense
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.240]   for an average mainstream person.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.440]   Is any of this analysis necessarily a problem
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.480]   of a 529 plan?
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.880]   No, and I'm gonna show you how a 529 plan
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.560]   could be incredibly useful.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.120]   The point is not whether one account is better
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.680]   or what you should do.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.440]   The point is to use that lens of scale
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.320]   that I've recently talked about,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.000]   and think about how you could establish something
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.180]   that works for you.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.880]   As a financial planner,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.080]   there is a big difference in my need to plan.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.680]   If I'm working with one client who says,
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.080]   "You know what, I've got an engineering degree
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.860]   "from a university that's near me,
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.240]   "Florida Atlantic University.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.000]   "It's a perfectly good university.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.760]   "It's a state of Florida school.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.020]   "It's in Boca Raton, Florida,
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.120]   "which is relatively near where I live.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.440]   "I've got a degree from there.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.240]   "I think I had a great experience there,
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.300]   "and I wanna make sure that we just have
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.940]   "a little bit of money to pay for that,
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.520]   "and help our child to go there."
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.640]   That's a very different scenario,
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.840]   and get their undergraduate degree.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.960]   That's very different than if a client comes to me
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.960]   and says, "I'm a graduate of a prestigious big-name school,
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   "Harvard, Yale, Brown, Cornell,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.280]   "some school with 150, $200,000 price tag.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.060]   "And more importantly, I'm a big believer
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.020]   "in advanced education.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.900]   "After all, I'm a doctor, I'm an attorney.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.960]   "I'm a PhD in some arcane field,
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.860]   "and I wanna make sure that I have enough money
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.720]   "to send my child through medical school,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.820]   "or through graduate school of some kind
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.600]   "at an expensive university,
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.680]   "so that they can build their social structure,
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.200]   "and make sure that they're involved
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.280]   "in the who's who of the decision makers of our country."
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.200]   That's a very different scenario.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.840]   And so now, the advantages and disadvantages,
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.440]   what to do in one case versus what to do in another
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.800]   is gonna be very different.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.080]   So those are the limitations that I see
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.920]   at the 529 account.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.000]   Now let's talk about what are some ways
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.920]   that you could use the account,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.400]   and how it could be much more useful.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.440]   Well, one of the first things you could do
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.680]   is if you could increase the investment return.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   That could be useful.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.020]   It's a little tough to do, though,
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.520]   because 529 accounts are relatively restricted
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.600]   on what they are invested in.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.320]   They're either invested at whatever the state says,
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.200]   at a guaranteed return based upon the tuition credits
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.400]   that you buy, and you can calculate that,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.200]   or they're invested with relatively mainstream mutual funds.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.960]   And you're going to be subject
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.720]   to whatever the mainstream mutual fund returns are.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.120]   It's not a problem.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.000]   Might be perfectly great, or it might not be.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.040]   You would have gotten hammered
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.160]   if you bought a mainstream mutual fund in 2000
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   for your 10-year-old, your eight-year-old child,
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.800]   and then in 2010, needed to get the money out for college.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.480]   That probably wouldn't have worked
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.880]   in most of those scenarios.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.400]   So it's tough to influence rate of return,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.520]   and unlike the Coverdell program where I talked about
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.680]   you could do some more aggressive types of investing,
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.640]   can't do that here.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:33.420]   But you could extend the time horizon.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.400]   And the other major key for 529 plans
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.240]   is you could front load it.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.560]   Here would be the example.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.760]   Let me use my $100 a month example,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.440]   and we calculated that total I would be investing
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.840]   into that account $20,400 over 17 years
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.480]   to fund my one-year-old son's education.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.600]   Let's say that instead of funding this at $100 a month,
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.560]   I choose today to write a check for $20,400
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.840]   into the account.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.920]   What would be the value of the account
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.520]   at that same 7% interest in 17 years?
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.280]   Well, let's just plug it in our calculator.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.000]   $20,400, change the sign, put it in as our present value.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.200]   17 years.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.160]   Let's compound this monthly to make sure that's the same.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.040]   So that's 204 periods, 7%, that's 0.58% per month,
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.400]   and zero payments into the account.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.880]   Well, now my future value in this account is $66,825.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   All I've done here is change,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.520]   and instead of putting $100 a month
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.360]   of periodic payments into the account, I front loaded it.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.800]   So the full amount can be earning interest along the way.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   $66,825 compares to our previous number of $39,240.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:55.240]   It's a big difference.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   That's an extra $27,585 of tax-free gain in the account
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:08.080]   simply because I front loaded it.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.280]   And this is a huge advantage of the 529 plans.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.260]   You can make contributions to these accounts
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.080]   up to the annual gift tax exclusion amounts.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.720]   So in 2014 and in 2015, this number is $14,000 per person.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.400]   The annual gift tax exclusion amount is the amount of money
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.180]   that any individual can give to another individual
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.720]   without paying gift tax on the amount.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.800]   So anybody can give $14,000 to any other person
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.840]   for $14,000, and there's no tax on that transfer.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.080]   There's no gift tax on the transfer.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.160]   Whether or not there's income tax on the transfer
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.000]   will depend upon the assets that are actually transferred.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.800]   It's a conversation for another day,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.040]   whether they're appreciated assets
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.380]   or whether they're just cash assets or whatever they are.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.960]   But just for now, assume that there's no tax on the transfer.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.000]   The other nice thing is that you can do
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.320]   what is called split gifting,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.600]   which means that if you're married,
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.320]   you and your spouse can both choose
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.620]   to make a gift contribution to any other person.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.120]   So now you can give $28,000,
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.800]   and that's a fairly straightforward thing to do.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   In a 529 account, you can contribute up to five years
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.680]   of that amount into the account,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.080]   and for technical purposes, it will be considered
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.720]   to have been given over five years,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.860]   even though you gave it all in the first year,
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.280]   which means that let's assume now
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.080]   that my wife and I are somewhat wealthy
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.800]   and we're looking for intelligent things to do,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.920]   and education and college and higher education
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.040]   is a big deal to us, and we want to set aside money
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.780]   for our grandchildren.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.080]   Now, we don't have any grandchildren yet,
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.200]   but here's what's cool.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.780]   That doesn't matter.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.060]   We can make the beneficiary of the account ourselves,
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.200]   we can make the beneficiary of the account our children,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.400]   and then we can just transition this
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.000]   to be our grandchildren.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.920]   And we can put, for each individual beneficiary,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.880]   we could put 28,000 times five,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.880]   so $140,000 into that account right now.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.360]   So, play a little game with me.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.360]   Assume that I establish an account right now for my son,
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.280]   and I front load that with $140,000 of capital
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.240]   into the account.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.960]   So I put in $140,000, that's the present value,
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.160]   let's put in 17 years for the number of years,
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.040]   let's do this monthly, let's put in our 7% interest
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   compounded monthly, no future contributions.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   Now, with that amount put in, I've got $458,000
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.400]   established to fund my child's college.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.700]   And all of that gain would be tax free.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.520]   All of it, if used for higher education expenses.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.800]   But this would be really cool.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.960]   Let's say that instead of using that,
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.800]   although I could use that for my son's college,
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.760]   and I could calculate pooling out $200,000
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.200]   and then the balance staying in the account
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.920]   for a grandchild, it's a little hard to do,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.640]   a little cumbersome over audio.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.900]   But let's just assume that instead of doing this
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.900]   for 17 years, I do this for 17 years plus 25.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.640]   Assume that my son gets married and has a child
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.040]   at 25 years old, so that gives me 42 years
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.520]   of investment time horizon.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.120]   And I fund this account, $140,000 today,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   42 years compounded monthly, 7% compounded monthly,
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.320]   zero dollars into the account.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   After 42 years, this account would have $2,625,000.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.960]   694.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.540]   $2,625,694.27.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.480]   That's pretty exciting when you consider the fact
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.520]   that I put in only $140,000 of capital up front.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.520]   So my total gain in the account is $2,485,000,
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.420]   which if used for college education,
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.320]   is completely income tax free.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.980]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.960]   And what's cool about this is I don't have to go
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.520]   through the hassle of setting up an elaborate trust.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.800]   I don't have to actually make a completed gift
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.440]   to the child.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.640]   I can have full control over this money,
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.280]   I can change beneficiaries, so unlike setting up
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.560]   some sort of transfer with a custodial account
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.360]   such as a UTMA or a UGMA account,
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.480]   where that money, no matter what, is going to be transferred
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.200]   to the child at their age of majority,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.680]   I can pull this money back.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.580]   I can use it.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.000]   In fact, if I don't like any of them,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.920]   I can change it to be for me.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.180]   And my wife and I, we might go and sign up
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.000]   for a four year university in Paris,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.880]   and we might go and get French degrees in Paris
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.600]   and pay for it all out of this account,
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.520]   and consider that for four years of our retirement plans,
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.900]   and just pay for it with this account.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.200]   So there are a lot of options,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.800]   and that's where these 529 accounts really tend to shine.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.680]   Again, nothing wrong with the account.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.720]   The problem is how they're applied usually.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.640]   I hope that's kind of a unique introduction
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.160]   to understand what you can do.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.160]   And 529, since they were invented,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.880]   have been a very useful tool for financial advisors.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.620]   Very useful tool.
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.200]   They're unique.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.480]   Now, where I'd like to go from here,
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.360]   one comment before we get into the history of the plan.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:40.520]   It's unlikely, this is, 529, it's unlikely that you're gonna,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.640]   this is another one of those examples
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.180]   of where it's tough to get great financial advice on it.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.120]   If you wanna go out and ask a financial advisor
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.280]   just to handle your 529 account, good luck finding one.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.320]   I personally would never have accepted this from a client,
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.000]   simply because there's not enough money
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.180]   to make any compensation where it's worth the responsibility
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.900]   that I would hold towards a client.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.440]   So when I was practicing officially,
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.040]   then we would do 529 accounts,
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.480]   but as a service for clients who had other assets,
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.360]   or other services, or other planning needs,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.760]   or other products with it.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.360]   So if you listen to this show, or this series of shows,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.620]   you'll probably have more knowledge about this
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.640]   than many financial advisors.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.480]   So just recognize that, you're probably,
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.760]   this is one of those where you gotta do it yourself,
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.200]   and you gotta think through it yourself.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.640]   It's not good business practice for a financial advisor
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.240]   to spend several hours going through these things
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.120]   when there's a total potential compensation of,
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.760]   if you're gonna do it $100 a month,
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.120]   might make $3 a month of compensation.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.080]   You can't run a business that way.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:43.920]   So hopefully that helps.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.240]   Just listen, focus on this show,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.900]   and then you'll figure out what you wanna do.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.720]   If you have an advisor with whom you have other services,
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.400]   other products, other planning relationships,
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.080]   then go ahead and lean on that person for information here.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.200]   But it's just tough to,
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.480]   it's tough to find a good advisor
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.160]   who's gonna work with you on this information.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.200]   That's just the reality of the situation.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.720]   Now, let's get into the history a little bit.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.040]   And this history is important.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.720]   I'm gonna take some time to go through this.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   Because it will give you some insight
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.800]   into how these types of things come to be.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.520]   And you might be able to apply that insight
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.320]   to other areas of your financial planning.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.840]   One question which I'm often asked is,
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.680]   "Joshua, are you concerned about the rules changing
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.520]   "on things like retirement accounts?"
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.240]   The fiscal situation that we face in the United States
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.260]   is that we're broke, practically bankrupt,
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.800]   but we won't admit it.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.160]   And so our economic system just continues forward.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.560]   And you have what purports to be a debate
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.920]   between the Democrat Party and the Republican Party,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.040]   where in essence, the Democrat Party is supposedly known for
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.680]   we wanna raise taxes on the rich,
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.880]   and that's gonna fund the problems,
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.260]   that's gonna fund the government.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.320]   And the Republican Party is supposedly known as
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.880]   we're gonna cut taxes on the rich and on everybody else,
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.680]   and that's gonna fund the economic situation.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.200]   That's gonna fund the shortfalls.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.480]   The reality is, is that although each party
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.960]   says that they're different,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.320]   they both do exactly the same thing when push comes to shove
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.640]   and when during times of economic recession,
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.200]   economic hardship, then regardless,
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.360]   and you'll see this proven in this history
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.720]   that I'm gonna go over with you,
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.400]   you see that taxes are cut.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.360]   And it happens under Democrat presidents
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.720]   and Democrat Congresses, or Democratic Congress,
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.400]   and it happens under Republican presidents
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.600]   or Republican Congress.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.520]   And so you practically have two parties that are,
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.800]   in essence, exactly the same and do exactly the same thing,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.000]   but their rhetoric has to satisfy a different interest group
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.800]   So one of the challenges of thinking through things
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.120]   like IRAs is when I look at the reality of
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.040]   the fiscal situation of this country,
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.080]   depending on which estimate you use,
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:17.900]   you'll get different estimates of how massive the problem is.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.560]   Some estimates you read are that the US government
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.640]   has approximately $150 trillion in debt
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   and unfunded liabilities, which includes the amount that
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.340]   the government is behind, the amount that's not funded
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.160]   to pay for the three big social programs,
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.580]   Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.640]   Some estimates go as high as about $220 trillion.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.440]   My source for that is Professor Lawrence Kotlikoff
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.560]   from Boston University.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.840]   I've never found any reason to dispute his numbers,
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.700]   so I usually would just quote a $220 trillion problem.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:57.120]   And so you look and say, how can that be solved?
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.920]   And I don't personally see any viable solution
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.240]   to how that's gonna be solved in the long run.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.220]   But in the short run, who knows how long it can go on?
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.640]   That's the question.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.020]   And the other question is, well, what changes are there?
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.980]   Well, tax-advantaged programs are referred to
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.020]   by tax wonks as expenditures, tax expenditures.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.660]   So there's a listing, and these are constantly debated
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.760]   in Congress and in committees about,
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.620]   well, where are we gonna get the money from?
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.940]   And how are we gonna get the taxes to be raised?
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.240]   Tax expenditures, based upon my memory,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.160]   I think they were popularized by, I forget the name,
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.360]   but the guy who was the Treasury Secretary in the late '60s.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.320]   And he came up with the idea of,
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.080]   instead of funding something
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.320]   directly from the government coffers,
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.440]   why don't we just simply offer a tax incentive
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.160]   and a tax bonus, and that will incentivize people
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.620]   to take a certain course of action,
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:58.360]   which we have decided is in line with our national values.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.920]   And so this is what you see.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.800]   This has become, it's theoretically,
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.000]   and probably a much more efficient system.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.360]   As an example, why do we, well,
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.640]   it's a much more efficient system.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.240]   But it's also a system that in some ways
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.460]   is easier to account for or is easier not to account for.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.300]   So you constantly see that the tax code is built
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.240]   to incentivize certain courses of action.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.980]   So the powers that be have decided
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.160]   that it's in the best interest of this nation
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.720]   that people are homeowners.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.360]   So therefore, the tax code incentivizes home ownership
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   by giving a deduction for real estate mortgage interest
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   on a primary residence.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.800]   It gives a deduction for real estate property taxes.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.540]   We've decided that it's in the best interest
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.400]   for employers to fund and provide health insurance
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.280]   for their employees.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.320]   So it gives a deduction, a full deduction,
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.800]   for the costs and the contributions of employers
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.080]   to the health insurance payments.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.040]   We've also decided that it's in the best interest
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.960]   of this nation that people save to fund a retirement.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   And so that's why tax schemes such as IRAs, 401(k) plans,
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.360]   pension plans, why these have the tax rules they have,
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.420]   Roth IRAs, et cetera.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.540]   Now, it's tough for me to think through and figure out
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:23.800]   what would actually happen or could the rules change.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.640]   I have a few disadvantages for my thinking.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.060]   Number one is because of my relatively young age,
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.740]   I haven't been paying attention to how politics
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.360]   actually functions for really all that long.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.680]   I probably started paying attention in my mid teens
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.760]   and now at almost 30, that only gives me a decade
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.280]   and a half of observation.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.320]   In that decade and a half, I figured out that
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.760]   although the politicians say they do some things differently
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.400]   they don't actually do anything differently
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.880]   when it actually comes down to it.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.320]   But when I look at the political reality,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.320]   I do see that the, I guess the voting power of the populace
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.480]   I think still has power.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.040]   And when you look at things like tax changes,
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.560]   Congress still has to approve of certain things.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.820]   And that's as it should be.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.240]   So I look at it with a political reality
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.160]   and it's very difficult for me to conceive
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:23.160]   that people are, most people have 401ks,
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.800]   most people have IRAs and in the US system
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.760]   you're promised a certain benefit.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.200]   Now would the population just simply give up that benefit
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.120]   and allow for a tax increase without
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.320]   raising a ruckus about it?
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.200]   I don't know.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.460]   That one's hard for me to know.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.200]   And so one of my research projects
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.160]   that I've been trying to do is trying to get a handle
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.360]   on that question.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.960]   I still don't have a handle on the question.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.600]   I was surprised at how little outrage there was last year
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.840]   when President Obama in his budget proposal
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.160]   proposed taxing IRA accounts over a certain amount.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.640]   Now that hasn't come to fruition.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.520]   Still gotta get through Congress and same thing.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.200]   But I was surprised how little outrage there was.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.120]   And I've wondered if maybe that weren't a bit of a
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.920]   precursor, something I need to pay attention to.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.200]   It's very difficult for me to know how to answer
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.080]   that question at this point.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.440]   But that's the reason why I'm going to the history here
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.960]   of the 529 accounts.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.340]   Because I never had time when I was a practicing
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.360]   financial planner, excuse me, I never made time
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.880]   when I was a practicing financial planner
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.980]   to go through and try to figure out some of the history
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.400]   of these types of accounts to figure out how in the future
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.660]   context things could change.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.040]   But now in preparation for shows like this, I can do that.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.200]   So let me give you the history of how
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.160]   these accounts came to be.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.360]   They, unlike most programs, these accounts were actually
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.280]   begun at a state level, specifically with the state
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.840]   of Michigan.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.840]   And Michigan in, was it late, no, during the 80s,
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:55.040]   Michigan had an idea to try to help control
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.720]   the costs of tuition.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.140]   And from the periods of the 70s and the 80s,
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.880]   there were massive increases in the cost
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.900]   of college tuition.
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.040]   You can fact check me, but going off of memory,
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.080]   I think for that period, the annual increase in the price
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.840]   of college tuition was about somewhere around 9%
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.120]   for much of those two decades.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.160]   So the state of Michigan came up with a plan
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.440]   to create a prepaid tuition program.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.860]   And essentially their idea was to establish a fund
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.840]   into which the residents of that state could pay money
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.680]   at a fixed rate in exchange for a promise that the fund
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.920]   would pay for the tuition at a Michigan government run
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.380]   college or university.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.400]   So this would have been pretty attractive
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   because it allowed you to control a cost of,
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.840]   to rein in a no for a fixed cost today,
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   something that is an unsure, it's unsure how much
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.700]   the price is gonna increase in the future.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.600]   Which incidentally, make sure you connect the dots
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.240]   between that and the alpha strategy,
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.680]   which I've spoken about on this show,
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.160]   which is in essence, one way to control the increasing
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.220]   cost of certain items, especially items that are heavily
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.600]   subject to inflation, is simply to purchase the item.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.960]   And the benefit of doing it this way is you lock in,
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.040]   you lock it in for a known cost,
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.880]   and because you have a need for the item,
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:22.700]   no matter what the future increase or decrease might be,
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.480]   you actually have, you still need it.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.000]   So even if the benefit, even if inflation doesn't go away
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.360]   so much, you still need the item.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.400]   And so you've got a guaranteed floor on your need,
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.040]   on your plan, that didn't come out quite as clearly
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.000]   as I was intending.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.120]   In essence, what I'm saying is that your downside
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:43.960]   is limited.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.720]   If you need socks and you calculate that I need a certain,
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.360]   you know, I need three pairs of socks every year,
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.760]   and you decide to buy five years worth of socks,
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.200]   you know that you're gonna need the socks,
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.160]   and you go ahead and buy them today,
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.680]   you can't possibly lose because you've gotten a fixed price
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.040]   for something that you need.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.320]   Now, even if socks go down in price,
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.640]   you still have the socks.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.040]   Gonna move on 'cause it's coming out in a clumsy way,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.600]   and I'm not able to articulate it better at the moment.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.800]   So this is what the Michigan, the state of Michigan
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.220]   tried to accomplish with their Michigan Education Trust.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:21.800]   What was unsure at that time was how
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.720]   the taxation would work.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.000]   There's an interesting court case,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   which I'll post a brief to in the show notes.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.160]   But this court case has, it was state of Michigan,
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.560]   it's Michigan Education Trust
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.460]   versus the United States of America.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:39.160]   And this court case has the details and the facts
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.080]   of the factual background of this trust fund.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.960]   So before actually opening the fund
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.040]   and accepting applications,
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.000]   the Michigan Education Trust did ask
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.720]   for a private letter ruling from the IRS
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.320]   as to whether the accrued investment income
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.760]   would be exempt from federal taxation.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.240]   It wasn't clear in the tax code at that time.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.220]   So the IRS issued a private letter ruling,
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.360]   and their decision in that private letter ruling
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.160]   was that the Michigan Education Trust
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.200]   was created as a corporation,
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   and that therefore its income
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.080]   was subject to federal taxation.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.360]   So the way it would have worked
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.600]   is that the purchasers of the contract
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.720]   were not going to be taxed on the accruing value
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.840]   of the contract until the funds were actually
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.280]   distributed to them or refunded to them
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.820]   if they didn't use them.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:38.280]   But that the trust fund would pay tax
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.360]   on the growth of the investments.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.100]   So they would pay annually the tax
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.460]   on the growth of the funds.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.560]   So the trust opened for business,
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.140]   and it worked exactly like that.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.360]   The individual signed up, about 55,000 people
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.940]   immediately signed up for the program,
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.080]   and the trust paid each year federal income tax
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.960]   on its investment earnings.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.600]   But in May of 1990, the trust sued the IRS
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.920]   seeking a refund of their payments.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   And they argued that the income was not,
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.840]   we should not have been subject to federal taxation,
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.100]   and they requested a refund of all of the tax payments
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.840]   plus interest from the time of date of inception
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.000]   up until the lawsuit.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.480]   And then in July of 1992,
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.720]   the district court found in favor of the IRS,
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.160]   said it was subject to federal taxation.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.200]   The trust appealed it, and then ultimately,
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.320]   the court actually reversed the district court's summary
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.540]   and found that the Michigan Education Trust
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.200]   was a state agency.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.560]   And as a state agency, as compared to a corporation,
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.840]   its investment income was not subject to federal taxation.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.680]   And ultimately, there was another lawsuit filed
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.960]   about the timing of the refund from the IRS,
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.360]   and ultimately, all the money was returned
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.960]   to the educational trust.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.840]   So this was fought in court.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.780]   Well, a lot of other states were watching this,
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.240]   and so Congress decided this is a pretty good idea.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.820]   And so they went ahead and clarified it
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.760]   by passing new legislation.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   And that new legislation became Section 529.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.560]   And this legislation authorized
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.340]   the qualified tuition programs,
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.520]   qualified state tuition programs.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.080]   And it was passed as part of
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.700]   And essentially, it allowed tax exemption
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:41.520]   to state-run programs if they qualified,
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.960]   and the tax deferral on the undistributed earnings
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.760]   from the account.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.960]   That fit into the,
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.380]   so that fit in, and Section 529 was passed as,
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.980]   also, excuse me, I'm not sure which part was in
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.620]   the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996,
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.220]   and then the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.420]   So the Clinton administration brought in
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.260]   Section 529 and the Taxpayer Relief Act.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.720]   And it made a number of other changes
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.140]   associated with education.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:16.620]   But one change is in that bill,
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.220]   there was a suggestion to make the distribution
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:23.660]   from 529 accounts tax-free, not simply tax-deferred.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.420]   Bill Clinton vetoed that.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.360]   So the way this worked at that time
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.360]   was that you put money into it,
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.960]   the investment earnings were tax-deferred
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:40.960]   until distribution, but at distribution, taxes were due.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.600]   So it was much like, for example,
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.920]   annuity taxation today is very similar.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.120]   You put it in, there's no deduction on the front end.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.660]   The money can grow, there's tax deferral
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.000]   all the way through as the money grows,
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.900]   and then at distribution, the tax is due.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:01.500]   The proposal was to make the growth completely tax-free.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.300]   Bill Clinton vetoed that.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:07.980]   In 2001, however, Congress passed the Economic Growth
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:11.960]   and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, known as EGTRA,
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.660]   and that was signed into law by President George W. Bush.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:20.660]   And what EGTRA did was it allowed all of the distributions
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:25.560]   from these accounts to be excluded from income
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.340]   when they were used for a qualified
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.560]   higher education expenses.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.020]   There were a number of other changes as well.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.860]   For example, this expanded the access
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.820]   for special needs beneficiaries.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:40.320]   It made these plans available for private institutions
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.060]   as well as public institutions,
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:44.460]   and there were some other changes as well.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.640]   But the primary one was it made these tax-free.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.300]   However, all of the proposals in that law
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.220]   were scheduled to sunset, and they were scheduled
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.780]   to sunset on December 31, 2010,
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.900]   and it was scheduled to revert back
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:04.900]   to how it was prior to that 2001 law.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:10.020]   In the Pension Protection Act of 2006,
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.900]   there was a provision that made all of those changes
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:17.900]   to Section 529 from EGTRA in 2001 permanent,
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.620]   including the tax-free treatment
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.260]   for qualified distributions.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.800]   So that's how it stands today.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.260]   Since that time, I mean, these plans have grown massively,
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.580]   and that's a huge difference as far as tax-free
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.180]   versus simply tax-deferred.
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.140]   And so these plans have grown massively,
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:39.000]   and they're very, very popular, very, very popular today.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.160]   Now, the challenge is that in the most recent
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.580]   budget proposal from President Obama,
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:48.820]   this is one of the proposals that is on the table,
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.560]   that he is proposing in his budget to change.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.720]   I personally had been waiting until
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.480]   the State of the Union address to review
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.880]   some of his recent proposals,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.320]   and I reviewed the transcript,
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.600]   and I didn't see anything about this,
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.080]   but then in researching it further after
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.680]   and with the help of a listener on the Facebook page,
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.280]   it was on my research list, but I just, I crowdsourced.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.080]   And I was able to dig some stuff out of the budget,
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   which they'd leak at a Friday night before a holiday weekend.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.160]   Nothing suspicious about that.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.360]   Political games.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.280]   Anyway, so the proposal is to go back to that 2001 number.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.320]   Here are the actual numbers of what happened, though,
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.760]   when that tax law changed,
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   is according to the College Savings Network,
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:44.560]   in 2001, assets in 529 plans were $13 billion.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.840]   In 2002, they doubled to $26 billion.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.120]   And presently, as things stand today,
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:58.240]   there are approximately $245 billion in these 529 plans.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:02.000]   Now, and then there's an average balance
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.040]   of about $21,000 in the plans
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.120]   with about 12 million accounts open.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.600]   Now, the interesting thing to me
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.720]   is just simply the proposals and the changes.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.800]   Now, certainly this is not law.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.440]   It has to go through a period of time.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.600]   If it does, we'll see.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.880]   Who knows what happens?
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.700]   But it's certainly not something that is,
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.140]   it's certainly not something that,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.680]   it's not out of the realm of possibility.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.000]   What I don't understand is why this is part
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   of Obama's agenda with all of the other focus on education.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.600]   You would think, I would think,
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.840]   that this would be a pretty safe one.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.280]   After all, he's trying to cut costs all over the place.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.320]   So I don't personally get why this is a part of his agenda.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:50.660]   I tried to research some of the liberal approaches to see,
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.960]   and the best I was able to find
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.120]   was Slate Magazine has an article.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.680]   The headline was "Obama Wants to Tax College Savings Accounts
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.520]   "and It's a Great Idea."
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.760]   And the author of this article is,
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.000]   cites data from the Government Accountability Office,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   which says that a majority of people who participate,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.720]   47% of families that participate in 529 plans
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.960]   are covered out educational savings accounts,
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   earn in excess of $150,000 a year.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.280]   I hate this cherry pick stuff.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   Of course they do, 'cause who else can afford
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.920]   to set aside money and is actually gonna take the time
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.000]   to plan for college accounts?
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.600]   Do you expect a single mom earning,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.780]   or a single dad earning $50,000 a year
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.820]   to have the excess cash flow to tuck aside 15,000 bucks
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.880]   in a 529 account?
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.800]   People don't plan, and there's no reason for it.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.160]   When there's tons of free money for college,
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.100]   why should you save for it?
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:50.400]   Anyway, I'm trying not to go into the politics of it,
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.520]   but it, I don't know,
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.240]   it doesn't make a lot of sense to me why that is.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.400]   But the biggest thing about it is,
[00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:00.340]   it's an illustration of how you have to be careful
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.640]   with these accounts.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.240]   And it,
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.880]   I try to stay out of the politics,
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.320]   but it is increasingly frustrating to me
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.760]   to have to deal with this stuff.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.880]   And it's always the same.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.720]   But if I could find another,
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   I think about sometimes
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.040]   of going to other tax jurisdictions,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.360]   if I could just make a law and keep it,
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.400]   and get rid of all the deductions,
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.280]   get rid of all the credits,
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.320]   get rid of all the accounts,
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.680]   and just pass a straight up tax of a certain amount
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.840]   and base it on income.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.720]   And then,
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.560]   whatever.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.080]   I don't, it's just, it's difficult to plan.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   'Cause how do I as a financial planner tell people,
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.040]   here's what you should do?
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.600]   If this goes back, there's not a chance in the world
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.680]   I would ever recommend a 529 plan again.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.520]   It's a waste of time.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.040]   And the reason it's a waste of time
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.320]   is because even just under this,
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.720]   under the Obama proposal,
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.520]   according to what I've read on it,
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.100]   I looked at the budget, but it was unclear,
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.720]   but he wants to go back,
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.400]   he wants to be taxed as ordinary income.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.320]   Well, in that situation,
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.840]   why would you ever put post-tax dollars in,
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.960]   defer it, and then pick up those dollars
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.800]   as ordinary income?
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.840]   It doesn't make any sense at all to me.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.040]   But welcome to our modern world.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.040]   And, (laughs)
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.000]   welcome to our modern world.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.300]   So that's a little bit of the history
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.800]   of the 529 plans.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.720]   Where things are gonna go,
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.040]   at the moment, the law is as it is.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.560]   Is Congress likely, are they ever likely to do anything?
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.400]   I don't think so.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.520]   The best thing that can happen at this stage is,
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.820]   and hopefully this will happen for the next two years,
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.300]   is you just have massive gridlock,
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.640]   and then Congress can do nothing
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.200]   and we can get on with our lives.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.720]   But we'll see, who knows?
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.100]   These things, you gotta keep an eye on it.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.260]   And again, you gotta do it in terms of scale.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.200]   Would I lock up my money for $100 a month
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.960]   and run the risk of that,
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.800]   and have the money tied up in this 529 account with that?
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.980]   There's not a chance in the world under this scenario.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:59.280]   Now, would I consider using this account
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.560]   as part of a comprehensive plan if I were more affluent?
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.440]   Might, I might.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.740]   That's my best shot at it.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.360]   Prior to this budget proposal,
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.100]   I was a much bigger fan,
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.240]   because when you can get a law that's set
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.840]   and it's not scheduled to sunset,
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.760]   that gives you some ability to plan.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.720]   But now these things are back on the table,
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.540]   it's certainly frustrating.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:26.200]   That is what I wanted to cover
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.800]   as far as the history and the introduction.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.520]   The next stage in my outline here
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.360]   is we're gonna go through the detailed rules,
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:35.840]   and so that you understand how these rules work.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.680]   And this is gonna answer
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.720]   what expenses can you pay, all of that.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.060]   This is actually where I stopped yesterday,
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.160]   but I'm gonna continue on
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.440]   since I didn't release the show yesterday.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.440]   I'm gonna cover here what the IRS publication 970,
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.080]   which is their publication on education,
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.400]   tax benefits for education, has to say about this.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.380]   And it's actually remarkably short.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.640]   In this publication, there's only four pages
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.440]   of information on the qualified tuition programs.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.080]   Of the actual legislation, if you wanna go and read it,
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:12.000]   it's remarkably short as the internal revenue code goes.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.520]   I've got it printed out here in my notes.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.160]   It's six pages, and a lot of it is double-spaced.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.960]   So there's not a lot to it.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.200]   The major challenge with 529 plans is the application,
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   and especially the nuance with state income tax deductions.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.520]   So let's boogie through just some big picture details,
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.280]   and then we'll get to the application in another show.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.320]   I've explained enough of the details
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.320]   that I don't need to go through all of them again.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:46.280]   But I do need to give you a few specific scenarios.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.760]   The first thing we need to do is define
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.880]   what are qualified education expenses.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.400]   So the money that comes out of these accounts
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.620]   comes out under current law tax-free
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.720]   if used for a qualified education expenses.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.020]   And here's the definition.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.960]   Qualified education expenses are expenses
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.320]   that are related to enrollment or attendance
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.780]   at an eligible education institution.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:19.520]   And for the purposes of a qualified tuition plan,
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.540]   this is an eligible educational institution.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:26.840]   Is any college, university, vocational school,
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.600]   or other post-secondary educational institution
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.580]   eligible to participate in a student aid program
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.080]   administered by the United States Department of Education?
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.860]   It includes virtually all accredited, public,
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.600]   non-profit, and proprietary,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.920]   meaning privately owned, profit-making,
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.960]   post-secondary institutions.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.560]   Now this is a very interesting definition
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.420]   because it brings up one of the unique wrinkles
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.400]   of a 529 plan.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.360]   And one of those wrinkles is how do we get out,
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.320]   how do we use the money?
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.820]   There is a method where you can actually
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.940]   use this money for yourself.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.980]   And you can use it for expenses that are associated
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.580]   at an eligible educational institution.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:14.300]   But that definition, which includes programs
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.620]   that are administered by the US,
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.020]   that accept student aid programs
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.260]   administered by the US Department of Education,
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.620]   opens up kind of a unique option.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.900]   This appeals to me and it might appeal to some of you
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.180]   who are interested in things like global travel,
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.020]   perpetual travel, that type of thing.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.560]   I knew about this potential loophole
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.040]   and I mentioned it on a previous show
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:37.040]   and then I realized I hadn't gone and looked up the list.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.880]   And so then a listener named Benjamin
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.320]   commented on a recent show where I had mentioned it,
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.200]   which was episode 118, where during a Q&A show,
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.320]   I talked about using a 529 account
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.840]   to go ahead and pay for tuition
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.600]   at a university in a foreign country.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.000]   And pay for tuition and room and board.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.680]   So this would be something that would appeal
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.480]   to somebody like me, is I love to learn
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.240]   and I would love to study at a foreign institution.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.200]   And so Benjamin found me the list of eligible schools
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.040]   that are eligible in other countries.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.560]   And there are tons of these.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.040]   So in Australia, there are 22 different universities.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.680]   Here's one in Austria, here's one in Bulgaria.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.560]   There are about a gazillion in Canada that are covered,
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.360]   well, gazillion is 71.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.360]   There's one in China, Costa Rica,
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.880]   five in Czech Republic, Denmark,
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.520]   three, Dominica, one, Dominican Republic, five,
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.700]   Egypt, one, England, a bunch.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.340]   So there's all these different universities,
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.360]   Oxford University, France, there are,
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   looks like a total of nine universities
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.900]   which are eligible for the US,
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.680]   for US federal financial aid.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.520]   So what that means is, remember in the previous
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.320]   Coverdell Educational Savings Account show,
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.880]   I talked about how easy it is to get the money
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.920]   out of the ESA and just put it into a 529.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.680]   With a 529 plan, there's no restriction on age.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.960]   So the money can sit here for a very long period of time.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.480]   And you can make yourself the beneficiary of it.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.760]   And I personally would thoroughly enjoy
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.520]   going and enrolling at the
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:23.640]   Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris in France,
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.480]   or the American University of Paris,
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.520]   or American Graduate School in Paris,
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.220]   and live and study in France,
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:34.600]   and use these tax-deferred 529 dollars
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.880]   to pay for my room and board,
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.960]   and I could find room and board on campus
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.920]   for me and my wife, and pay for our tuition
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.560]   to study at business school in Paris,
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.800]   or study at language school,
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.680]   or go to Israel, or Italy, or Lebanon.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.880]   All kinds of universities here.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.660]   And so this is a good way to think in advance
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.400]   about how do I use one of these tax-deferred accounts
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.640]   in a creative and unique way to fund
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.760]   what I'm trying to accomplish.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.580]   Now the key is the expenses.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.200]   What are the qualified expenses?
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.360]   Let me go through that.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.360]   Just like there was with the
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.520]   Coverdell Educational Savings Accounts,
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.240]   some of the expenses that are covered
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.080]   must be required by the institution,
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.000]   and then some of them must simply be
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.720]   incurred by the student.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.280]   So the expenses that must be required
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.180]   by the institution to be eligible
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.180]   as a qualified educational expense
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:31.020]   include tuition and fees, books, supplies, and equipment.
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:36.220]   So anything that's written on your syllabus
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.660]   for your college class that requires
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.540]   these specific books, these specific supplies,
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.240]   and this specific equipment,
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.140]   that's required and that's an eligible expense,
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.160]   and/or tuition and fees.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.320]   It's important because one of the things
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.420]   that people ask a lot of times
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.780]   is what are covered expenses?
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:59.660]   I had a recent question on a Friday Q&A show
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.500]   from a listener, and he was asking a question.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.660]   He'd gone to and outfitted his son,
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.900]   I think it was his son, at an apartment,
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.580]   and he bought an office chair for his son's apartment,
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.740]   and he asked is that an eligible expense?
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.300]   The answer is no.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.580]   Only supplies and equipment that are required
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.060]   by the eligible institution.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.540]   And because it's an off-campus apartment,
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:25.660]   then that's certainly not part of the expenses
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.600]   that are required by the university.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.680]   Now, if an office chair were included
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.320]   as part of the on-campus apartment,
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.560]   as part of the furnishing of an on-campus apartment,
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.720]   that would be covered, which we'll get to in just a second.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.600]   This is that little notice about special needs,
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.720]   and so these expenses are appropriate
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.680]   for special needs clients.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.440]   Expenses for special needs services,
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.800]   which are needed by a special needs beneficiary,
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.200]   must be incurred in connection with enrollment
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.560]   or attendance at an eligible educational institution.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   So the difference between required
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.520]   and connection is important.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.340]   So if you are or if you have a special needs beneficiary,
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:10.160]   any expenses that, for special needs services,
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.920]   that are incurred in connection with their enrollment
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.440]   or attendance at a university is eligible.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.640]   So that could be a little bit broader as an example.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.520]   In my mind, although you certainly cannot deduct
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.520]   commuting expenses, or you cannot pay for commuting expenses
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.560]   for a non-special needs student out of this account,
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.980]   because it's not required by the institution,
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:37.360]   I think that if there were special needs
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.520]   transportation services that were needed
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.140]   to get your special needs beneficiary
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.860]   from your house to that university,
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.680]   that would be an eligible expense.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.200]   So you can use a 529 account to allow you
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.720]   to purchase those services with tax-free dollars.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.240]   Now, as far as room and board, let me read you this.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.800]   Expenses for room and board must be incurred
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.720]   by students who are enrolled at least half-time.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.400]   The expense for room and board qualifies
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.720]   only to the extent that it is not more
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.960]   than the greater of the following two amounts.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.680]   The allowance for room and board,
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.480]   as determined by the eligible educational institution
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.280]   that was included in the cost of attendance
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.200]   for federal financial aid purposes
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.480]   for a particular academic period
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.320]   and living arrangement of the student.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.560]   Or B, the actual amount charged
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.880]   if the student is residing in housing owned or operated
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.960]   by the eligible educational institution.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.680]   So for a mainstream US student,
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.160]   what this says is A, to pay for room and board expenses
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.460]   out of this account, you need to be enrolled
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.800]   at least half-time, whatever the definition of half-time is
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.360]   for that university, at least half-time.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.840]   You can't be taking one class per semester
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.900]   and expect to pay for your room and board.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.320]   You could pay for the one class in tuition and fees
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   and book supplies and equipment out of this account,
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.280]   but you can't pay for room and board expenses
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.680]   with only one class.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.560]   But if you are at least half-time,
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.560]   then room and board is an allowable expense
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.560]   which can be paid for tax-free out of this account.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.120]   Well, up to how much?
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.440]   Well, it can be up to the amount that the student is paying
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.880]   if they're living in housing which is owned or operated
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.880]   by the college or university, no matter how much.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.280]   So there's no cap there.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.280]   Or if living off campus in other housing arrangements,
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.000]   then it can be as much as the institution includes
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.600]   in their cost of attendance for a particular academic period
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.800]   and living arrangement of the student.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.680]   So if the university calculates and says $10,000 per year
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.580]   is what we think a student will need to pay
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:49.160]   for accommodation, then a student can cover up to $10,000,
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.820]   excuse me, $10,000 per year is what we require
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.720]   and estimate for federal financial aid purposes
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.480]   as part of our costs.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.560]   Then the student in this scenario can live off campus
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.400]   and if their expenses are $12,000,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.960]   they can pay for up to $10,000
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.600]   as a qualified educational expense out of the 529 plan.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.260]   Now, I would imagine that for some of you,
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.880]   especially those of you who are involved
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.580]   in real estate investing, there might be some ideas
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.040]   going off in your head when thinking about that.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.760]   And for the rest of you, there are now.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.600]   So the fact that you can save money on a 529 account,
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.720]   grow that money tax-free,
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.200]   and then take the money out of the account
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.160]   and use it to pay for room and board expenses
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.440]   up to a certain amount, that's unique.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.220]   And there are some planning opportunities there
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.340]   for some of you.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:47.180]   So whether that just simply means your child,
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.340]   again, is living in an apartment,
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.340]   is just simply paying rent,
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:54.820]   as long as it falls underneath those amounts
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.900]   that are established by the institution,
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.740]   which the nice thing about that is
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.880]   that we're gonna be regionally based.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.540]   So if your child is paying rent in New York City
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.740]   or is paying rent in Biloxi,
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.380]   then there's a little bit of a difference there
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.380]   as far as what those costs are gonna be.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.200]   That's useful.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   Could you buy a house and have your child rent from you
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.080]   and pay for the rental cost out of the 529
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.280]   out of his or her 529 account?
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.120]   Yes.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.940]   You have to follow that through
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:29.600]   and do everything properly, but you can.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.600]   Can your child buy a house and pay for the expenses,
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.140]   pay for the mortgage and the interest costs
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.780]   and the taxes and the insurance out of the 529 account?
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.560]   Yes.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.520]   You have to follow the rules,
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.820]   but there are some planning opportunities here.
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:49.320]   You've gotta figure out what's worth it to you,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.700]   and here's where the challenge is
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.860]   with all of these kinds of ideas.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:54.920]   Sometimes an idea is pretty cool,
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.320]   and sometimes it's like, man, this is a total waste.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.600]   I like to think in terms of the ideal scenario.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.020]   So I like to think in terms of
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.240]   how could I use this account,
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.980]   tuck the money aside, okay, my child is enrolled,
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.000]   half time, at least half time,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.900]   and then they're gonna do that while they're,
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:14.480]   to go ahead and finish off the university degree
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.560]   or need for education,
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.440]   but they're doing it while they're building a business.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.400]   They're going to school half time
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.880]   while they're building a business on the side,
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:23.920]   and they're studying something
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.480]   that they're very interested in,
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.400]   and they're going ahead and using these 529 money,
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.120]   which has grown over time, tax-free,
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.400]   to pay for their mortgage and get them established
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.860]   with their first house,
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.080]   and that's a good way of transferring the money.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.680]   That can certainly work,
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.620]   and you can take it from here and go,
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.920]   maybe I'll come back and I'll talk about
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.760]   some more of these ideas.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.200]   I'm gonna do a whole show on some of the ways
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.320]   that you can essentially play with some of these systems,
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.680]   but hopefully that gives you enough of an idea,
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.420]   at least what the requirements are.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.920]   Tuition and fees, books, supplies,
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.540]   and equipment must be required.
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:01.100]   Special needs services just must be incurred in connection,
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.040]   and expenses for room and board,
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.760]   they have to be enrolled at least half time,
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.960]   and it can't be more than the greater
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.920]   of either the actual amount,
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.480]   if they're living in on-campus university housing,
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.720]   or what they use for their federal financial aid filings.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.860]   How much can you contribute?
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.920]   We've covered that already.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.080]   You can contribute from,
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.580]   you can contribute up to the,
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.120]   well, I need to give you more detail on this.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.900]   The contribution limits vary,
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.240]   depending on which type of plan you're participating in,
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.960]   whether you're using the plan that is for private colleges,
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.520]   or whether you are using a plan for public colleges,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.160]   whether you're using the savings plan.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.000]   In essence, though, the amount cannot be more
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.680]   than the amount necessary to provide
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.880]   for the qualified education expenses.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.160]   There are no income restrictions on who can contribute.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.600]   So if you make $2 million a year,
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.280]   you can contribute to this account,
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.080]   but you cannot be more than what is needed
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.340]   for each beneficiary.
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:02.640]   So if you only have one beneficiary,
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.080]   don't put $3 million into this account.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.040]   That's not gonna work.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.120]   But you can add multiple beneficiaries,
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.720]   and you can change the beneficiaries along the way.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.280]   Losses.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.960]   If you do have a loss in a qualified tuition program account,
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.380]   yes, you can take the loss on your income tax return.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.080]   After all of the money has been distributed
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.460]   from the account, if you have a loss,
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:26.000]   then you can go ahead and take that.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.260]   Now, the IRS says in publication 970
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:33.580]   that this comes in as a miscellaneous itemized deduction
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.760]   on Schedule A, and this is subject to the 2%
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.120]   of adjusted gross income limit.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.340]   That's what they say.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:44.260]   That is less advantageous than simply an ordinary loss.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.560]   Now, interestingly, even though the IRS publication says
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.660]   this is where you can claim it,
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.380]   from my research, this indicates
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:55.080]   that there are some tax experts who disagree,
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.620]   and based upon studying the code,
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:00.140]   say that you can take it as an ordinary loss.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.200]   But to the best of my knowledge,
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.820]   this has not yet been litigated.
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.420]   So if or when it is litigated,
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.540]   that would be important to know,
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.900]   I guess, before the tax court and see what the decision is.
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.100]   But if any of you are aware of any additional information
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.240]   on that, feel free to comment on today's show notes
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.080]   and let me know.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.420]   But at least the point is, you can take losses.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.860]   Distributions.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.680]   The interesting thing about this account
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.700]   is there are a couple different things you gotta calculate,
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.620]   whether or not the distributions are taxable.
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.020]   And there's a difference between taxable distributions
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.660]   and penalized distributions.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.140]   So let's talk about whether the distribution
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.660]   is taxable or not.
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:37.180]   In essence, when you boil the rules down,
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:41.380]   if you have a distribution from the account
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.740]   that exceeds the adjusted qualified education expenses,
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:47.100]   it will probably be taxable.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:51.700]   Now, the challenge is that the adjusted education,
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.180]   excuse me, the adjusted qualified educational expenses
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:59.380]   number is the total qualified education expenses
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.240]   which have been reduced by any tax-free
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.260]   educational assistance,
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.860]   including any tax-free scholarships or fellowships,
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:11.700]   any veterans educational assistance, any Pell Grants,
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.420]   any employer-provided educational assistance,
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:17.420]   or any other non-taxable payments
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.020]   other than gifts or inheritances
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.100]   that have been received as educational assistance.
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.120]   So you've gotta work out and see
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.700]   is there a taxable distribution
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.300]   or a non-taxable distribution.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.120]   As part of that planning,
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.740]   you've gotta look at also how to coordinate the expenses,
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.680]   the qualified educational expenses,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.260]   with other tax credits that you may be taking.
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.100]   So you might be coordinating this
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.040]   with Coverdell Educational Savings Account distributions
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.060]   or coordinating it with American Opportunity
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.340]   and Lifetime Learning Credit distributions.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.500]   And you'll find out if some of the distributions
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.080]   are taxable or not.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.860]   It's possible to have a taxable distribution
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.220]   that does not also have a 10% additional penalty tax.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.260]   But in general though,
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.260]   you're usually going to have a 10% additional tax
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:07.660]   if the funds aren't used for education.
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.760]   So this is one of the key points.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.020]   We're getting a little nitpicky here
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:13.060]   and I'm not gonna go any deeper than that on the audio.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.340]   If you have a specific planning scenario
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:16.660]   that you're trying to figure out,
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.220]   look at it with your own set of facts,
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:19.320]   with the actual numbers,
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.080]   and then refer to the IRS guidance documents
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.240]   and look at it with your own scenario.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.020]   The 10% additional tax, however,
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.540]   does have some exceptions.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:36.580]   And so you don't have the additional 10% penalty tax
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.980]   for a distribution which is paid to the beneficiary
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.380]   or to the estate of the designated beneficiary
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:45.180]   on or after the death of the designated beneficiary.
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.300]   So the example here would be
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:51.940]   if I'm the beneficiary of an account and then I die
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:55.220]   and that money then is paid to my estate,
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:57.900]   it would indeed be a taxable event,
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.760]   but it would not have the 10% additional penalty tax.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.260]   The next exception is any payments that are made
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:07.380]   because the designated beneficiary is disabled.
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:08.440]   So if it's disabled,
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.780]   the payments can be made without the additional tax,
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.460]   the 10% penalty.
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:15.600]   Additionally, the penalty tax does not apply
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.120]   to payments that are included in income
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.220]   because the beneficiary received
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.500]   a tax-free scholarship or fellowship,
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.380]   veterans educational assistance,
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.780]   employer-provided educational assistance,
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:29.460]   or any other non-taxable tax-free payments
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:30.800]   other than gifts or inheritances
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.980]   which are received as educational assistance.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.500]   This is useful because it means that if you oversave
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.060]   for your child's college expenses
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:44.220]   or your child gets scholarship income, something like that,
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.740]   when the money is distributed,
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.460]   as long as the numbers of the expenses work out
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:51.000]   and the scholarship income, you follow the rules.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.960]   But basically, whatever distributions that are made
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.660]   because they received a tax-free scholarship or fellowship,
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.260]   those distributions will not be subject to the penalty tax.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:04.020]   You will owe income tax, but not the penalty tax.
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:05.180]   So that's helpful.
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:06.540]   Then the fourth and fifth exceptions
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.700]   is any distribution that's made on account
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.820]   of the attendance of the designated beneficiary
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.980]   at a US military academy,
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:16.940]   and then also any distributions that are included in income
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.140]   only because the qualified education expenses
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.460]   were taken into account
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.140]   in determining the American Opportunity
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.800]   or Lifetime Learning Credit.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:25.300]   So it gets a little bit too tricky
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:28.500]   to try to explain in an audio format.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.460]   But in essence, there are some ways
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.280]   to take some distributions from the account
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.700]   where you will owe tax on them,
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:36.400]   but you won't owe the penalty tax.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.280]   In general, you don't wanna over-save into this account,
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:43.120]   but there are some exit plans
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.680]   as I have sketched out for you.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.320]   What if you do over-save?
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.960]   Well, one of the most useful things
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.240]   is that you can simply change and roll over the account
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.880]   from one person to another.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.760]   So you can change the beneficiary on the account.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.320]   And the people that you can change this to,
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.700]   the number of people is quite broad.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.660]   This is the most useful exit point.
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:09.020]   If your oldest child doesn't use the funds,
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:10.540]   you can just simply transition the funds
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.480]   to your next child and along the way.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.120]   And so any kind of rollovers, there's no tax implications,
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.920]   the money continues to be sheltered
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.600]   and it can be passed along.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.360]   Here are the people to whom it can be passed
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:27.920]   to these members of the beneficiary's family.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.280]   And so for the purposes of this rollover,
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:34.520]   the beneficiary's family includes the beneficiary's spouse
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:39.160]   and the following other relatives of the beneficiary.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:45.280]   Son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, adopted child,
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:51.020]   or a descendant of any of them.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.840]   So we now said any descendant of the beneficiary.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.120]   So if that's you, any of your descendants,
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.200]   if it's your child, any of your child's descendants,
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.740]   any descendant of any of their descendants.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.340]   The brother, sister, stepbrother,
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.660]   or stepsister of the beneficiary.
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:15.340]   Father or mother or ancestor of either.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.220]   Stepfather or stepmother.
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.700]   So on the father, mother, stepfather,
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.620]   the father, mother, or ancestor of either.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.500]   What that means is that if you set something aside
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:28.540]   for your child and you don't use the funds
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.500]   for their education, you can change the beneficiary
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.560]   to be you and you can do my retirement plan
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.460]   of getting a PhD in Paris out of the 529 accounts.
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:44.640]   Any ancestor or even to your child's grandparent
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.840]   if they want to go back to school.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.440]   Stepfather or stepmother.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.200]   So it doesn't say ancestor of stepfather or stepmother,
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.920]   just stepfather or stepmother.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.760]   Son or daughter of a brother or sister.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.760]   So if your child doesn't use the funds
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.160]   but your child's brother has a son or daughter
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.220]   and they want it to go to them, that's allowable.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:10.540]   Brother or sister of father or mother.
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:15.560]   So meaning if your child is the beneficiary
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.440]   but you're their father or mother,
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.460]   your brother or sister is an allowable change.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:28.360]   Son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law,
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.320]   mother-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.980]   of the designated beneficiary.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:39.840]   The spouse of any individual listed above or first cousins.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.480]   And that's the list.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.360]   So that's a fairly comprehensive list.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.960]   So if there are in essence educational needs
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.920]   anywhere in your family, then this account
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.520]   can be used to fund those needs.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:54.120]   That's the essence of how the accounts work.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.480]   Now there are a number of specific detailed questions
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.560]   of implementation.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.840]   And with 529 accounts, the key is not in
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.280]   how does the account work, the key,
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.400]   although that is a factor.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.420]   The key is in the application of it.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:12.800]   How do you know, as an example, if your state
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.720]   has a prepaid tuition program that is financially viable
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.800]   and financially solvent?
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.160]   How do you select among, after all,
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.720]   the only 529 plans you can participate in
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.600]   are the ones that are sponsored by a specific state.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.480]   So how do you choose among different state options?
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.360]   How would you know whether Virginia's plan
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.520]   is better than Florida's plan,
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.280]   is better than Alabama's plan?
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.160]   How do you calculate the fees?
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.140]   And then one of the big ones is
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.180]   what about the state income tax deduction?
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:45.880]   Because this might be a compelling reason
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.920]   for you to participate in a 529,
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.440]   and it might be a total waste of time.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.520]   For me in Florida, we don't have state income taxes,
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.520]   it's a total waste of time, don't even think about it.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.480]   But for some of you, this could be very useful to you.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.080]   So we will cover those in future shows.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.280]   I hope that was a useful intro to you,
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.640]   I kind of did a double header here
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.360]   with putting those information together,
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.120]   but I feel better about the flow of the show
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.960]   and my ability to convey the important points.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.360]   I know I got a little bogged down there
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.240]   in the middle with the political planning,
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.480]   but it is actually an important part of financial planning.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.560]   In, when you're talking about risk for a portfolio,
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.520]   one of the major mistakes that many new investors make
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.960]   is they only think of risk on a one dimensional basis.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.320]   You know, the risk of market risk, for example.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.280]   You know, the value of their investments going up or down.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.800]   But there are many kinds of risk,
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.560]   and one of those, one type of risk is tax risk,
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.320]   so a change in the tax code.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.000]   Another type of risk is political risk,
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.320]   a change in the political climate of an environment.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.280]   What do you do if you own an oil company,
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.800]   and you own stock of this oil company,
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.400]   and that company goes through a socialist revolution,
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.600]   and the government comes in
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.000]   and completely nationalizes the country?
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.400]   Excuse me, the company?
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.360]   It's happened, it's happened many times.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.240]   So that's a risk.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.160]   And so in personal financial planning,
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.400]   when you choose to participate
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.480]   in things like a 529 account, you have a risk.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.160]   President Obama, in cahoots with Congress,
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.120]   might change the law, and you might find yourself
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.960]   not sitting on a tax-free asset that you were planning on,
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.280]   you might find yourself sitting on
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.080]   merely a tax-deferred asset.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.960]   Or, previously, you might have gotten in,
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.800]   and it might have gotten better,
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.640]   you might have gotten in under the tax-deferred plan,
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.000]   and found out that it was just a tax-free plan.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.720]   So join us for part two, and I'll start to go through
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.600]   how to make these actual decisions to your own,
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.480]   in your own scenario, and try to figure out
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.840]   what plans should I participate in, what state,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.920]   okay, if I'm in this state,
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.560]   then how do I make these decisions?
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.840]   How do these assets account for, you know,
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.240]   other aspects of my planning?
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.280]   Asset, I haven't talked about asset protection,
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.120]   I haven't talked about estate planning,
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.860]   so there's much more to this series,
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:51.320]   but we're gonna continue this masterclass on investments.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.680]   Thank you so much for being with me today,

[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:13.660]   your specific goals, and provide specific answers
