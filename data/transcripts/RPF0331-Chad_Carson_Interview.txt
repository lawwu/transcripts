[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.560]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.600]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.880]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.360]   Today my guest is Chad Carson, aka Coach Carson.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.440]   He's a real estate investor and financial freedom advocate.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.000]   And Chad, early retiree, is that the case?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We're almost there.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.280]   It depends on how you define it.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.760]   But I feel pretty good about my life right now.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760]   I'll say that.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   Awesome.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   Well, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.280]   How do you define it?
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.200]   Well, I've been working on that for about 13 years and it's one of the reasons I got
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.760]   interested in your website and looking at it because I know you kind of pick apart the
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.440]   same thing about these different stages of financial independence.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.480]   And I've sort of come to that the best definition I can give is that I'm climbing a mountain
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.800]   and at the very peak of the mountain is this idea that I'm going to have a large number
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.920]   of assets and those assets pretty easily produce passive income that pays for my lifestyle.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.560]   And that's sort of the general big picture.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.120]   But what I found for myself along the way is that I've hit a lot of plateaus during
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.120]   that climb.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.800]   And some of those plateaus have been, you know, I might not have 100 percent of the
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.320]   income I need, but I have half of it or I have three quarters of it or I have a lot
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.280]   of money in the bank and I can take many retirement for a year or six months.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.500]   And so I guess I've sort of had a hard time defining it because I've enjoyed the process
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.080]   a lot as well.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.640]   And I think I'm getting closer and closer to the peak and the actual definition I want.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.720]   But it's been fun along the way too.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   So tell us your journey.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.960]   Where did you start with working toward building financial independence?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.880]   Did you come from a privileged background or where did you start?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.760]   I did hit the ovarian lottery, as Warren Buffett likes to say.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   I didn't have a bunch of money given to me, but I had good parents who were very supportive
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.200]   and I played football.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.520]   And so I got a college scholarship to play football at Clemson University.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   And so that pretty much paid for my school and I got a school education for free.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.680]   I didn't have any debt when I got out.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.000]   And so in that respect, I had a clean slate when I started.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.800]   And sort of the fork in the road for me after college, I was a science major, biology.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   And I thought about teaching.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.560]   I thought about medical school.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.840]   I also thought about going some, you know, working for some Wall Street companies and
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.200]   kind of go the business route.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.800]   But for me, the allure was always entrepreneurship and starting my own thing.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.840]   And so I got into the real estate entrepreneurship path, just sort of on a whim out of college.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.800]   And I had to own my car and I had a thousand bucks in the bank and I just had to figure
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   it out and scrap by.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.440]   And that's sort of been my story for the last 13 years.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.800]   Being an entrepreneur, trying to make a living as a real estate investor, but then also building
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.600]   wealth and working towards that financial independence that we were talking about.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.640]   Were you surfing late night cable TV and came across Carlton Sheets, his program?
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.640]   Something like that.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   Where did you get the idea?
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.160]   Well, see, another reason I was fortunate is my father had rental properties growing
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   up.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.240]   And so he had some books on the shelf and I would, you know, I was perusing the books
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.240]   on a shelf during a break in college and noticed one of them.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.920]   It was actually a Mark Haraldson book.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.400]   I don't know if he's kind of an old school guy from the 70s or 80s.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.320]   And it was one of those just super catchy overdone titles, you know, like, you know,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.280]   retire and this many years.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.560]   And I said, oh, wow, that sounds great.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.680]   I hadn't started working, but I really would like to retire.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.280]   And so I started reading it.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.400]   But the good thing was I had all these books on the shelf.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.600]   It was like a library that I could just absorb.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.440]   And I'm a learner and I love to pick it up.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.600]   And so I started reading and it really planted the bug in me because I'd seen my dad work
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   in it.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.280]   And I never liked real estate growing up because he used to make us, you know, make us during
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.000]   the summer go clean out some of these foreclosure houses that he bought.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.120]   And in the Georgia summers, Atlanta would be 90 degrees and there would be, you know,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.240]   old deer meat in the freezer of these refrigerators that I'm cleaning out.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.880]   And I said, this is horrible.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.520]   And who in the world would ever, I don't know why you would do this.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.920]   And of course, when you get out of college and you start thinking about potential, you
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.760]   said, wait a minute, dad was actually pretty smart guy.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.920]   And so I saw for a year I apprenticed under him and I was a bird dog where I just I said,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.120]   you know, dad, I've read in the book that there are these things called bird dogs where
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.840]   I could basically find an experienced investor deals by hustling and going out, knocking
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.920]   on doors and sending letters.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.840]   And so he told me a definition of the type of deals he was looking for, the locations
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.120]   he was looking for.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.600]   And I hustled and went out there and found them during that first year and bought deals.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.340]   And I made a little bit of a markup on every deal that I bought him.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.340]   And that got me started.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.360]   That was sort of went from there.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.920]   So I want to talk about that start.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.440]   But before we do that, do you have kids now?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   I do.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.920]   Yeah, I have a three year old and a five year old.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.200]   Do you make them go out and rake the leaves in one of your rental properties?
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.800]   Do you anticipate putting them through the same thing your dad did to you?
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.160]   I'm so thankful to my wife because they're so much more helpful than I was as a kid.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.040]   I said that this could not be my genes because I was complaining the entire time.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.000]   And my kids are like, dad, can I help you?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Can I help you?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So I think we'll we won't get to the deer meat in the freezer yet, but I think I'll
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.840]   let them pick up trash at the rental properties when we go on the construction site or something.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.360]   I think that'll be the first step.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.240]   It is like we joke about it, but for me, it's actually one of my primary motivators
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.280]   for investing in real estate is because it can be a really good family business and can
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.120]   provide you with a lot of ways to give your kids opportunities for meaningful work while
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.160]   exposing them to the process of investment.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.880]   And that's a benefit that many parents, if they don't have their own business or if
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.840]   they don't have something like real estate, it's tough to find work for your kids to
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   do.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.320]   But if you can put them to work and, hey, we're going to clean out this property, going
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.160]   to go clean it up, you can have hard work that's safe and still teaches them the lessons.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.080]   So I think it's a huge benefit of real estate.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   Absolutely.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   Myself.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.280]   And you could use one of those tricks where you can have a 10-year-old making a couple
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.320]   thousand bucks during the summer and putting their money in or off IRA, right?
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   Absolutely.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.480]   It's one of the fun avenues you could take with that.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's without question one of the things that people should do.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Bird dogging.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.240]   Explain what – so I feel like this is a really good way for people to get into real
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.680]   estate and since you've actually did it this way, explain what a bird dog is and how
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.080]   somebody who's interested in pursuing your path might go about doing what you did.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   Okay.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.040]   Well, I mean a non-technical definition of a bird dog is for those who aren't in the
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   south and do hunting.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.040]   I grew up in the south and so bird dog is a little more intuitive.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.520]   A bird dog in hunting would go point out where the birds are in the bushes and the hunter
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.280]   would then go catch the birds or shoot the birds.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.880]   And so that's essentially what you do.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.320]   What I did as a bird dog was I would sniff out those deals and sometimes that would involve
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.560]   – one of my core ways that I've always done and still do to this day is just riding
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.320]   neighborhoods and looking for vacant houses.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.840]   And so I could literally, "Hey, there's some grass really tall in that house," and
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.880]   I would go to start sniffing around and knock on the door.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   "All right.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   There's nobody there.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.200]   I'm going to knock on the neighbor's door, talk to the neighbors.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.280]   Hey, I'm interested in buying this house.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.080]   Do you know who I can talk to about buying it?"
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.800]   And just start asking questions and getting involved.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   And I would start doing that.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.720]   I'd start talking to realtors.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.640]   I would send out some letters to different kind of marketing campaigns.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.720]   And the point being though that a bird dog is sort of on the front end of the acquisitions
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.080]   funnel of buying these products of real estate.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.520]   And the benefit for a brand new person who's willing to hustle and who's got some courage
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   to go knock on doors and talk to people is that you don't have to know all of the rest
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.960]   of the funnel of real estate.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.680]   You don't have to necessarily have to know how to raise the money.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.440]   You don't have to know how to do all the negotiations.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   You don't have to know how to even analyze 100% of the deal.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.880]   You need to recognize some factors of what's a good deal and what's not.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.480]   But a bird dog is basically just pointing the bird out and then they bring in the big
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   dog.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.720]   They bring in the investor who has the capital and the knowledge and the experience.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.000]   And that person actually knocks the deal down and gets it.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.120]   And you have some sort of arrangement.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.000]   Either if you're a licensed realtor, you can make a referral fee, a finder's fee.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.160]   If you're not, maybe you can figure out a way to get on the salary for that investor
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.800]   or find some other way, legal way to do that and make a small cut.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.160]   My cut was $2,000 for every deal that I brought the investor.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.240]   And for that investor, that could be a very good investment because they're getting a
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.520]   deal they might make $30,000 on or have a lot of cash flow for many years.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   So that's a reasonable fee to pay.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.840]   And so to just identify it from my perspective – and by the way, Chad, if you disagree
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.920]   with anything I say, please add your own perspective.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.440]   You're the one who's actually actively engaged in this business.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.600]   I'm a newcomer to the business.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   But one of the major benefits just to point out here is a core skill of real estate investment
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.640]   is finding deals.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.600]   But early in your career, as you explained there, fresh out of college, no money in the
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.920]   bank, it can be tough to have the money necessary or valuable to put together deals.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.660]   And so you can – by working as a bird dog, going out and finding deals for other investors,
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:11.200]   you can hone and develop the skills of finding deals and then you can get paid for that work.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.520]   And the investors down the road, you always face this tradeoff of time and money.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.480]   Young people usually have lots of time and not much money.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.560]   Older people usually have a decent amount of money and a lot less time.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.940]   So if you can bring a good deal or a fair deal to an investor who's got the capital
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.280]   to expend and they can do that without them – without it requiring them to have a lot
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.560]   of time off driving around neighborhoods looking for empty houses when they could have more
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.160]   productive uses of their time, you're performing a very valuable service, building skills that
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.920]   are important, putting together capital, putting together deals, gaining experience and getting
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.760]   paid for it all the way through.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.200]   So it is a way that somebody who literally you have no job, you just have a little bit
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.080]   of knowledge, you meet an investor or some investors, find out what they're looking
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.720]   for and you go out and find them deals, you can create a business for yourself starting
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720]   from scratch.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   I mean you nailed it.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   You nailed the benefits.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.520]   I'll give some caveats to this whole strategy because I think this idea of bird dogging
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.200]   and some people in the late night infomercials might call it – there's a business called
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.360]   wholesaling within real estate and I think it's a really good idea for a beginner.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.400]   For me particularly, the reasons that I thought it was an awesome idea was I was lacking in
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.920]   knowledge, I was lacking in money and so if I looked at my personal balance sheet, I had
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   some liabilities there.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.080]   I had a very small bank account of wisdom and experience and money but what I did have
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.320]   like you said is I had a lot of time, enthusiasm, I'm a quick learner and so I had to go
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.160]   with the strengths that I had and I was willing to communicate.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.800]   So on the flip side of that though, a lot of people are sold that they need to get started
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.400]   with bird dogging or wholesaling but really it's a particular skill set that a person
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.600]   who's a good bird dog has.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.960]   So a lot of people who have never been in a sales job in their life or they don't have
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:03.000]   a lot of time or they look at their own personal balance sheet and they don't have those skills,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.720]   then there's a lot of other ways to get started in real estate and it happened to be a good
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:13.040]   one for me but I think often that way of getting started is oversold a little bit because it
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.120]   has so many benefits because you're learning one of the key strategies of real estate is
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.480]   you have to find the deals and that's one of the bottlenecks for so many investors.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.360]   So it's a really valuable skill to do and I really built up during that year that I
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.000]   worked and with bird dog, I did make some money.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I made $24,000 in one year which fresh out of college is not screaming but I could have
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.160]   done better in some of the other avenues that I was thinking about but the balance sheet,
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.640]   my personal balance sheet of skill sets grew enormously and my confidence and by the end
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.040]   of that 12 months, I made my father happy and he bought deals and I went on my own way
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.520]   and those skills that I had personally, I could then say, "You know what?
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   I know how to find deals.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.920]   I'm very confident in that.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.560]   I have systems that work.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.640]   Now what's the next step up as a business model?"
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.520]   And for me, I went into business with a business partner up in Clemson, South Carolina.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.240]   I moved up the road there and the next step was to find people with money to partner with
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.080]   me instead of me just giving them the whole deal.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:19.320]   So if I could go for example and find a person who had $100,000 and it was an investor who
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.420]   trusted me and was willing to work with me, it made sense for that investor to split the
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:30.160]   deal with me and so instead of making $2,000, if it's a $20,000 deal, now I'm making $10,000
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.240]   and that was sort of – so that skill set I learned in the first year built naturally
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.320]   to the next level where I could make more money on every deal using that same skill
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.840]   that I built for the first time.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:47.080]   So to clarify, how long now have you been – how many years ago was that when you graduated
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080]   from college?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   2002.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.520]   I'm doing the math backwards but I think it's about 13 years.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.880]   So looking back about 13, 14 years, you have been engaged full time in real estate during
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.440]   the course of your career thus far?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.680]   It's my everyday business and I've taken breaks here and there but this is the way
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.880]   I put food on the table for 13, 14 years.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.800]   But you have not gone and worked a job, something like that to create capital for yourself.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.120]   You've figured out how to build capital while staying involved in the real estate
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.120]   business.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.120]   Is that right?
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   Exactly.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   I have a kind of parallel universe.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.200]   I've been raising capital, making money as a real estate investor, buying and flipping
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.760]   houses, assigning deals to other people and then I've also bought rental properties
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.040]   and held long term capital assets in addition to that.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.680]   So explain to my audience how you've done this and the reason I wanted to set those
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.640]   parameters is this is one of the challenges.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.260]   There are many ways to invest in real estate.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.260]   Real estate is not magic.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.960]   It's just an asset class that has unique characteristics but it does have some real
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.600]   benefits for wealth building and wealth creation and many people have built major fortunes
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.960]   through investing in real estate.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.920]   And if I have a listener who let's say is working a corporate job and just simply purchases
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.520]   a house here and there on the side, they have some certain advantages.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.840]   They're relatively financeable.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.680]   They've got stable income.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.960]   They have something steady to fall back on.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.480]   Perhaps they have a high savings rate so they can cash flow the properties, etc.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.040]   You've taken kind of the cowboy approach though of actually figuring out how to make your
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.320]   deals where you didn't have any capital in the beginning.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.600]   The whole way along, your business has needed to give you a place to live, put food on the
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.760]   table and find and fund investment opportunities.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:36.120]   So how did you practically tactically do this starting with nothing and building up the
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.680]   portfolio that you've accumulated?
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.360]   How do you do it when you don't have any money?
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.960]   Yeah, good question.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.140]   I think there's a couple major kind of factors that played in my favor.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.520]   Some of them I wasn't aware of up front.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.680]   I think I got lucky a little bit and maybe had some good advice from people.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.560]   But one of the things was non-real estate related and I think it's something just personal
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.160]   finance related was that I've been fairly frugal.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   And so when you start out at college, I basically would have lived in the back of my car if
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.840]   I had to make this thing work.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.320]   But I never got to the big lifestyle.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.120]   My money came in chunks.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.200]   My first year of business, I didn't make any money until the second six months.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.680]   My second year in business, the same thing happened again.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.520]   I didn't make any money until the second six months.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.920]   So I got used to really early on having to live lean.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.760]   And so during the times when I wasn't making any money, you just eat ramen noodles and
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.720]   you deal with what you got to deal with.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.440]   But then you make a lot of money and it comes in and you set that money aside and don't
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.160]   necessarily spend it because you know there might be another lean period.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.840]   So I think that habit is that personal habit of living frugally.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   Living frugally has been helpful because there's been so many ups and downs.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.720]   I started in an up market and a kind of rising market 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and really had
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.160]   my growth period during those times.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:03.300]   And so that frugality and the ability to go back to your roots was very helpful.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.840]   But the second part of it, I think, and this is the part that maybe was a little bit fortunate,
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.080]   was because I was not bankable, because I had good credit but I didn't have a job, a
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.800]   W-2 income that I could go to the banks and borrow a lot of money.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.400]   It was sort of a blessing in disguise because, as I told you, the first year I had to learn
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.880]   how to work with other investors to put my deals together.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.320]   And so my natural evolution was to start going to individuals and asking them if they would
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.120]   put up the money for my deals.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.520]   But partly because I just felt like that's what we had to do because I wasn't confident
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.280]   going to the banks and asking for a whole lot of loans, although we could get a couple,
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.760]   one or two loans with a local bank.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.860]   So the strategy we used, we had to get really creative with our deal structuring.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.500]   And so that was good long run because most of our deals, if we had, when we started holding
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.980]   deals and holding rental properties, instead of owing money to a commercial bank that had
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:03.240]   a three-year balloon or a five-year balloon, we had loans with private investors or we
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:09.560]   had lease options with sellers or we had seller financing where the terms were with the seller
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.000]   instead of with the bank.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.800]   And so we were able to negotiate really favorable terms on our financing.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.340]   And more than anything, though, we were able to have partners on our deals who, when things
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:26.320]   got bad, 2007, '08, instead of us having to go refinance a lot of loans at the worst time,
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.680]   we were able to sort of weather the storm.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.720]   And even though we had a good bit of leverage, I mean, we started with very little capital.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.900]   And so we obviously had a lot of leverage.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.440]   The kind of leverage we had was a little bit different than the traditional leverage you
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   would look at.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   We had lower terms.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   We had lower interest rates.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.400]   We had private individuals who we could sit down at the table and talk to and say, "Here's
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   the situation.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   Here's what we're doing."
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.440]   And so that's my second thing is that I think growing from where we did from scratch and
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.520]   not having a lot of capital to finally building some capital, in real estate, it's so cyclical
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.960]   up and down and the market's going to change.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.560]   The financing is such a critical piece of it.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   And you have to be as worried about the financing and the terms of your financing and who you're
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.760]   financing it from as you are the real estate deal you're putting together.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.640]   I'd like you to expand on what it was actually like during those years, maybe talk about
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.080]   a couple of deals because I've mentioned this on the show and I've had John Schaub on the
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.720]   show and I know you're a student of Schaub's, at least you've read his books.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.640]   He emphasizes extensively why he prefers not financing with banks.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.880]   And one of the major reasons is safety in difficult times where if you wind up in a
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.900]   difficult period and you need to sit down and work on something, you're much safer as
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:43.640]   an investor having your financing with other investors, other individuals because you have
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   more options.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.360]   But that's not generally intuitive to many people.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.080]   So explain what it was actually like during those years, describe some deals and what
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.640]   you had to do and why what you just said is true.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   Okay, sure.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.440]   Yeah, I can remember one specific time.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.080]   So 2007 was a very interesting year for us for a couple of reasons.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.320]   One is we grew a lot.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.600]   We had 48 closings in one year.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.800]   So we acquired 48, you had 48 times we went to a closing where we were buying property
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.120]   and some of those were multiple properties.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.160]   Well, the theme was at the end of that year, we did well on a lot of deals, but we had
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.240]   enough, a handful of deals that were not as good and we kind of bit off more than we could
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   chew.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.880]   And it was at a point where the storm clouds were kind of forming on the horizon.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.960]   You could see things happening, the market's kind of softening up.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.280]   And so at one of those points when we bit off more than we can chew, we had a deal that
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.920]   we basically needed some extra capital on.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.640]   We underestimated the amount of rehab that we'd have to do.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.680]   That happens all the time, by the way, it seems like.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.360]   Even experienced investors underestimate how much it's really going to take to fix up these
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.920]   properties.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.040]   And so we're short some money and how are we going to do this deal?
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.960]   You don't want to be stuck in an in-between point where you can't get it sold or you can't
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.400]   get it rented.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.160]   And so you need that capital.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   And so we went to a person who had one of our early investors and said, here's the situation,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.060]   we need some capital.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.520]   And we basically looked at some of our other properties and cross-collateralized.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:21.160]   So basically, it took five properties and said, we have first mortgages on those properties.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.400]   And would you be willing to loan a second mortgage on this property?
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.800]   If we had walked into a bank and asked them to do that, I mean, there's no chance.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.680]   They're not going to go in second position because that means if we go bankrupt, if something
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.320]   happens to us, they're going to lose.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.400]   But this private investor, he liked us, he trusted us, but it had to be more than that.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.320]   He had to feel like, I'm putting up money.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.160]   If you get run over by a bus, I don't want to lose my money.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.720]   And so we put him in the types of situations where we said, if we have to, we'll de-do
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   the property.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.760]   We will give you, here's an appraisal on the property, it's worth $200,000.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.400]   You're loaning us up to $120,000.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.860]   So the point is, we looked at each property.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:09.480]   And he as an investor, as a savvy investor, was able to see that his risk was a reasonable
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   risk.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.900]   And he made the loan and got us through that.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.720]   And so we paid him back off after we sold a couple properties.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.120]   So I guess the point of that, that's one particular story, is that you have a private lender can
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.320]   sometimes look outside the box a little bit and think about the deal and look really at
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.480]   the collateral.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.400]   Because the collateral to me, even this day, if I'm going to loan somebody money, I want
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.020]   to know that they'll perform.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.360]   But as a real estate investor, my number one rule if I'm loaning somebody money is, am
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.520]   I willing to take that property back on the terms that I gave, on the loan to value, or
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.040]   the terms that I loaned them the money on?
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.960]   And if that's the case, if I'm willing to take the property back, then I'm willing to
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.800]   make that loan.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.760]   And so that's what his situation was.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.240]   And so that's one of many benefits.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.200]   But I think that flexibility and that ability to look outside the box on some collateral
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   is one aspect.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   The other aspect is, and I never ran into this, but it was always kind of helped me
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:13.520]   sleep at night in the back of my mind, is that I often thought, what if the price levels
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   dropped?
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.880]   We almost had a Great Depression again, Great Depression number two in 2007, '08, '09.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.200]   What had happened if the rents that I previously had at $1,000 a month dropped to $600 a month?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.040]   I mean, that's possible.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.920]   That's one scenario we haven't seen in our lifetime.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.120]   And if I have a, all of a sudden, my $500 or $600 mortgage payment that cash flowed
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.720]   yesterday isn't cash flowing today, what do you do?
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.240]   And in most cases, with a traditional loan, you're going to lose the property.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.600]   That's just the bottom line.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.640]   Well, there's a scenario, and that might still happen with a private lender, but there's
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.120]   a scenario I could think of, especially if I have a track record and trust level with
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   this person.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.640]   I go to them, I sit down, and I'm completely transparent.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.840]   I say, here's the situation.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.280]   Our rent that was $1,000 a month is now $600 a month.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.760]   We are upside down.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.320]   If we keep on going at this pace, it's going to be ugly.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.400]   And we just want to be honest.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.120]   And we're trying, before we ever have a problem, we want to talk about it.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.640]   And we might be able to work out something.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.640]   We're going to get creative.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.440]   We're going to sit over the table at coffee.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.240]   Maybe we can give that person equity in the property, and maybe they'd be willing to reduce
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.400]   some of the current cash flow in exchange for equity on the back end.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.480]   Maybe there's other things we can do for them.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.280]   The point is, you can be a little bit more creative when you have individuals that you
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.840]   can sit down with.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.640]   The other side of it, if you're having to sit down with a bank who's having their own
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.240]   financial trouble, they're calling in all their loans, the last thing they're going
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.840]   to do is be creative with you.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.480]   So that's another scenario.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.040]   It should be intuitive.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:48.000]   If you could sit down with somebody to whom you owe $100,000, and some of these deals
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.360]   may be much more, but a nice round number.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.000]   And if you're saying, "There's a good chance I'm not going to be able to pay you this $100,000
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.560]   back," they've got a $100,000 problem.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.240]   And when it's their money, they've got a $100,000 problem.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.280]   They're going to be motivated to say, "How do I solve my $100,000 problem?"
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.960]   That's the risk that we take as investors and as lenders when we lend money.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.240]   We're taking on the risk.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.160]   And so we know if something happens, I'm going to have a problem.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.360]   When you're dealing with a bank, you're calling an 800 number.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.520]   You're dealing with some mindless customer service rep that has no personal stake.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.680]   They're still going to get their $62,000 salary this year whether or not this particular deal
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   goes through.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.520]   The guys at the top simply said, "Hey, this is what we're looking for," and they've got
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.240]   to follow the situation.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.000]   So you've got to beat your head against the wall until finally maybe you can get somebody
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.640]   with some authority to solve the problem.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.160]   But if you can sit down at the table with somebody to whom you owe $100,000 and say,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   "Here's the deal.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.520]   Here's the situation.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.040]   This is usually someone who's going to be experienced in real estate.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.420]   They're going to understand the situation," you can work out a deal.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.480]   You have the most opportunity to work out a deal that's a win-win for both sides where
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:04.800]   his $100,000 problem is solved and your $100,000 problem is solved as well as compared to the
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   bank.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   Exactly.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   That's the attitude I've taken.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.360]   Fortunately, other than that one situation, I've never really had to call in favors of
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   my private lenders.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.840]   But the thing has been, and I've had them tell me this, they've been mentors as well.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.880]   That was another benefit of having private lenders early on is that these are people
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.600]   who have accumulated a million dollars in some cases, several million dollars.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.920]   Here I am as a rookie investor.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.520]   Who do I want loaning me money on my deals who can have an extra set of eyes other than
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.440]   somebody who's experienced and who's willing to give me advice and they're a mentor?
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.200]   I had all this mentorship along the way.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.600]   The thing they always told me was, I think it was a Zig Ziglar quote, which I've loved,
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:48.000]   is that if you want to become wealthy, I'm paraphrasing, if you make your investors a
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.840]   lot of money, you're going to just by default make a lot of money.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.800]   They told me that and they said, "Look, if you take care of us," and I know it's self-serving
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.680]   for us to say that, "But if you take care of us and always treat your investors well,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   make sure they're made whole, you'll have zero problem long run making a lot of money
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.320]   for yourself."
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.680]   That exactly panned out.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.520]   That formula panned out, particularly with private investors because I've made some of
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.560]   these investors money year after year after year after year.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.120]   Their retirement accounts have grown.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.160]   They've had stability through a big downturn.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.020]   They've gotten steady payments.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.120]   There's been some deals where I lost money, but I made sure they were whole and they knew
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.120]   that.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:32.280]   That kind of trust and credibility is a really long-term valuable thing to the point where
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.120]   now we're in much better shape now.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.880]   We've made it through those downturns and we've been going after opportunities for the
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.280]   last five, six years.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.120]   When we see an opportunity, we have these same investors who've been through the storm
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   with us.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.800]   When we see a big opportunity, we say, "Hey, got this opportunity."
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.040]   Sometimes it takes five minutes to put a deal together for several hundred thousand dollars
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.720]   of a loan or an equity stake.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.160]   That's the kind of power that it's not only a doom and gloom kind of thing to protect
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.600]   you during the downturn.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.200]   It's also an opportunistic thing because think about when the best opportunities are in a
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.800]   real estate market.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.240]   It's when there's very little liquidity in the financing market, in the bank.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.160]   The banks are not loaning money.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.320]   Well if you have this sort of recession-proof source of funds where you're taking care of
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.720]   several wealthy private investors, you can then go back to the till over and over and
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.040]   over again, especially during the chaotic times when they're kind of, "Oh, I don't know
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.680]   if I want to have my money here or there."
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.560]   Well, I've got this really good real estate deal that has a 10% cap rate.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.880]   It's in a wonderful location.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.840]   You'll loan me 50% of the value of the property.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.880]   So if something happened to me, you could take it back and be in an incredible position.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.200]   You get these kind of relationships and you're protected on the downside, but you also have
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.160]   the ability to move really, really quickly when a good deal comes about.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.920]   That's something else that John Chavez talked a lot about is it's really difficult to move
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.200]   fast on the best deals if you have to go apply for a loan, get an appraisal, do all the inspection.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   That's just too slow for the way real deals work in real estate.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.520]   This is how it works at the lower end and also how it works at the bigger end.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.760]   When people are experienced and they come across a deal, when they see the deal, they're
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.960]   confident of it.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.960]   If they've got the track record with their investors, they'll write a contract right
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.000]   there and then go make phone calls for the money.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.320]   The thing that I think is often a little bit opaque to people who haven't been involved
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.680]   in the investment markets on a personal basis yet, because many of my listeners are employees,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:38.080]   many of them, their investing is constrained primarily to perhaps investing in a retirement
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.620]   fund at their job, things like that.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.480]   When you haven't been involved in the active markets or people actively marketing, it seems
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.240]   like finding money is going to be hard.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:53.880]   All the local rich people that I have interacted with, they're always looking for a good deal.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   They keep lots of money set aside.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.600]   You might reach them at a time where all their money is out, but in general, they usually
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.640]   take control of the money and they're looking for deals.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.360]   Your job is find the deal and the money will flow.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.520]   What I've often seen happen as well is if you've got a good deal and you call up one
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:18.760]   or two investors that you might have worked with, and let's say that at the moment, the
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.320]   majority of their money is out on deals so they're not able to invest with you, they'll
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.640]   pick up the phone and call other investors because they're passing along a favor to somebody
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   else.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   "Hey, this is a deal."
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.040]   They'll put in a good word and they'll open the doors to other investors.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   That's right.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.840]   Yeah, it's that first one that's the hardest, but once you convince one person with money
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.720]   that you're reliable and you know what you're doing, the second, third, fourth or fifth
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   are a lot easier.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   That's exactly the way it works.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   Bring it forward, Chad.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.360]   Are you willing to share with us what your portfolio and what your business looks like
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.880]   now 14 years later?
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.120]   Yeah, we can talk about that.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.600]   You want to know what kinds of properties, what they look like?
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.280]   Yeah, what are your investment strategies?
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   What are you doing?
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   How much are you owning?
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.080]   How much are you flipping?
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.200]   What has actually taken you 14 years to build it?
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.120]   What does your actual portfolio look like now?
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   Right.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   Okay, sure.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.480]   So for us, early on we were a multifaceted business.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.080]   We did a lot of finding deals, flipping them, assigning them to other investors.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:24.040]   But over time, our long-term evolution was we wanted to be a buy and hold investor.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.440]   That was our core strategy.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.920]   That was also our lifestyle strategy.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.320]   We don't want to be working a job all the time.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.120]   And so we wanted to transition a little bit more of the passive part of the business.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:40.680]   And so for the last five, six years, more of our evolution has been we own single family
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.200]   and small multi-unit buildings, and we're in a college town.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:52.360]   So most of our, I don't say most, I'd say over half of our properties are apartments
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.600]   typically on the lower rent end of the college town.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:03.120]   And you have some very luxurious, really nice apartments with pools and clubhouses and those
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.320]   sorts of things.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.920]   We're more on the grad students and the people who are looking to pay their own way through
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.200]   college and a little bit more affordable.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.920]   And so we like those older multi-unit properties, two bedroom, one bath, one bedroom that are
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.360]   walkable to campus.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   They can jump on the bus.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.720]   And so that's sort of our core purchase strategy that we're continuing today.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.280]   And we have, it kind of fluctuates because we're buying and selling a little bit, but
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.400]   we have about 60 units that we self-manage.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.960]   And so we have a business partner and I have done this business together for most of those
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.580]   13 years.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:43.040]   And so we have a little management company of our own that works out of my basement and
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.240]   we have people pay remotely, pay online.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.160]   We go, when we go sign a lease, we go meet at the local library.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.200]   You have all the contractors, we just meet them on site.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.600]   And so we have a very lean management business, but we can handle about that much because
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.240]   we have one good person who works with us who we've sort of trained up to do, initially
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.960]   do bookkeeping and then she learned how to do some of our collections and then do more
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.400]   of our kind of turnovers and working with the contractors to get stuff done.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:16.920]   And so I'd say 90% of the work, our one kind of in-house person can help us handle.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.800]   But if we get any bigger than this, which we are looking at a few more kind of bigger
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.680]   deals at the moment, that's sort of our lid on the number of properties we can manage
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.400]   with that structure.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.800]   And so we're probably going to go to third-party management with some local managers we've
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.200]   been cultivating relationships with.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.320]   And so we'll have some more properties managed by these other companies.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.600]   Why do you like the college apartments?
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.360]   Well, I mean, it started off because I was in a college town.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.560]   It was just sort of where I wanted to live and that was the best opportunity in our town,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.520]   the most stable investment.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.200]   We've been riding a fortunate demographic trend in our town because the college has
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.640]   been expanding.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:06.240]   So when I graduated in 2002, the university had about 17,000 students total.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:12.200]   And now we have 20,500 or so, almost 21,000 and there's supposed to be more on the horizon.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:19.160]   And so we've experienced zero, I mean, literally, maybe 0.3% vacancy over the last six years
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.320]   on most of our properties.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.360]   And we've had increased rents the entire time.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.560]   And so that's just been a fortunate, I didn't experience that early on when we first started
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.560]   doing it.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.160]   That's just been something you go through these waves or sometimes the things you have
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   no control over benefit you.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.320]   But I like the stability of college rentals.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.240]   There's some quirks that you have to deal with.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.720]   Everybody moves in at the same time in August.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.040]   Everybody moves out at the same time as you have these turnover periods of one week where
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.520]   you're blitzing and fixing up, cleaning up properties.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.640]   But the positive side of that is we rent all of those properties for August and February
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.040]   and March.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.840]   And so we've got 100% of our properties rented before August.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.800]   And so we know which ones we need to hustle on, which ones we need to work on.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.640]   And so that's sort of the demand for rentals is the nice, one of the nicest part about
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   the college rentals.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.720]   Isn't it more labor intensive though?
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   Yes.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.520]   So it's a little bit, so compared to, we also have single family houses, regular three bedroom,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.760]   two bath houses outside of the college town.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.080]   That's a smaller percentage of our portfolio, but that's your typical John Schaub kind of
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.360]   investment.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.240]   And we also have some single family houses in our college town that we rent to faculty.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.040]   And those are night and day in terms of how passive they are.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.780]   I had one house that somebody just moved out of, they were there for four years.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.400]   They took care of, of course, all the yard work.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.880]   Occasionally we'd have to call somebody to do something, but it was very easy to manage
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.360]   that property.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.200]   These college rentals, they are more active.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.560]   So it's more of a business than it is a passive investment.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.960]   But at the same time, I could also, there are lots of investors here in town who hire
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:04.920]   third party management companies to handle a lot of that for 10% of the rent.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.240]   So it's not, there's more turnover, but at the same time you can build some systems and
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.080]   some models to handle that.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:18.600]   How do you decide how much of your time to allocate between running the businesses that
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.240]   you're involved in versus finding more investments?
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:28.280]   If you are focused on building long-term wealth through an investment buy and hold strategy,
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.040]   you've got 168 hours in your week.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   You could spend that time going and finding another deal.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.440]   You at this point could finance it with other people's money and possibly find a cash flow
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.920]   positive deal.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:45.080]   How do you decide to not pursue that in order to pursue your property management business
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:51.320]   or to not do a flip or not do a property management deal in exchange for going and finding the
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   house?
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   How do you make that decision?
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.120]   It's gotten easier now.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.000]   My answer to your question seven, eight years ago would be I do all of it and I just work
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.040]   80 hours a week.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.000]   But right now, I would have the business of flipping houses.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.520]   I would have the business of rental properties.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.300]   I would just do it all and we brought on help.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.600]   But currently, it's part of the evolution.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.160]   My climb up the mountain has been I've looked at, and this is something I got from a Tim
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:22.360]   Ferris book back in 2007, but I look at my time and my money as two different bank accounts
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.160]   and equally important.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.400]   As we've made more cash flow from our rental properties, I've been willing to give some
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:36.520]   of that money to other people to let them do some of the tasks I was doing before.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.680]   I might go from year to year and make the same amount of money even though our revenues
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.280]   in our business and our investments have gone up.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.320]   But it really has freed up my time immensely over the last few years.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:54.760]   Most of my time now, we did one flip a year ago and so actively, we're not as active in
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.000]   the business side of the real estate now.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.700]   We are more oriented towards the long-term purchases.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.360]   Most of the purchases we're making are not going to make us a huge amount of money right
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.880]   now, but they're going to make us a lot of equity on the back end, a lot of steady cash
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   flow coming in.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:16.720]   We're just building that cash flow because, again, going back to the frugality, you can
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:22.160]   cover most of your personal overhead with some of the steady rent that's coming in.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.720]   That gives you options to not have to go do the active stuff.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.160]   I've chosen not to do as much of the active real estate business, partly because I'm just
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.680]   interested in other things.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.040]   I'm writing a blog now.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.080]   I've been building that business for a year.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.840]   There's just been other interests and other things and family.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.320]   That's been the wonderful part about this.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:51.120]   That's the whole story of all this is that I haven't had to wait until I've been ultra-rich
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:58.200]   to be able to benefit from a lot of the lifestyle choices that come with that idea of being
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   rich.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.760]   I've been able to choose and say, "I don't want to work that hard here.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.000]   I want to work 20 hours a week in the active part of my business.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.040]   I want to work 20 hours building the wealth."
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.160]   Then that's it.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.200]   Maybe that changes from week to week or month to month.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.720]   At this stage, what does an average work week look like for you?
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.520]   I don't want the idealized picture.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.040]   I want the actual legitimate picture.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.400]   What does an average work week look like for you?
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.920]   Yeah, let's think about this week.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:39.120]   I'd say 50% of my time right now, we've just purchased a couple of rehab units.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:46.000]   So 5 to 10 hours of my week are going out and making sure that the contractor and the
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.120]   teams are doing what I asked them to do in the upfront bid.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.160]   You just have to be on site.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.880]   Whether you're going to be on site or somebody else is going to be on site, getting out there
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.000]   and looking at the project, there's just always little things that come up.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   So 5 to 10 hours a week managing projects.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.560]   But those will be done in about a month and be rented out.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.040]   So the next month, that 5 to 10 hours won't be there.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.160]   So that's part of a week.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:17.080]   Other parts are, we just did some marketing and some lead generation a month or so ago.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.720]   So I would spend another 5 to 10 hours a week just taking phone calls from people who are
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.480]   interested in selling their property, talking to them on the phone.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.040]   Today I had a 30-minute conversation with a gentleman who called off a letter I sent
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.440]   and we discussed his situation, his property.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.000]   I asked questions.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.240]   We went back and forth and had a conversation.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.280]   And then we set up a time for me to meet with him when he's going to be in town.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   And then I'll go meet at the property.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:47.080]   We'll take an hour or two, look at the property, go have coffee maybe, discuss the property.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:53.200]   And so that part of my time might be another 10 hours a week.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.840]   And then the other fortunate thing I've been able to do is think strategically.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.920]   I'm going and working on the business and what systems need to be improved.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.760]   And so I'd say another third or quarter of my week would be looking at some of our payment
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   systems.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.800]   I'm going to be leaving the country next year for a year and trying to manage our business
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.480]   from Argentina.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   And so how is that practically going to happen?
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.840]   If I'm not there, how can I pay my contractors?
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.880]   How can I deal with paperwork, sign leases, things like that?
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.440]   And so I'll spend time researching the paperless systems.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.480]   I'll spend time working on our talking to other investors, reading on websites like
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:38.200]   BiggerPockets, how other investors are doing it, and working on improving systems and making
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.080]   the business work better long run to be a little bit more passive, a little bit more
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.520]   systematic.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.240]   And so that's been probably another third of my real estate business.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:54.360]   So between those three, managing projects and other people who are doing things for
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:00.320]   me, including my bookkeeper and people who work for me, and then looking at deals, acquiring
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:06.120]   deals, working on systems, those are the three things I spend most of my time on in the real
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   estate business.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:12.120]   I'm doing a lot of writing, but my wife would tell you, we put the kids to bed at 8 o'clock
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:18.920]   and I'm writing from 9 o'clock until 12 o'clock sometimes, writing blog posts.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.200]   My real estate business is sort of like my laboratory, and then I'm going and writing
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.720]   an article and saying, "Here's what happened.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   Here's the mistakes I made."
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:31.520]   And so I love that juxtaposition of learning, going to a John Schaub seminar, learning what
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.160]   he tells us to do, going and practicing it, seeing if it works for me, and then going
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.000]   and discussing and kind of boiling down the results in an article and sharing it with
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   other people.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   So that's just a cyclical thing for me that helps me learn and do better in my own business.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.840]   What is the real estate advice that you consumed when you were in your early 20s that you believed
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:01.520]   at the time, but now you look back on and would no longer believe or advocate for?
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:15.080]   Yeah, I saw a lot of advice about nonchalance with leverage, being too not cautious enough,
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.040]   not careful enough with leverage.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.000]   And I think that, and today I see that coming back a lot.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.640]   I think that permeates not just real estate, but the entire financial spectrum.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.360]   I don't think people really understand risk and they understand what can really happen
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.280]   and they usually project out what's happened for the last two or three years instead of
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.680]   20 years in the future.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.320]   So I think particularly for new people and a lot of the real estate businesses has a
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:46.080]   lot of educational people, late night infomercial kind of people, you sell the sizzle and not
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.160]   the stuff that's scary because nobody would buy the scary stuff if you actually told them
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.280]   what was going to happen.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.780]   And so I think that I would learn strategies and I don't know if I want to get into the
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.280]   weeds of specific strategies.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.480]   I can't, well I'm happy to, but there was something called like a buying a property
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:07.000]   subject to the mortgage and you would buy it and there was this enormous amount of things
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.120]   you need to think about with these subject to strategies and some of these more creative
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:14.800]   strategies and yet you'd go to a read a book or go to a seminar and they would say, this
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.960]   is a way you can get in without having to go to the bank, without having good credit.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:24.520]   And I just think that's really dangerous because my idea has been you have to master a subject,
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.360]   you have to really dig into it deep, you got to get advice, you got to get help and so
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.280]   I think that kind of selling people the surface level of knowledge is really dangerous, particularly
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   when you're dealing with huge assets that have a lot of leverage.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:42.800]   I mean that's just asking for a lot of trouble for people and so I think that idea needs
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.960]   to be, a little bit of fear needs to be in people's head and I think that fear is healthy.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:54.040]   I don't mind, I'm an entrepreneur, I like taking some chances and knowing that the upside
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.160]   is there if I take a chance and I think most people who are willing to get an entrepreneurship,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.840]   if they can look at the risk with open eyes and they know what's possible, they can then
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:08.120]   make choices to either do what we were talking about earlier, only get financing that has
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.680]   some feasible terms and that has ability to have some flexibility or also maybe you just
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.840]   hustle more, maybe you decide I'm just going to sell this deal quicker or whatever it is,
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.800]   if you know that risk, you can deal with it instead of kind of having your eyes closed
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.400]   a little bit by some of the education out there.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:31.600]   What's the next stage for you with regard to financial freedom?
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:38.160]   Well I think it's continuing, I sort of compared our business to, maybe you know more about
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.640]   the stock market and businesses than I do maybe but my understanding of a lot of mature
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.480]   businesses was that as they grew, during the early entrepreneurship stage, you had to take
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.840]   some chances, sometimes you had to use some leverage but then as you grew, you became
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.680]   more and more stable on your balance sheet and so for me and my business partner, it's
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:03.640]   been strategically paying off certain properties, reducing risk, increasing cash flow and then
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.560]   on other properties, not necessarily paying off all the properties but on those other
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.240]   properties, shoring up the financing, getting long term, low interest financing to sort
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.800]   of hedge your bets for the future and so I think we're just, to answer your question,
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.040]   we're trying to stabilize and kind of be a nice solid base of cash flow and be able to
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:28.000]   handle all sorts of different situations that could come about but most of all, having that
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.460]   stability so that we can continue doing, exploring new things.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.880]   Real estate is very fun for me, I enjoy it but it's only part of the, it doesn't capture
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.360]   my interest 100%.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.080]   I've got other things that I really like to do.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.440]   My wife and I like to travel, I like to learn foreign languages, I like to teach my kids
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.520]   different things and be involved with them.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.160]   I'm working on a non-profit in my town to try to build a greenway through our little
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.520]   college town and I've become the president of that non-profit and I'm spending 10-15
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:01.560]   hours a week on that kind of thing and so there's all sorts of fun uses of my time that
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.720]   open up and so that to me is the future of my business is that I want to spend 20 hours
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.800]   a week or 10 hours a week on my business and then have the other amount of time to do whatever
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.600]   else it is that I want to do.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.080]   Tell me about Argentina.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.960]   Yeah, so we traveled there in 2009 and just love it.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:27.000]   It feels like the western United States, big mountains, open spaces and we, my wife and
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.720]   I love speaking Spanish and we want our kids to become fluent and so we're looking at a
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.800]   couple of towns, we still haven't nailed down where we're going to be but it's either going
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:40.320]   to be Mendoza, I think it's kind of the wine region of Argentina near the mountains, lots
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   of outdoor activities or there's some other towns, there's a city called Cordoba, Argentina
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.640]   and we just, I think we're exploring it and it's going to be a fun adventure but I think
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.120]   we're going to get an apartment and walk our kids to school every day, let them enroll
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.760]   in a local elementary school, get to know people down there, experience another culture.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:06.840]   That's just sort of our little, our thing and the opportunity to be able to do that,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.640]   I feel really fortunate but it's just hopefully going to be an experience we can all look
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:16.800]   back on and say this has just been a fun growth experience for all of us.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.320]   Jad, this has been awesome.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   Thanks for coming on.
