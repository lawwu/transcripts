[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.380]   I've heard again and again and again from people in my own personal life clients that are people who say I don't borrow money and I take them at their word and I believe them except then a few years later I find out that they did borrow money now each of us has to navigate this particular this particular road I have no problem with somebody engaging in the borrowing of money if that's the decision that they choose I believe that it is morally wrong to default on debt so thus I believe that it is morally wrong to default on debt so thus
