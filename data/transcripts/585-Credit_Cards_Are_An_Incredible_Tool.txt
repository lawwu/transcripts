[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.360]   ♪
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.960]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.600]   My name is Joshua. I am your host. And no, I am not dead. No, I am not sick.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.340]   And no, we did not fall off of a mountain. So thank you for your concern.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.020]   I have been busy the last couple of weeks putting the finishing touches on a new course that I'm launching to you on Monday.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.220]   A course on credit cards. The title is "How to Borrow Money Safely and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards."
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.360]   And as with many of my projects, I find that my creativity is about five times bigger than my ability to actually implement anything.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.100]   And everything takes about five times longer than I think it should.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.680]   So the projects that I schedule a couple of weeks for, well, in this case, it's wound up being two months.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.640]   And the problem's exacerbated by all kinds of various things.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.940]   But it is almost entirely ready, and it will be fully ready by Monday.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.180]   And so in today's show, I'm going to give you just some thoughts and some ideas that I think you'll really find interesting.
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.760]   And part of this will be to help get your mind thinking about the subject of credit cards, hopefully in some ways that are unique.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.440]   Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be dripping out some information for you, a couple of audio excerpts from the course, etc., to incentivize you to buy it.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.060]   There'll be a discount period, which will save you some money.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.440]   And I hope that this course that I've prepared will really serve you effectively in something that's unique.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   And I believe that it will have a wide appeal for a number of reasons.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.960]   First, this will help you if you are currently in debt.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.280]   If you owe any money of any kind, this particular course will help you.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.760]   Because I'll help you develop the strategies to borrow money safely and not pay interest with credit cards.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.160]   Which means, and I think you should give serious thought to even refinancing some of your debt using some of the strategies that I will outline for you in the course.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.560]   But if you're not in debt, this course will help you to make sure that if you ever are in debt in the future,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.600]   you've set up the infrastructure to make sure that you borrow money safely and never pay interest.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.760]   And also, if you are wealthy, you're not in debt, you're never going to be in debt,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.840]   then I think some of the ideas that I present in this course will help you to help others who are in debt.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.360]   Because this particular project of mine has come from a place of experience, my own personal experience, the lessons that I have learned,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.720]   and also a place of concern, because I get sick and tired of seeing people abused by the credit card system.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.160]   And usually, the people who can least afford to be abused are the ones who are the most frequently abused.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.880]   And I don't like that.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:12.960]   I would like to see those of us who are in a strong place help the people who are frequently and often abused by the systems that are out there.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.440]   And many people have a very tough situation with credit cards.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.160]   Well, I think a lot of this can be avoided.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   And I want to give you some strategies and ideas that will help you to avoid these problems for you.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.680]   So also, real quick, as I begin today's show, I've also published an announcement.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.440]   I'm hosting a special Q&A call specifically on the subject of credit cards.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.200]   If you currently have credit cards, if you have credit card debt, if you have any questions about credit cards,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.720]   if you want to discuss any aspect of credit cards, I would love for you to join me for the call-in show on Friday, October 5.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.880]   I have published a separate audio file with the call-in details of that.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.760]   But please join me for that call-in show.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.400]   I would love to speak to you there.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   Now, let's talk about credit cards.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.800]   We need to begin, of course, with the obvious discussion of debt.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.720]   Debt is a very fraught subject.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.560]   And there are a lot of strong feelings.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.200]   And usually, this subject of debt and credit cards is one of the more divisive arguments in personal finance.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.240]   And people often take a couple of extreme perspectives.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.080]   And almost everybody agrees on the idea that you shouldn't be in credit card debt.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.840]   Now, of course, reality, the actual data that exists on the number of people that are in credit card debt,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.720]   shows that that argument might be common in the personal finance world.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.400]   But in general, many people have credit card debt.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.800]   I actually don't even hold to that position.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.880]   My position is that credit card debt is actually some of the safest and lowest cost debt when compared to other options.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.000]   And in a moment, I'll give you examples as to why I would say that.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.400]   But many people would say, "Well, credit card debt is the worst form of debt. I don't buy it.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.720]   I just don't see the evidence for that."
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.680]   I think that credit card debt is potentially very dangerous.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.080]   It can be very risky, depending on how we measure this term "risky."
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.840]   But it also can be extremely safe, depending on how we measure the term "safe."
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.280]   If I were to ever go into debt in the future,
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.120]   one of my primary choices would be to use credit card debt as my financing source versus other forms of debt.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.520]   And I'll explain in the audio today and in forthcoming episodes, little excerpts from the course that I'll share with you,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.240]   I'll explain to you why.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.600]   And I'll stand behind that.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.080]   Not in an absolute sense, not that credit card debt is always the first form of debt.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.480]   But when considering all the different forms of financing that are available,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.640]   I think credit card financing is a really compelling form of financing,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.120]   if you have the right infrastructure in place and if you know what you are doing.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.000]   So let's begin.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.760]   So I don't take that extreme position, even though that's the normally agreed upon discussion of credit cards.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.320]   Now, there are other discussions on credit cards.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.400]   For example, many people say, "I'm never going to borrow money,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.040]   and I'm not going to have any credit cards because credit cards are very dangerous."
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:12.120]   I respect that argument, and I entirely fine with people who take that position and follow through on that position.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.600]   That's a position that I have held in the past.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.400]   I have been an absolutist in the past.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.880]   Earlier I said that I had gone and I had all this massive amounts of credit card limit available to me, $100,000 when I was in college.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.960]   Well, after college, when I got out of debt, I canceled every credit card I had, and I went from $100,000 credit limit to zero.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.960]   So I have been through that particular...
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.000]   I've held to that particular position as well.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.760]   And I think that is probably the safest position.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.840]   I have no problem whatsoever with somebody who says, "I don't borrow money.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   I'm not in debt.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:54.920]   I'm never going to borrow money, and I'm going to forestall and preclude the possibility of borrowing money by even having credit cards available to me."
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.640]   I think that's a very safe position.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.480]   And if somebody is fully committed to that position, then I think then I respect that.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.480]   I love that position, as I'll talk about in a moment.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.440]   I want to talk about my own personal antipathy towards debt.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.800]   But what I have learned is many people who state that subsequently change their position.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.080]   I have heard again and again and again from people in my own personal life, clients, et cetera, people who say, "I don't borrow money."
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:28.800]   And I take them at their word, and I believe them, except then a few years later, I find out that they did borrow money.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   Now, each of us has to navigate this particular road.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.400]   I have no problem with somebody engaging in the borrowing of money if that's a decision that they choose.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   I believe that it is morally wrong to default on debt.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.600]   So thus, if you pledge your hand and you make an agreement to borrow money, I don't think it's morally wrong to make that agreement.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   But it is morally wrong for you to not follow through on that.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:12.720]   And you wind up putting yourself in a hazardous position where by making a pledge that you will do something, especially if it's to borrow money, you open yourself up for a moral hazard of not being able to do it through circumstances that are outside of your own hand.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.520]   That opens you up to the possibility of sin if you don't follow through on that.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.400]   So that's, of course, a significant problem.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.520]   But what I've learned is many people borrow money, even though they said they wouldn't.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:33.920]   Now, of course, there are other circles and people who say, "Well, yes, I don't carry a balance, but I use credit cards for everything because it gives me good consumer protection.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.560]   It gives me good airline miles, bonus points."
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.480]   Those are, in my mind, strong arguments.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.680]   Many of those things are strong arguments, and there are good counterarguments as well.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   But my focus is different because I want to talk to you about credit cards as a safe form of financing and as a cheap form of financing.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:59.280]   Because in the times that I have been in credit card debt in the past, I've learned that I've gotten out of that world much cheaper than many other people.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.040]   So let's talk just for a moment more on debt and then also on credit cards specifically.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.480]   So first on debt.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.800]   For clarity, I don't like debt.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.520]   I don't like debt for me.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.800]   I don't like that for any person.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.760]   I don't owe anybody a dime, and I intend to never owe anybody a dime for the rest of my life.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.440]   That's what I want to happen.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.680]   I've learned not to make absolute statements.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:35.360]   You'll notice I didn't say I never will because in the past, my absolute statements, I've often found that life decisions change certain things, and then I have to rethink some of those things.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.960]   But I don't like being in debt.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.640]   I don't ever want to be in debt.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.080]   And I can't imagine the circumstances that would ever cause me to want to be in debt in the future.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   And there are two reasons for that for me personally.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.880]   Number one, my highest financial priority is freedom.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.180]   Freedom.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.720]   I want to always be financially free.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   And every form of being in debt will diminish my financial freedom, including credit cards.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.600]   If you are ever in debt, you will lose some of your financial freedom.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.120]   Now, you might have compelling reasons why you're willing to give up that freedom.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.600]   This is normal in life.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.520]   We often find compelling reasons to give up freedom.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.280]   I'm married.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:35.120]   Entering into marriage lowered my personal freedom, but I gained a whole other swath of benefits that made it worth it.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.160]   Some people go and they join, go to a university.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.560]   Well, in going to the university, you're going to give up some of your personal freedom,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.360]   but yet you're gaining benefits from that.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.840]   Some people go and join military organizations.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.320]   Well, in so doing, you're giving up a significant amount of freedom, but some people still believe
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.480]   that that's worth it for them to do it.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.680]   Some jobs that you take, if you go and take a job, you are giving up a measure of personal freedom,
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.200]   but yet you're also getting certain benefits.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.760]   The unemployed person on Monday morning can do whatever they want to do,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.000]   but they also have no money.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.840]   Whereas the employed person needs to report for work at 9 a.m. on Monday morning,
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.080]   but they get other benefits such as a paycheck.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   So, the appeal to freedom is not an absolute appeal.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.560]   And many times people go into debt and they give up a measure of freedom because of the other things that they gain.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.080]   Rather, obviously, many people will borrow money to buy a house,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   thus giving up some of their personal freedom.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.480]   They give up the freedom to move.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.920]   They give up the freedom to change their residence without cost.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.360]   They give up their personal freedom in terms of the amount of things that they have to go along
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.600]   with the ownership of that physical property, but they gain the benefit of living in a nice house.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.960]   And I respect those decisions.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.440]   But I think you should always acknowledge that if you ever go into debt, you give up freedom.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.160]   And for me, because freedom is a higher priority to me than almost anything else,
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.800]   including lifestyle, including almost anything else, then I don't ever want to go into debt.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.160]   The other major concern I have about debt is always that debt brings the potential for moral hazard.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.640]   A moment ago, I talked about the fact that you wind up putting yourself in a hazardous position
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.880]   if you pledge your – you give your word, "I will pay you according to these terms,"
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   and then something happens outside of your control that causes you to fall through on that.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.480]   And now you have compromised yourself and you have not paid as agreed, which is morally wrong.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.640]   That's a moral hazard.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.680]   Another moral hazard is simply if you wind up deep in debt,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.240]   then it can cause you to make decisions where you're prioritizing money over something else.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.160]   You're deeply in debt and you know you should take a stand for what's right and what's true
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.080]   and what's righteous, but yet, "Oh, I can't do that because then all of a sudden my affairs
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.880]   will be exposed and I'll lose my house or I'll lose my car or something, so I have to just keep
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.560]   the job and I have to keep doing something that's unethical. I have to keep doing something that's
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.600]   morally wrong." Or you might expose yourself to the potential for blackmail or some other form of
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:08.640]   of that type of situation. So being in debt can bring a significant form of moral hazard.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.400]   So I don't like being in debt, but I also recognize that debt can be useful and debt
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.760]   can also be used in different ways. People have different understandings of what it means to be
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.160]   in debt. So some people when they say, "I'm in debt," let's say you have no money and you have
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.320]   no money, no assets, and you owe $10,000 on student loans, are you in debt?
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.920]   Or are you not in debt? Well, it should be obvious that you're in debt. Now, let's say that you have
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.360]   $20,000 in the bank and you owe $10,000 on student loans and you're choosing, because of the low
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.760]   financing terms, to simply keep those payments as they are and not to take money from your bank
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.520]   account to pay off student loans. Are you still in debt? Well, there are, of course, obviously yes,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.400]   and in some ways, no. Many people say, "Well, I'm not in debt," but yet they have a mortgage.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.120]   Well, what if you're using these different tools and they're useful as financing tools,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.760]   but you're not behind? Some people use the term being in debt to mean not making a payment as
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.920]   agreed, not making a time payment as agreed, and I think that's a fair argument. So these terms
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.880]   have different meanings. So my point about all of this is to try to appeal to you. If you have
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:26.640]   uniquely strong opinions or uniquely strong convictions, to appeal to you to consider them
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.320]   and to consider what's right for you, filter everything through your own personal convictions,
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.720]   but to think about how you can set things up to help you and to help others. Now, credit card debt,
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.160]   back to the specifics of credit card debt. Credit card debt is unique because for most people,
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.640]   credit card debt is a major curse in their life because most people have no plan as it relates
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.080]   to credit card debt. In the course content, the actual specific course content, I make it very
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.360]   clear that the only way to win at the credit card game is to make sure that you have a plan for
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.200]   eliminating your credit card debt balances completely and getting out of debt. And that
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.000]   is true. The only way to win at the credit card game is to have a plan for completely eliminating
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.400]   your balances. But most people have no plan whatsoever, not even a plan for getting out of
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.320]   debt, but not even a plan for how they're using credit card debt. The way that people assemble
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.760]   their credit card portfolio is fairly thoughtless. They usually just bumble into it. The mailboxes
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.800]   shows up with a credit card offer from the bank and they say, "Oh, this sounds good." They sent
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.720]   me a check and they sign up for the credit card. They're at their local retail store and local
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.240]   retail clerk says, "Hey, would you like to sign up for our credit card and save 5%?" "Well, sure.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.960]   Sounds good." And they don't ever put together a thoughtful portfolio that's designed to serve
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.160]   them or that's designed with safety in mind. And then what happens is people wind up in a
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.320]   situation where they desperately need access to money, need access to financing, and they wind up
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.600]   borrowing money from really unwise sources because they didn't put in place the infrastructure for
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.720]   it far in advance, especially the infrastructure related to credit cards. I want to give you a
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:03.040]   couple of examples because my hope, as I stated earlier, hope is that you will benefit from this
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.520]   particular educational content for your own life, whether you're in debt, out of debt, if you're in
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.560]   debt, I'll help you get out of debt faster and at lower cost. If you're out of debt, I hope you set
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.960]   up something as a good, useful reserve fund for yourself. And I hope that you'll take this and
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.640]   use this to teach to other people, because I get really frustrated with the people who are the
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.840]   most frequently abused by the systems that are out there are frequently the people who can't
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:33.440]   afford to be abused. They're usually not very learned and they're not very connected and they
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.680]   wind up being the most deeply abused. Let me talk for an example of what I mean with related to
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.400]   credit cards for somebody who is financially destitute. Let's say that I were financially
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   destitute. I had no money, I had no job, and I desperately needed a job. But my living circumstances
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.040]   meant that I had to have some form of transportation to get to my job and I couldn't figure out a
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:02.000]   solution that was different from my buying a car. Well, in that circumstance, I think it makes sense
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.560]   to buy a car. If I need a car to get to work, as many poor and destitute people need,
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.720]   I need to have some way of, that's a valid decision. Now, here are some problems that
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.840]   many people face when they buy cars, especially the people who are the poorest.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:26.880]   Reasonably priced cars, good quality, cheap used cars are not traditionally financeable.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:35.440]   You can't go and get an auto loan for a $2,000 beater from your bank. You can't go and get an
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:42.640]   auto loan for a $2,000 beater from a mainstream auto financing company. The only place you can
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.080]   get an auto loan for a $2,000 beater is from a buy here pay here place.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:54.320]   And I'll get to the problems of that in a moment. So what frequently people find out is they have
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.120]   to go down to Toyota financing department or Ford motor company financing department or whatever,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.920]   and they have to borrow money for a new car or a mostly new car. Well, that's a problem because
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.880]   a poor person, a destitute person cannot afford a new car. You cannot afford when you're broke
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:17.680]   to be driving around on a $30,000 car that's going to cost you $4,500 in depreciation this year.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:25.600]   You need a $2,000 car in that circumstance. So this financially destitute person figures that
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.760]   they have no option except to buy the new car. Years ago, I did financial counseling for this
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:37.520]   lady. She was a Spanish lady, immigrant, didn't speak English and did house cleaning for commercial
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   cleaning. And she was driving around a very nice Honda Element, but she had to buy it mostly new
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:50.240]   for the same problem. Now, she was at her wits end. She had no ability to, she was completely
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.320]   financially broke. She couldn't figure out how to get out of her problems. And the problem was that
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.200]   she had this stupid expensive car with an expensive car payment. And so I pleaded with her, I said,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.680]   "Sell the car." But she couldn't sell the car because the car was worth less than she owed,
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.160]   and she didn't have the money to get out. Sound familiar? You ever known anyone in this situation?
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.880]   So you have this stupid circumstance where a person who is totally broke is driving this
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.320]   fancy car around, but they're totally stuck because they borrowed money using the car.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.160]   Now, here's the problem. Let's say this destitute person, they got to have a car. They don't have
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.520]   any money. They don't have anybody who can give them a car. They can't figure out a solution.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   So they got to borrow the money. So we see the problems with buying a new car because you can't
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.440]   get financing for it. So you say, "Well, let's say I go and buy a cheap car." Well, the only way you
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.480]   can buy a cheap car on credit is to go to a buy here, pay here car dealership. Well, what happens
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:47.760]   in that situation? Well, first, the car itself is sold at a very high retail price. And whereas this
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.160]   person, if they had $1,500 in their cash, could go on, in their pocket, they could go on Craigslist,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.040]   pull out the $1,500 and buy a perfectly reasonable car off Craigslist or off the side of the road,
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.800]   they will pay at the buy here, pay here place $3,500 for that same vehicle. When you're broke
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.280]   and poor and destitute, you can't afford to pay $3,500 for a $1,500 car. But because the buy here,
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.800]   pay here place will finance a $3,500 car, they feel like they have no other option.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.920]   What else? What about the financing rate? Well, same thing. Financing rate is very,
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.360]   very high with the buy here, pay here place. And here's what's worse. Let's say that this
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:32.160]   person goes out and signs up for the car. They go and they get the $3,500 car that's actually
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:39.280]   worth $1,500, but they paid $3,500 for it. Now they have wheels. And something happens because
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:46.480]   they're living so close to the razor edge. Something happens and they can't make a payment.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:53.920]   And then they can't make another payment. What happens? The repo man literally comes
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.000]   picks up the car from their driveway or comes to their place of work and picks up the car from the
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.800]   parking lot and hauls it away. And that person who is living on the razor edge has to sit there
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.120]   and endure the humiliation of watching their car be dragged out of the parking lot because they
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.000]   missed two months payments. Most of the times when you buy a car from a buy here, pay here place,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.840]   they hold the financing. The car itself has a GPS chip in it. So even if you go and hide it
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.520]   in your neighbor's garage, the GPS chip reports the location. And of course, people who are in
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.200]   this situation don't read the paperwork. They don't understand it. They're not aware of the
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.920]   fact that the car has a GPS chip and the financing company can do it at any point in time.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:46.800]   Now, what do you do? How do you solve that problem? Well, first, hopefully this is where
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:53.040]   a network comes in. Hopefully this is where somebody who has an extra car notices somebody
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.080]   who's destitute but who needs transportation and says, "I'll help you," and they give them a car.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:03.120]   Hopefully this is a situation where this person can find another solution, such as riding a bus,
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.800]   so they don't go into debt. But if I were in that situation, here's what I would do.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:15.440]   I would get a credit card and I would get a cash advance on my credit card.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:22.320]   And I would use that cash advance on a credit card to go and buy a cheap, reasonable, used car
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   off of Craigslist or wherever I found one. And I would use the cash advance from the credit card
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:34.240]   to pay that off. Now, what benefit do I get? Well, first of all, I finance the car,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.560]   which allows me to get to work to earn money, to pay off the loan, and to pay the other things that
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.240]   I need to provide for my family. Secondly, because I've used a source of financing that wasn't
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.160]   connected to the specific vehicle, I can shop the used market outside of the dealership, which means
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:59.280]   I get the best possibility of getting a quality vehicle at a low price. So instead of paying $3,500
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.840]   for the car, I can pay the $1,500 for the car. Third, because I'm using a source of financing
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.880]   that wasn't just related to the sale of the car, I also can use additional money to fix up the car
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.440]   or fix it if it breaks down. And I don't just have to make that monthly payment and figure out how to
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:23.440]   also come up with the extra money. I can fix a lot of things on a $1,500 car by saving $2,000
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.800]   on the purchase price. Fourth, if I get behind on my payments, there is no legal right for the
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:37.920]   credit card company to send the repo man. So I've avoided the repo man. The credit card company
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.040]   doesn't even know what I used the cash advance for on my credit card. They don't even know.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.200]   And so they can't send the repo man and they have no legal right to send the repo man.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.040]   And now if I get two months behind because I have some unavoidable financial
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.240]   circumstance in my life, now if I'm two months behind,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:03.520]   I have plenty of time as the credit card company starts sending notices and letters and such,
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.720]   I have plenty of time over the next year, two years, three years to work harder, save up the
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.200]   money and pay them off before I ever wind up in court. And I still have the car the whole time.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.800]   So credit card financing is a much safer form of financing for somebody who's in this situation
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:26.080]   than the auto loan is. You get a cheaper car, a better deal, and you have a safer situation.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.120]   Now, what about the interest on that cash advance? Because after all, what if I'm paying 18% for my
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:40.160]   cash advance percentage rate versus a cheaper loan, a 7% loan from the car dealer? Yeah,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:47.360]   but I'm buying a car for $1,500. So if the numbers that I said are right, notice what I've done.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.880]   First, I've avoided buying the $35,000 car or the $30,000 car, which is saving me huge amounts
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.080]   of money on the depreciation of that new vehicle. I don't have the money. I can't afford it.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:02.000]   Second, I'm buying it for $1,500 instead of $3,500 at the dealership because I don't need
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.320]   this financing system that the dealership offers.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:12.640]   And if I do things right, very simply, I take a card, I take a cash advance, I apply for another
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.520]   credit card because I have a good credit score and I build my credit score. I know what I'm
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.120]   doing because I took Joshua's course. And I go and I get another credit score card. I may pay 18%
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.680]   on that credit card for a month or two, but then I'll quickly do a balance transfer fee,
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.320]   balance transfer with a 3% balance transfer fee, and I've dropped my effective interest rate to 3%.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:43.200]   So now I have a $1,500 car and a 3% loan instead of a $30,000 car or a $3,500 car and a very
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.040]   expensive loan. And I have safety. So if I can't pay my loan as agreed, I can still keep the car
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.520]   for long enough to give me time to fix my financial situation. That's an example of the power of
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:03.680]   credit cards. But I've never met somebody who was destitute that understood the system so they could
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.560]   put it in place in advance of when they need it. Unfortunately, the people who are destitute wind
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.920]   up being abused by the system because they don't know how it works. Now, what about another person,
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.480]   somebody who's getting out of debt? If you're getting out of debt and you are committed,
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.120]   you're saying, "I'm getting out of debt. I'm paying off my credit cards. I'm paying off my
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:27.680]   student loans. I'm paying off my car." Well, in that situation, you should lower your expenses
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.480]   to the maximum degree possible, and one of your major expenses is your interest cost.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.760]   And you should always seek to improve your situation.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:42.640]   In the course, I talk a lot about the 0% credit card game. You should borrow money at 0%
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.240]   any time that's cheaper and safer for you than borrowing money elsewhere at a higher percentage
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.600]   rate. And when you understand the safety of credit cards because of their unsecured status,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.960]   frequently, if I were trying to get out of debt, I would frequently want to be refinancing debt
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:07.040]   that is less safe onto debt that is more safe. If you're paying 6% interest on your student loans,
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:17.200]   think about paying 0% interest on a credit card and how that's superior. The student loan debt
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.200]   is, thankfully, very stable in terms of its interest rate. Federally guaranteed student
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.960]   loan debt is great. It's very stable. But you will never, no matter what happens,
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:35.600]   you will never get out of paying that debt. It's not bankruptable. It only dies when you die.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   Well, credit card debt is one of the most likely debts to be discharged in any form
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.160]   of bankruptcy proceeding. And sometimes, if you have a good credit score and you put the systems
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.720]   in place, you could borrow money cheaper on a credit card than you can even at 6%.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:28:01.520]   So if I had $20,000 of student loan debt, I would very diligently be moving that debt away
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:08.400]   from student loan debt onto a credit card because it's a superior, it's a safer form of financing
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.040]   as measured by the creditor's ability to collect on the debt no matter what.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:22.080]   So people who are getting out of debt, you should refinance your debt as much as possible.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.520]   Now, here's a simple example. So many times, I've worked with people who are getting out of debt.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.240]   They got five credit cards, $30,000 of debt, and they're trying to dig out from under it.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:38.320]   And so they get an offer that says, "Hey, we've got a 0% offer for introductory purchases for 18
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.640]   months." And they look at that offer and they say, "No, I'm not going to use that because I'm
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.600]   getting out of debt." Meanwhile, they're paying 17% or 23% over here on another card.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:55.200]   Look at them and say, "Are you kidding me? Take that 0% offer and now put every single expense
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   that you have onto that card and put every dollar that you were putting on that expense down on the
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.440]   most expensive credit card and get this thing paid off." It materially improves your situation
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:12.160]   because you can refinance. So if you understand how these systems work, you can use the different
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.560]   offers that you get. Finally, what about somebody who just wants to have some form of financial
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.000]   backup? See, those of us who are fairly conservative financially often face a problem
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.280]   because when you're conservative financially, you put yourself in a situation where you can't often
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.840]   always take advantage of the opportunities you'd like to take advantage of. Let's say you're
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.080]   committed to saying, "I'm not going to borrow money." Well, in that case, you need to have
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.040]   substantial cash reserves, substantial emergency funds. What's the problem with emergency funds?
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:48.960]   Frequently, they pay you very low rates of return, very low interest. Stacks of $100 bills in your
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.360]   closet simply don't pay any interest. Now, they're available, they're accessible, that's useful,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.760]   but they don't pay any interest. Money sitting in your savings account or a money market account
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.000]   pays effectively no interest in today's interest rate environment. And so it's a little hard to
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.720]   look down and say, "Man, I'm going to have $100,000 just sitting there, not paying any interest." And
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:13.600]   yet you know you need it for some form of emergency. But yet, do you really? Does all of
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.880]   the money have to be sitting there in a savings account? Or could you do something different?
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:27.600]   Are there products and things that you could use? I maintain that there are. And most people,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.720]   rely on credit cards as their primary form of defense in a financial bind.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:40.640]   Now, I think that's a bad move. In the course, I have a segment called just "Why You Shouldn't
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:47.120]   Use Credit Cards as a Source of Financing." One of the biggest problems with using debt,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.640]   especially credit cards, as a source of financing is simply that it's never easier to pay something
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:58.000]   off later than today. It's always easier to cut now than pay off later. Think about this.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.160]   If you have a credit card and you lose your job, and your first inclination is to say, "Well,
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.600]   I'm going to go and I'm going to just keep my normal lifestyle and put those normal expenses
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   on my credit card." That's what most people's plan is. You've got a problem. Because two years
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.920]   from now, when you're employed again, you will have to pay double the payments. You have to pay
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:22.080]   for your future two-year lifestyle and today's lifestyle. So now, instead of having one set of
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.440]   monthly expenses, you have two sets of monthly expenses. It is always easier to cut now than
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.760]   to pay off later. I recommend instead of going into credit card debt, just sell your house and
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.600]   move or sell your car or move in with your family members or move into a tent in the forest or get
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.040]   food from the food pantry or dump all your bills and go work from the library. These are all better
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.880]   options, in my opinion, than going into debt. Because yes, you'll experience short-term pain,
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.640]   but now your pain only goes forward for four months. And then four months from now,
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.680]   when you're gainfully employed again, assuming you had no money, four months from now, when
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.720]   you're gainfully employed again, you put yourself in a situation where the pain stops. You have a
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:06.160]   normal income, you have one set of expenses instead of two sets of expenses, and life is
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.000]   better. I'd a whole lot rather suffer for four months than suffer for four years, which is what
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   most people who borrow money and credit cards when they get laid off wind up facing. So back to
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.960]   somebody who's in the situation. So credit cards are useful because they give you dramatically
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:30.720]   huge buying power with no current carrying costs. You can have $100,000 of credit limit available
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.200]   to you on your credit cards, and it will cost you nothing. If you have cards with no annual fees,
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.480]   it costs you nothing to have access to that money. Over time, you can systematically build
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.360]   that number as high as you want to and as high as they will approve you for. Let's just say you
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:52.000]   have $100,000 available to you. Now in an emergency, what do you do? You always keep some forms of cash
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.680]   on hand available to you. But because you have quick access to paying ability with the credit
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.040]   cards, you can now afford to adjust your other portfolio of financial products slightly
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:12.400]   to give you forms of saving that are perhaps slightly less liquid, but are still pretty safe.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:19.280]   It's my best example here. One of the things I really love about traditional whole life insurance,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.680]   cash value life insurance, is the fact that it's a very, very stable asset,
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:30.000]   which means that you can effectively move it into your cash column on your balance sheet.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.480]   It's equivalent to cash in many ways. Now it's not perfectly equivalent because you can't guarantee
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.160]   that the money's going to be out. As a matter of practice, the insurance companies will send it to
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.640]   you very quickly, anywhere from 24 hours and a wire transfer to a few days and a FedEx or a mail
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.880]   transfer, or they'll send you a check. But contractually, they have a right to defer that
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:57.360]   for many months. But as a matter of practice, they don't do that. But it gives you flexibility. And
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.080]   so if you have a situation, let's say you keep $100,000 in your cash values and your life insurance,
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.040]   I think that's a very reasonable number to put underneath your emergency fund.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.440]   But you wouldn't necessarily want to take it all out all of a sudden in an emergency. But what if
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.880]   you also simultaneously have $100,000 available to you on a credit card? So now you wind up in
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.800]   an emergency, you lose your job, something goes wrong, you have significant expenses.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:28.320]   Well, you can use the credit cards as your easy form of payment, your financing, you can then
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.760]   apply for various credit card financing systems. And you can apply for those at 0% or whatever
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   you're able to get. And if you wind up in a situation where you need to pay the debt off
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.360]   right a second, then you go ahead and take the money from your emergency fund and pay it off.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.800]   But if you're able to finance it using the credit card system with very low risk,
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.840]   now you can keep your other money productive and use the credit card system. So even if you are
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.600]   well-heeled, and you're not in debt, you still should think carefully about setting up your
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:01.680]   access to debt in case you ever needed it. Yesterday, I recorded an interview for Aaron
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:08.160]   Frankel's podcast, In the Rabbit Hole. And for that show, we talked about money and I just finished
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.040]   disaster preparedness month here on Radical Personal Finance. One of the best things you
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:19.120]   should always plan to do in a problem is leave. One of the best ways to avoid trouble is just
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.400]   simply leave, leave in advance. So I told Aaron in that show, I said, "If there's an economic
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.360]   collapse in the United States of America, if I can, I'm just going to leave. I'm going to buy
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.440]   plane tickets for my family and we're going to go somewhere." Well, how do you pay for that?
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.440]   Credit card. You can have backup sources of money, you can have international bank accounts,
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.920]   you can have foreign currency, et cetera. But as a matter of practice, you go to the airport or you
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   go to whatever your online ticket buying service of choice is, and you buy plane tickets for your
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:54.640]   family, you load your backpacks and your suitcases and you leave. When I travel, one of the things
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.400]   you always should do when you travel is make sure that you have multiple credit cards available to
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.240]   you. They're extremely safe as a backup form of financing. Because if somebody takes it and they
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.960]   make fraudulent transactions, you're not liable, you're protected from that. And so when you go to
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:14.320]   a foreign country, you should take significant amounts of physical currency, that's useful.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.600]   You should also take significant amounts of backup reserves. You might put a couple of gold coins in
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.880]   your money belt or something like that. But the most practical, reasonable way to have backups
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.400]   is to stash four or five different credit cards of Monavisa, Mono MasterCard, American Express,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.600]   depending on what's going to be accepted in different situations. And you stash those
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.360]   around your luggage, you stash those around your person. So that if your luggage gets stolen or
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:43.040]   your car gets stolen or your clothes get stolen, then you always have a backup form of financing
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:48.400]   to get home. It's happened to me, I had suitcases stolen when traveling, had my car broken into.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.560]   And by making sure that you think ahead and secret some things away, you're in good shape.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.680]   Your vehicle, your vehicle should have backup forms of financing in it. You should have some
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.560]   form of cash, some amount of currency tucked away. And you should have a couple of credit cards
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.320]   stashed in your vehicle. So that if you guide up in a situation, you got to figure out how to pay
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:14.080]   the tow bill. The credit card is the most reasonable, reliable way to do that. Now,
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.640]   most of us I think would do that just knowingly. But you also want to make sure you have the system
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:24.160]   in place. So if you wind up in that circumstance, you can continue to borrow the money cheaper.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.920]   So this is just an introductory discussion. And I simply wanted to actually record a show because
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.600]   it's been about two weeks now. I wanted to record the show. I want to invite you to my Q&A show
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:38.240]   tomorrow. And I just wanted to, I want to get your mind thinking about this. And I hope you'll buy
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.080]   the course when I launch it on Monday. I think you'll really like it. I'm really proud of it.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.040]   The other course, this is my second course offering to you. The other course that I did was
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.720]   a career and income planning course. Got great feedback from that. Many of my students, a bunch
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.400]   of people signed up. Many of my students were satisfied. Number of people wasn't right fit.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:03.440]   That was a very high end, expensive and in-depth, exhaustive course. It was a beast. This one is
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.480]   much shorter, quicker, and it'll be much less expensive. But I think it will really serve you
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   and will serve you with some ideas that I think are underrepresented in other places. And let me
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.360]   give you just one final word on kind of my business model going forward. When I started Radical
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:30.720]   Personal Finance, I had the idea, I had the dream, I had the idea that I was going to provide all
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:38.000]   this useful information for free for people. And that was my goal. I had this dream of a 15-year
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.560]   old kid in the hood finding my show and saying, "Wow, I can learn everything I need to know to
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.880]   get out of the hood." That was my dream. And what I learned after doing the show for a few years,
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.960]   and so in so doing, my goal was how can I provide everything I know for free
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:58.960]   so that it's accessible to the most people? What I learned is my audience,
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:04.480]   I have a few 15-year olds who are listening and I'm grateful for that. I'm so grateful for that.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:11.600]   But the majority of my listening audience is composed of successful, wealthy, well-educated
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:20.240]   leaders. Now, here's the great thing about that. That means that, first of all, there's a causation
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.920]   correlation to wealthy, successful people who seek out in-depth information because they need more,
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.680]   or are they wealthy, successful because they've always sought out in-depth information? Well,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:36.480]   who knows? I'm inclined to say that people are wealthy and successful because they've always
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.320]   made a habit of seeking out the best information. That's been my personal experience.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.480]   But perhaps more importantly, one of the problems you face as you go through life
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:51.360]   is you develop more, you wind up with more money and less time. So in the beginning of life,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.480]   you have lots of time and not so much money. And as you get older, more effective, more successful,
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.800]   bear more responsibility, you generally will wind up with less time and more money.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.280]   So the business model that I took in the first couple of years of radical personal finance,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:14.720]   of massively prolific verbal content that was minimally edited and just minimally edited,
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:19.520]   is not a good fit for somebody who's wealthy and effective and successful. It's a good fit for
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.160]   somebody who doesn't have any money, but it's not a good fit for somebody who's wealthy and
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:29.760]   effective and successful. And so what I'm seeking to do is to change the paradigm, to give you more
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:36.880]   useful, concise, carefully edited information that really serves you and to charge more for it,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.640]   because I think that will serve you better and it will serve me better. So instead of pursuing all
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.920]   kinds of advertising, you'll notice that I've kept the show almost entirely advertising free.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.960]   Instead of spending my time going out and recruiting advertisers so that I can do that,
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.120]   I'm going to continue to bring you good content, but I'm changing it and try to provide
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:02.080]   extremely valuable educational products for you. That's my goal. Unique, valuable, pithy,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.480]   concise, useful educational products. And here's what I'm trying to do with that. I'm trying to
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.120]   provide extensive personalization. So if you buy a product, you have a specific question,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:18.000]   I'll create specific answers to you in that. And then secondly, I'm seeking to, well, I always just
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:27.120]   stand behind my words. If you ever have a question about something that you buy and you say, well,
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.600]   I want to just try it, but I'm not sure about it. Always just try it. That's the great thing about
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.120]   digital products is it's relatively easy for me to say, try it. And if you don't like it,
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.080]   I'll give you your money back. And so try out the stuff that I'm bringing to you. I hope you like
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.120]   it. So look for that on Monday. Join me for a live Q&A call tomorrow on Friday, and I'll be back with
