[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.280]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.340]   Long time no speak to y'all.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.920]   I've been busy writing, but sorry I haven't been busy podcasting because priorities, priorities,
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.920]   priorities, priorities.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.760]   Got a couple of kids, got to manage, got a website to update and to write about.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.520]   And in this episode, I just want to talk about the housing market because the housing market
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.600]   is on fire nationwide and probably globally too.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.320]   And it's one of my favorite topics.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.440]   I love real estate.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   Real estate accounts for about 40% of my net worth.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.720]   I try to limit anything to under 50% just to be diversified.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.240]   But clearly real estate is one risk asset that I like that I think is going to benefit
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.560]   from an inflationary environment because inflation acts as a tailwind for real assets and inflation
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.220]   helps whittle down the real cost of debt.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.400]   So the real cost of your mortgage.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.160]   So first, let's talk about where we've come from.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.000]   If you've been listening to Financial Samurai since early 2020 or before, you will know
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.640]   that I've been talking about real estate for a while now.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.600]   And in 2020, I got all over real estate.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.080]   I talked about how real estate prices get impacted when stocks decline.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.880]   A March 16 publication on April 19, 2020, I published a post called Real Estate Buying
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.000]   Strategies During COVID-19, where it talks about trying to take advantage of the fear
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.720]   that any seller has to try to get a good deal.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.580]   I also talked about the best near term real estate buying opportunity, which is right
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.920]   in your own city because there's intra city migration happening back in 2020 and still
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.960]   in 2021 and I think beyond, where people are going to relocate from more expensive, closer
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.200]   to downtown areas of the city to less expensive, farther away portions of the city.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.960]   So if you can find opportunities, go explore neighborhoods you seldom ever visit, you thought
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.760]   were just too far away and find it because I think strategically, it's a smart move because
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.600]   you don't have to disrupt your entire ecosystem, your friends and so forth.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.320]   You can still get paid the same because you're in the same area as where you used to be working.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.960]   So I think that's a really smart move.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.040]   And then finally, I published a post on September 8, 2020, called It's Time to Focus on Big
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.120]   City Living Again.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.120]   Big City Living.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.800]   We're talking the classics, New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, DC, Boston,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   and so forth.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.160]   Because I think, at least back then, and I still think right now, the opportunity to
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.200]   buy big city real estate is right here, right now.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.420]   And I'm personally looking to buy a pied-de-terre in Manhattan.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.520]   It's one of my goals and one of my regrets of not buying real estate in Manhattan when
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.180]   I was there back in 2000 and 2001.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.120]   But we'll discuss that in some other episode.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.000]   And in this episode, I want to talk about all the reasons why I think the housing market
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.700]   won't crash anytime soon.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.960]   I think there is a feeling that the real estate market is a little too frothy.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.720]   I've actually noticed searchers online land on a couple of my posts warning people about
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.920]   the housing market from older publications and also warning signs on what to look for
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.180]   before you buy a house.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.880]   So I think this is really healthy.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.240]   It's good to be skeptical in a hot market because you don't want to be that one person,
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.120]   the one guy or gal who is the winning bidder out of 20 bidders, right?
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.440]   That's called winner's curse.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.300]   That means out of the 20 people, you are the only one willing to pay that price.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.280]   You don't really want to do that in any market, especially in a hot, hot housing market because
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.320]   let's say you do bid 10%, 15%, 20% above asking and it's 10%, 15% above the actual market
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.420]   value.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.840]   So we're talking about re-rating in terms of pricing.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.040]   That could pose a problematic for future gains, right?
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.600]   Because the market might have to catch up two or three years to get to your new high
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   watermark and the market might never catch up.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.840]   And also if you're trying to buy a property with debt, with a mortgage, you're going to
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.520]   have to have appraiser come out and appraise the property for your winning bid.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.120]   And if you bid too high, you might not be able to borrow that amount of money you were
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.120]   expecting.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.800]   So you might have to cancel that transaction or you might have to come up with a higher
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   down payment.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.480]   So just be careful in a bidding war.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   San Francisco, I've been in San Francisco since 2001.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.440]   We are famous for bidding wars and generally it's worked out well, but sometimes, right,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   it doesn't, right?
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.760]   In 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, not so good.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.080]   So be careful.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.280]   So where are we now in the housing market?
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:10.840]   Well, as of April 11th, 2021, the median sales price of homes sold is $341,000.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.240]   So depending on who you talk to, it's like 320 to 341,000.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:23.680]   So this is looking at MLS data, the multiple listing service data, and $341,000 is up 17%
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.200]   year over year.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.280]   That is crazy.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.240]   That is unsustainable.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.080]   So folks, first half of the year, it's generally strong and then it kind of fades into the
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.040]   summer and then it picks up in the fall and then fades again.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.680]   But up 17% year over year is unsustainable.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.760]   The pace of price growth has to slow down because it's the law of large numbers.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.460]   So in the second half of 2020, things started really heating up or started to heat up.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.760]   And so you're going to have higher comps.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.360]   And so the pace is probably going to slow down to 10%.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.520]   I'm forecasting with pretty high conviction that the housing market will continue to make
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   new highs for the next three years.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.040]   I've wrote that in my post and I think that average price growth is going to be in the
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.380]   high single digits.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.920]   So we're talking 7, 8, 9%.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.580]   And if I'm wrong, well, I'm just going to suffer the consequences as anybody with skin
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.280]   in the game does.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.880]   There is always risk when it comes to buying risk assets.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.680]   So we've all got to be big boys and girls and understand that we could lose money or
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.000]   we definitely might not be able to make as much money as we thought.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.500]   And we have to be okay with the consequences.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.320]   So let me rattle off 15.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.080]   Man, I thought it was only going to be 10, but 15 reasons why I don't think the housing
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.720]   market will crash anytime soon.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560]   So reason number one, rates will stay low for longer.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.400]   If you've read Financial Samurai since 2009 when it started, I've been talking about rates
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.080]   being low for the rest of our lives and it's going to continue to go down or continue to
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   stay suppressed.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.800]   Rates have been coming down since 1980s, folks.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.520]   And the reason why is due to better information efficiency, technology, global coordination,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.200]   being able to manage inflation better, and learning from previous cycles.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.120]   Oh, and of course, productivity gains as well.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.920]   We are much more productive now than we were 10, 20, 30 years ago.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.160]   You and I can do a lot more things than people from back in the day.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.940]   And that's thanks to technology productivity gains.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.840]   So given interest rates are going to stay lower for longer, and probably for the rest
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.940]   of our careers, I truly believe this, rates are going to be a tailwind.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.740]   They're going to be a continued tailwind.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.680]   They're not going to be a headwind that a lot of people fear.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.000]   All right, the second reason why the housing market won't crash, inventory.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.400]   Inventory will remain depressed for longer.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.160]   COVID has permanently increased the intrinsic value of real estate.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.680]   We're all spending more time at home.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.920]   We're working at home, we're playing at home, we're teaching our children more at home.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.680]   Therefore, if we're spending more time on a product, or any kind of good, or service,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.080]   we appreciate it more.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.040]   And I think we're probably all going to permanently spend a little bit more time at home at the
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   margin.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.200]   During perilous times, we hold on to what we treasure most.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:37.080]   This is why real assets like homes held their value while stocks crashed 32% in March 2020.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.040]   Unlike a home, you don't need stocks to survive, right?
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.200]   We need shelters to survive.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.920]   So if you can have shelter, and it can ride inflation, and generate income, perhaps, and
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.600]   appreciate in value, I mean, that's a win, win, win, win, win.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   And imagine you're a homeowner right now, do you really want to sell your home?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.240]   Well, yeah, maybe, why not?
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.720]   Because the demand is so high.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.880]   But do you really want to sell your home if you actually need to buy another home?
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.040]   I think the answer is no, unless you have a lot more capital, and you're willing to
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.200]   duke it out with the hordes of other people looking to buy homes right now, because inventory
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   is lower.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.840]   Therefore, it is only logical to hold on to your home for longer.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.000]   Further, what if there's another black swan event?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.240]   You know, let's say it's another pandemic, because there's another strain or whatever.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:34.520]   Your home is almost like an insurance policy to live at least a comfortable life.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.340]   Reason number three, potential homebuyers are much richer post pandemic.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.440]   Let's be frank here.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.720]   Let's look at our investment portfolios since January 1, 2020.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.300]   Let's look at our net worth gains since January 1, 2020.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:57.680]   I'm hoping the majority of listeners and readers of Financial Samurai are much wealthier now
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.120]   than pre pandemic.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.600]   I am most people I know are.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.840]   And so in this scenario, if you're wealthier, more money is going to flow towards real estate,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.480]   more money can flow towards real estate, and more people can buy more real estate, they
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.000]   can afford more because they're just wealthier.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.040]   Four, domestic and foreign institutional demand is increasing.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   It's very clear that institutional real estate investors are looking for single family homes
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.440]   and rental properties because they're searching for yield.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.760]   You're seeing it in the news and every single major publication.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.400]   I talked about it before, where the New York Times highlighted actually Fundrise buying
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.440]   this community property in Houston for like 32 or 34 million 124 homes.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.200]   And it was cheaper on a single family home basis than the median home price in America.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.420]   And so I was thinking to myself, that's actually quite attractive for the expense of capital
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.080]   on the coast looking for higher yields.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.920]   So it's not just domestic institutional real estate investors looking to buy more real
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   estate, sooner or later, and I think it's probably going to be sooner, foreign institutional
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.120]   investors are going to be buying up cheap American property.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.280]   American property is so cheap compared to international property.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.960]   And then if you talk about how much we can make to afford this property, there's just
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   no comparison.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:32.280]   For example, in Vancouver, Vancouver is as expensive as Manhattan and San Francisco.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.720]   But can any of you guys name two companies in Vancouver who are paying their 22 year
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.640]   old college graduates over $100,000 a year?
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.680]   I can't and I'm not being facetious, I just really can't.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.520]   So the income side of the equation doesn't really support the property prices in Vancouver.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:59.100]   And I don't think Toronto, Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore, all these international cities
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.400]   are much more expensive on an income adjusted basis than the most expensive cities in America.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.160]   And then of course you look at 18 hour cities and so forth, there's a lot of great value
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   in America.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.920]   The median household income is $68,000 and then the median home price is somewhere around
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.320]   $320,000 to $340,000.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.180]   So that ratio is pretty solid.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:30.740]   If you go to other big cities across the globe, the ratio is much, much higher.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:37.520]   And given money is very fungible, I just see foreign money coming to the United States
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.240]   and buying up our property.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.800]   So we better buy up our own property first before the foreigners buy our property.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.520]   All right, next reason, number five, the Federal Reserve and the federal government are pro-ownership.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:56.080]   Just look at what they are doing, pumping out massive amounts of stimulus.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.320]   They have forbearance packages to help renters and homeowners.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.520]   You got mortgage interest deduction, $250,000 and $500,000 tax-free profits based on single
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.640]   or married status.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.840]   Programs for first-time homebuyers where you only put down 3%.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.320]   1031 exchange, so you don't have to pay capital gains tax.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.200]   You just continuously defer any capital gains on your real estate.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.500]   And then historically, there's been bailouts of homeowners and big lenders.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.080]   So looking at history and looking at what the government is doing right now, you would
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.440]   be a fool to go against the federal government and the Fed.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.220]   You never fight the Fed, folks.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.760]   You will end up losing money.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.760]   And if you fight the federal government, you're going to get fined or go to jail.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.520]   All right, reason number six, demographic tailwind.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.360]   Fannie Mae estimates there are 88 million people in the millennial generation.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.200]   That's the highest number I ever heard.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.040]   It seems like the millennial generation continues to expand, but they're talking about people
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.640]   born between 1980 and 1999 now.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.160]   In the past, it was like 1995 or something.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.000]   Whatever the true number of millennials is, the point is there is a huge population of
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.360]   22 to 41-year-olds who are soon to be in their prime home buying years or who are currently
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.520]   in their prime home buying years.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.320]   So all the previous talk of the millennial generation renting for life and shunning home
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.920]   ownership is BS.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.760]   It's the same as it ever was.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.480]   Everybody who hopes to one day find the love of their lives and own a nice home and start
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.920]   a family-- not everybody, but a lot of people, right?
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.600]   Work hard to provide for your kids and then retire with a paid off home and et cetera.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.400]   These ideals, the middle class lifestyle ideals that we've talked about so much, they don't
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   go away.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.160]   They're the same as it ever was.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.880]   Millennials have been late to the home buying trend due to more education, more student
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.640]   debt, delayed unions, and more competition.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.720]   And it's interesting.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.760]   If you look at the median age for home buyers right now, it's shockingly high.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.040]   It's like around 47 years old.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.480]   47 years old, folks.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.400]   But the good thing is that hopefully all of us are living several years longer.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.140]   But if you're buying a home at 47 years old, the bright side is you hopefully have your
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.080]   finances much more put together than someone who's 25 or 30 years old.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.980]   You've had more time to save, invest, and so forth.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:31.880]   And hopefully, you're more mature where you want to buy property with someone and settle
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.280]   down and stay that way.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.600]   Of course, life always throws curve balls, and we just never know.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.740]   All right, the seventh reason, multi-generational wealth transfer.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:50.300]   The boomer generation, those born between 1944 and 1964, is one of the wealthiest generations
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   in history.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.200]   Probably the wealthiest because they've been able to invest and save in the longest bull
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.960]   market in history.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.840]   The boomers have about $30 trillion in wealth they will be transferring to their children
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.240]   when they die.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:09.680]   And so they're either going to start transferring it now or over the next 10, 20 years.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.840]   Hopefully maybe longer because I would love my parents to live as long as possible.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.200]   But what's also happening is that they are transferring money right now while they're
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.100]   living because they want to see the benefits, the joy of their giving to their kids and
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.600]   to institutions.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.520]   So revocable living trust business, that's booming.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.000]   Inventing of $15,000 a year, that's the gift tax exemption, is booming.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.400]   Grats, people are sending up grats to avoid estate taxes as well.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.240]   All these things are helping younger generations buy homes.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.920]   Again, in San Francisco, it often takes bank of mom and dad to come up with at least the
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.320]   down payment to buy a home.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   It's very ubiquitous.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.440]   It's like 50 to 60% of first-time homebuyers in San Francisco have help from their parents.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.800]   And so that's just going to happen throughout the entire country.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:06.280]   All right, reason number eight, homeowner equity cushion is massive.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.520]   If you look at the homeowner equity and mortgage debt outstanding chart by the Federal Reserve
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:18.480]   Board, you'll notice that homeowner equity is around $21 trillion versus $11 trillion
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.920]   in mortgage debt outstanding.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:27.600]   So that's kind of like having 65% equity in your home and a loan to value ratio of only
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   35%.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.080]   Most first-time homebuyers put down 10% to 20% for a loan to value ratio of 80% to 90%.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:40.480]   So if you have 65% equity in your home on average, you've got a massive equity buffer.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.200]   It's going to take a lot for you to foreclose or short sale your home.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.240]   There's no way that the average homeowner is going to fire or sale their home if they
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   have that much equity.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.040]   Okay, you never say no way, but it's going to take a lot, a lot, a lot.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.600]   In fact, with so much home equity, what's more than likely going to happen is the typical
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.280]   homeowner will take out a home equity line of credit.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.000]   All right, reason number nine, household debt as a percentage of disposable income is very,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   very low.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.120]   I've got a great chart on my site that shows that US household debt service as a percentage
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.080]   of disposable income is about 9%.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.240]   That's like a 50 plus year low.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.320]   In 2007, it was 13.2%.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.080]   So the absolute percentage numbers aren't huge, but the decline, the drop once you see
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.000]   the graph is quite significant.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.800]   And it makes sense.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.820]   People have made more money, they have more equity, rates have gone down, mortgage levels
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.520]   have gone down.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.720]   Therefore, debt service as a percentage of disposable income has gone down.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.880]   All right, 10, inflation is picking up steam.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.480]   We talked about this earlier in the podcast.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.000]   The Federal Reserve said they're going to keep the Fed funds rate at 0% to 0.25% for
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.140]   longer in the face of a recovering economy.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:06.240]   They want to make sure that employment gets down to 3%, 4%, basically full employment.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.680]   And they're willing to let inflation ride higher than the 2% target they have.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.520]   And the funny thing is the 10-year bond yield has already gone up from 0.51% in August 2020
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.720]   to about 1.55% today, whereas the Fed funds rate again is at 0% to 0.25%.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.560]   So the Federal Reserve can easily raise the Fed funds rate by half a percent or three
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.760]   quarters of a percent and the market will be probably like, okay, that's fine because
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.980]   the yield curve will still be upward sloping, right?
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.560]   Short duration to longer duration.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.840]   And so if inflation is coming, which it certainly seems like it is, you want to be long things
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:55.240]   like a hospital or services, private colleges and universities, medical care services, and
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.080]   housing.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.280]   That's what you want to be long.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.860]   But you really can't buy a hospital, a college, university.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:09.320]   You can buy UnitedHealthcare stock and so forth, which I have, because they'll just
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.280]   gouge you forever and keep on raising your healthcare premiums.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.600]   But what you can really do is buy housing and get long inflation because at the end
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.480]   of the day, that is the end good.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   Real estate is the end good.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:29.220]   You use money, you make money to buy housing, food, tuition, education, services, and so
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.220]   forth.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:35.800]   So if you can buy the end good, which is real estate, which everybody needs a home to live
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:44.880]   in, and it can cost cheaper over time, thanks to inflation, and it can rise in value partially
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.320]   thanks to inflation, it's just such a win for the average person, which is why real
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:57.040]   estate is my favorite asset class for the average American, average person to build
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   wealth.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.520]   Inflation really, really sneaks up on all of us, folks.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.680]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.200]   You hold an asset for 10 years, and it's just pretty nice to ride inflation instead of get
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.360]   beat up by inflation.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.640]   11.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.960]   The amount of funny money is exploding.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.800]   How many people are bragging to you about how much money they made in cryptocurrency,
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:26.480]   maybe NFTs, maybe GameStop, AMC Theater, whatever growth stock.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.040]   And the reality is more people are making these gains.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.520]   It's not like they're making and losing it all.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.040]   People are making these multi-bagger home runs.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.360]   And so people have learned from the past, the 2000.com era, where they're not just going
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.920]   to round trip it to zero, like what they did with Webvan or Pets.com.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.480]   They're going to turn it into a real asset.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:54.040]   And so that real asset is going to be real estate, art, maybe nice watches, jewelry,
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.180]   whatever it is.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.880]   That money is going to flow through to real assets.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   All right.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.800]   Asset number 12.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.120]   Credit is still very tight, which is why the housing market is probably not going to crash.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.800]   It was like pulling teeth refinancing my mortgage in 2019.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.440]   I think it took three months, at least two months, but I think it was like three months.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.440]   It was so painful.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.780]   They just asked for more and more dockets, more and more proof.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:27.200]   And I had a good amount of assets with the bank that I was refinancing with, and they
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   didn't care.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   And it felt like, I don't know, an intruder.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.680]   And then in 2020, when I got pre-approved for my mortgage, that took about three weeks
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.760]   versus two weeks on average.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.680]   And going through that process is also very, very arduous.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.360]   But because I was pre-approved, I already went through a lot of the pain.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.080]   So it was just like updating the documents.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:55.400]   But getting a mortgage or refinancing a mortgage is not, it hasn't been easy since the global
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.300]   financial crisis.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.840]   The average credit score to get a mortgage is over 720.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:09.600]   And if you look at mortgage originations by credit score, the dominant credit score level
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.360]   for getting mortgages is 760 plus.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.840]   760 plus is excellent, folks.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.660]   I was trying to get my refinance on my new mortgage.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.000]   They said I could only get the best rate if I had 800 plus.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.920]   And I was just at the tip there.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   I was like 808 or 810.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.160]   I mean, I don't know how to control my credit score.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.360]   I don't purposely try to make it better.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.680]   I just live my life and pay my bills.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.900]   But it was not easy.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.160]   And so if you look at this chart on my website, you'll notice that basically something like
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:47.440]   80% plus of mortgage originations are for people with credit scores above 720.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.320]   So if you have a credit score above 720, it should mean that you have reasonably good
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   finances.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.720]   You haven't foreclosed before or gone bankrupt and stuff like that.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:05.680]   And if you add to the fact that incomes have been rising and home equity has been rising,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.920]   it's just hard to see people with good credit and good jobs and good financials let go of
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.600]   their properties for fire sale prices.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.040]   All right, reason number 13, rents are rebounding in big cities.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.640]   Rents have been doing well in 18 hour cities, but in 24 hour cities like Manhattan, New
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.680]   York, rents are coming back, baby.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:32.960]   I did write a post back in October 2020, highlighting how the demand for a single family home I
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.560]   was renting out was very, very strong.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.560]   In the past, I would only get roommates.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.840]   You know, it was four bedrooms.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.240]   I would only get like four dudes.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.360]   It's always four dudes in San Francisco.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:47.680]   But this time it was families looking again, because it's that migration west in my city,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.360]   where it's less expensive, less dense, less crowded and more affordable.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:57.000]   So bubble concerns, you know, that is legitimate.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.600]   If prices keep on going up and rents go down, that means valuations are going up, right.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.120]   But now you are clearly seeing rents rebound in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Seattle,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.600]   New York, Washington, DC, they're rebounding and they're going to get tighter and tighter.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.180]   Everybody is rushing back.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.680]   The herd is coming back, just like the herd left.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   I know a lot of people who decided to go and live with their parents to save on rent and
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.880]   also to spend more time with their parents.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.160]   That's a win win.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.440]   And they're like, you know what, I'm going to come back and do independent living again.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.660]   And it's really tightening the rental market.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.160]   So that's good for rental property owners.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.600]   All right, let's talk about reason number 14.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.860]   The cost to build housing is rising.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:48.240]   You may have heard that lumber prices are up 3x in one year as demand outstrips supply.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.960]   Therefore, framing costs to build a house are up at least 2x as lumber accounts for
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.800]   70% of framing costs.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.820]   And then there's labor costs.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:02.280]   My guy who, you know, has been working with me for five years is charging me 50% more
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.420]   now.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.060]   And it's because demand is so high.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:11.320]   So if it costs more to build a home, it's really hard to imagine scenario where prices
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.560]   start declining because people have to cover their costs.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.720]   Otherwise, they won't build and they won't sell their home.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.560]   And also, it's harder than ever to get a building permit now.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.560]   It's kind of nuts.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:30.000]   I've been waiting for three months, more than three months to get my building permit because
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.320]   San Francisco building and planning department is all backed up thanks to COVID.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.480]   And thanks to, I would say, inefficiencies by that department.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.960]   And it's just really maddening.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.360]   So if that's backed up, it's hard to get a permit.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.600]   You know, it's harder to get supply on the market.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.080]   And so that's another reason why I think price is going to continue to do well.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.280]   And then finally, reason number 15, why housing market won't crash.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.680]   Selling costs are still too high, right?
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.400]   It still costs 5% on average now to sell a home.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.920]   Whereas it now costs $0 to sell a stock.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.940]   Whether the stock is worth $100 or $3,000 plus like Amazon.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.640]   You know, if the cost to sell a home dropped to zero, or let's say not zero, right?
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   Because that's not realistic.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:27.040]   Let's say it becomes a flat cost or the commission goes down to, let's say, 3% or 2%.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:32.240]   The amount of supply that will come on the market would be much greater.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.520]   I think there'd be tons more supply.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:40.380]   Therefore, the real estate industry is actually self-throttling, which is beneficial for homeowners
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.040]   who never sell.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.560]   In addition to high real estate selling commissions, there's also the cost to prepare the home
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.260]   for sale.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.600]   These costs include painting, refinishing the floors, staging, so forth.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.840]   There's also transfer taxes, recording taxes.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.160]   It is a pain in the butt to sell a home.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.840]   You've got to be pretty motivated to sell a home during the pandemic, one.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.920]   And two, you've got to be, I don't know, there has to be some kind of life event.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.600]   Divorce, you're changing your life, you're moving across country, you're going to go
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.160]   to Hawaii, you're going to go to Thailand.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.900]   Something that really has to motivate you to sell a home.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:21.480]   So thank goodness the real estate industry has kept commissions so high.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.760]   Otherwise, volume would probably explode.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:30.080]   All right, now that you have my 15 reasons why I don't think the housing market is going
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.680]   to crash anytime soon, the question is, should you buy now or when should you buy now?
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.600]   I believe ideally the best time to buy property is when you can afford it and when you can
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.340]   stay somewhere for 10 years.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.340]   That's ideal.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.200]   Whether you can afford it is based off, I think, my 30/33 rule for home buying.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   Check it out.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.520]   The easy rule is to spend no more than three times your household income on a house.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.600]   You can probably stretch it to 5x, 5x your household income given rates are so low, but
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.720]   don't go beyond that.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:09.400]   Another good time to buy is during the winter months because anybody listing during December,
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   the bad weather, holidays, is generally more motivated than someone who can just wait for
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.760]   the great weather in the spring and when people are more motivated to buy.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.920]   And then the other time could be when the moratoriums end.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.240]   That could be in September or sometime in the second half of 2021.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.360]   It could be kicking the can down the road.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:35.680]   And the idea is if the moratoriums end, more people lose their homes.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.280]   It's that simple because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage or the renters can't afford
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.640]   to pay their rent.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.680]   And then the landlord has to basically eat all the costs of them foreclose.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.200]   And banks are probably licking their chops to see a lot of foreclosures.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   Why?
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.640]   Because the housing market is on fire.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:01.280]   The housing market has done well over the past many years now, but especially during
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   the pandemic.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:08.880]   So if you're a bank, you're thinking to yourself, "Hmm, if you foreclose or you can't pay your
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:14.320]   mortgage, I'm going to be able to take over the home for cheap and then resell it at a
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.960]   higher premium."
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:22.400]   As a capitalist, you know the senior bankers at these lending companies are thinking about
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   this.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.720]   They don't want to get into the home ownership, buying and selling business.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:33.120]   But there's a huge arbitrage here where they could just assume a lot of homes and then
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.920]   just resell it because there's a huge amount of institutional demand.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:43.600]   So as a retail buyer, what you can do is try to stack cash, save your money for that down
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:51.840]   payment so that potentially there might be an uptick in supply in fourth quarter of 2021
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.800]   or first quarter of 2022, where you can take advantage.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.080]   You're probably going to be competing against the institutional investors and everybody
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:05.240]   else who has a similar idea, but it's as good of a time as any if you're not going to be
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.840]   buying now.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.200]   And the final time to buy might be the summer.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.280]   Summer is usually the slow period because vacation, right?
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.480]   Summer vacation and kids are not in school.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.320]   So if people are all on the beach somewhere, maybe there's just less demand.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.240]   Every single market, doesn't matter if it's a bull or bear market, there's always an opportunity.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.720]   You just have to go find it, whether it's a stale fish listing, it's a mispriced listing,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.760]   it's a bad time listing where it's out of town real estate agent who has no Rolodex,
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.000]   no connections.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.400]   There's always an opportunity.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.320]   And again, try not to be the winning bidder out of a mega bidding frenzy.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.360]   It's generally not the right way to go.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:56.560]   All right, everybody, I hope you enjoyed this episode about my favorite asset class to build
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   wealth.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.680]   I'm going to be monitoring the housing market like a hawk.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.520]   Again, given 40% of my net worth is geared towards housing.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.040]   And I think it's going to do well, it's going to have its ups and downs.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.880]   But you know what, you don't really care as much as a real estate investor because you
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.160]   don't see the daily price movements.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.560]   Thank goodness you can just wake up years from now and be like, okay, it's done good.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.560]   Good.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.760]   All right, I'm going to try to do more episodes going forward.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:31.400]   But at the same time, I'm also trying to get myself out of doing more online.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.520]   I just want to really do less.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.720]   And I'm really focused on just taking it down as things get better in the economy.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.960]   And I hope you guys do too.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.720]   You know, don't try to grind so hard anymore.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.860]   Really try to find more balance.
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.160]   If the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that life is precious and that we need to
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.680]   focus on more important things like our relationships and our friendships and our health.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.440]   So I really wish you guys the best of luck in your real estate search.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   And if you enjoyed this podcast, gosh, it took a while to record.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.540]   But I'd appreciate a positive comment and a review.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.540]   And I'll see you guys around.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:07.560]   Thanks so much.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.700]   Thanks so much.
