[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.760]   In this episode, I have with me a special guest, Dr. Daniel Shin from the Darwinian
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.760]   Doctor.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.760]   Say hello.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.760]   Hey, Sam.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   Really happy to be here.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.760]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.320]   So, Daniel, you started your site a couple years ago or no, maybe four or five years
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.800]   ago after you became a doctor.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.120]   It's interesting to me that I've seen a proliferation of doctors who are writing about personal
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.480]   finance when I was thinking to myself, "Why not just focus on being a doctor and make
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.160]   a lot of good doctor money, save, invest, and then you'll be set, good to go for the
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.720]   next -- for the rest of your life after, let's say, 20 years?"
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.800]   What inspired you to start your site as well as start a TikTok site and all this other
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.800]   stuff?
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.000]   I mean, there's a lot of credit that I think we have to give to Jim Dolley, who is the
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.840]   founder of the White Coat Investor blog.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.240]   He's, I would say, considered by many to be sort of the progenitor of a lot of the physician
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.320]   finance blogs.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.360]   But I think for me, it was more than just wanting to sort of copy that model.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.880]   A couple of years into becoming a surgeon, it was really interesting for me because you
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.840]   have to understand that for doctors, you go for literally over a decade trying to achieve
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.360]   this goal of becoming a physician.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.960]   It goes through college, through medical school, and through residency training, which for
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.200]   some people is as short as three years, but for most people can be four or five.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.080]   In my case, it was six years of residency training.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.120]   So you're talking about like a 14-year journey to become an attending.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.080]   Then you get there, and all of a sudden, that's something that you're supposed to do for the
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.000]   next 30 or 40 or maybe even 50 years in some cases.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.200]   So that was my experience.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.040]   And then the first year or two was this incredible period of learning new skills and getting
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.240]   comfortable with being sort of in charge of my own medical direction.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.100]   But then just a couple of years in, I went through this interesting period where I felt
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.760]   very secure in being a surgeon.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.680]   I was good at my job.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.760]   My patients loved me.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.640]   I had a low complication rate.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.000]   I felt that I was very good.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.920]   And then I was looking and thinking about my life, and I didn't see any obvious goals
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.520]   or outlets for all the energy that I still had.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   And I think a lot of physicians kind of go through this, where you kind of reach the
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.840]   top of the hill, and then you look around, and then you just stay there.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.600]   You're supposed to stay there for decades.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.680]   And in my case, I sort of wanted a creative outlet.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.760]   I thought that would be a good way of keeping life interesting.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.200]   So I started the blog as sort of a creative outlet.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.080]   I've always loved writing.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.800]   And in terms of goals, I fixated on the goal of financial independence as a new goal, because
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   I thought that was one that would be very interesting.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   And I thought it would be interesting writing about the ways that I was trying to achieve
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   that.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.400]   So that was really the start of my blog.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.560]   It was a number of reasons, but it was for a creative outlet, and it was also to have
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.960]   sort of a new vehicle to express my goals.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   Got it.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.120]   Yeah, I remember working in finance.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.200]   And the only reason why I started Financial Samurai in 2009 was because I thought I was
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.240]   going to get laid off, and I needed something else to do, because it was pretty dicey times
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   then.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.640]   How many years were you as a attending-- not attending, or what's it called?
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.640]   Just a-- Attending, yeah.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.240]   Just a practicing doctor before you started.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.480]   And you hear all these stories about long hours during residency, and then a stressful
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.520]   job being a surgeon.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   Did you do surgery?
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.080]   Yeah, yeah, urologic surgery.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.240]   So I treat sort of surgical conditions of the urinary tract.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   So if you get a kidney stone, you'll call someone like me to come take care of it, and
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   you'll be-- we'll both be very happy once you're through that experience, because it's
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   very painful.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   Got it.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   And isn't that a long and stressful day, usually?
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.840]   At this time, there was a lot of things about my job that were great, but a number of things
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   that were not so great.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.600]   I was working 50 to 60 hours a week baseline, just doing my job.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.160]   And then at the time, I lived in Southern California.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.600]   I lived in Los Angeles and practiced down in Orange County near Disneyland.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   So I was driving literally 2 to 2 and 1/2 hours every day just in the Southern California
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   traffic.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   So I was feeling burnt out.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.840]   And it was interesting, because burnout, traditionally, you would think of someone in their 50s working
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.840]   really hard.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.640]   And they've been doing it for decades as a physician.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.420]   And in my case-- and I think, actually, a lot of physicians nowadays, we're finding
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.360]   burnout earlier than we used to.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.160]   And that was the case for me.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.440]   Interesting, because I think part of becoming a physician or getting to the top of any type
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.960]   of well-paying field is to have the endurance to keep on going no matter what.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.280]   And do you think there's some kind of disconnect in terms of the people who are in medical
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.640]   school thinking about what life will be like as a physician versus what happens and what
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.760]   life is like after they get there?
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.800]   And I think this has always been the case, except that now people feel more empowered
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   to talk about it.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.440]   We're in this world of social media where there's a lot more openness and transparency.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.000]   But I think the term that we're looking for is arrival fallacy.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.040]   And a lot of people work towards a goal, and they expect that once they achieve that goal,
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.320]   their life's going to be incredible.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.200]   And it's going to stay that way.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.620]   But I think we're very adaptable creatures.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.240]   So once we reach a goal, it's great for a little bit of time.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.520]   And then all of a sudden, you're saying, "Oh, this is just life now."
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.340]   So you're sort of searching for that next thing all the time.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.000]   Did you have some pressure to become a doctor?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.640]   Because I remember in high school, I knew there were some of the kids who wanted to
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.120]   be doctors very early on.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.480]   Our salutatorian became a doctor, and he was always very smart.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.920]   And I was like, "No, I can't get those trade As.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.920]   Nope, not me."
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.480]   But he also went to William & Mary, and then he went to medical school.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.880]   I just knew I couldn't do it.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.140]   So did you have some kind of predetermined view of being a doctor?
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.960]   How did you decide to be a doctor?
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.240]   I mean, I'm Korean.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   So when I was growing up, there were sort of a few professions that seemed to be an
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.120]   option for me.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.640]   And it's not like my mom sat me down and said, "Okay, Dan, you can become a doctor, a lawyer,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.640]   or an engineer."
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.800]   But in church, that was sort of what the other Korean moms would brag about.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.880]   And after a time, becoming a physician actually did seem something like I was really interested
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.760]   in because I didn't have a very good understanding of what people did in "finance."
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   And I think that's something that you can talk about and how you ended up going into
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   there.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.920]   But for me, I sort of understood what doctors did.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.440]   It's like doctors help people get better, and doctors are respected, and doctors make
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   a good living.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.280]   And all of these things sort of seem to make sense.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.760]   And when I started college, yeah, I basically started out with the goal of becoming a physician.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.920]   And I sort of meandered a little bit.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.160]   I took some time off in college.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:46.740]   I did other things and eventually did come back to pre-med and eventually went to med
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.560]   school, and that sort of became the goal.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   Got it.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.360]   Where did you go to undergrad and medical school?
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.560]   So I went to undergrad at Yale University.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.720]   And then afterwards, I was a philosophy major there, so I had a couple of pre-med requirements
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.480]   that I still had when I graduated.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.920]   So after that, I did a year at Penn, just kind of finishing up med requirements.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.200]   And then I went to the University of Pittsburgh for medical school.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.320]   And then I did six years of urology residency at USC in LA.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   So that's interesting.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.560]   So getting into Yale is kind of impossible nowadays.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.960]   What do you think enabled you to get into Yale?
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.800]   And then how did you feel going from Yale to Pittsburgh Medical School?
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:42.000]   So I think about this, and it's one of my favorite conversations these days, talking
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   about other--
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.800]   So I went to Yale, my wife went to Yale, her sisters went to Yale.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.960]   So when we get together on family vacations, we kind of sit around and say, oh, are kids
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   ever going to get into Yale?
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.160]   It's so much harder now.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.680]   We talk about these things, right?
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   And then there's been recent things in the news about affirmative action and legacy and
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   all that stuff.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:07.080]   But I think the thing, when I look back, I did work really hard in high school.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.320]   I was valedictorian.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   I got straight As.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.400]   I got a 1540 on the SATs.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.600]   I was drum major.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   I did track.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.000]   I was in student government.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.320]   I did all sorts of stuff.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.120]   And I went to governor's school.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.000]   So I mean, I did work really hard early on.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.560]   And when I got into Yale, I was incredibly happy and grateful.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.080]   And I think that even when you do all those things, even when you check off the boxes,
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.240]   it's still a crapshoot.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.320]   Because acceptance rates are low now, but they were low back then as well.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.140]   And I think a lot of things kind of have to go right.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.200]   And I just got lucky.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.560]   I don't know if you got lucky.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.200]   Because if you did all those things like governor's school, I didn't even know what governor's
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.160]   school was in high school.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.840]   They seem like you did a lot of things.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.240]   So did your parents say, "Hey, you need to get into one of these schools when you're
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.560]   at a young age," or were you self-motivated?
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.760]   I think it was both, honestly.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.440]   And I've talked about this and written about this on the blog a lot.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.120]   But my family struggled financially for a significant part of my childhood.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:22.900]   I mean, when I was very young, in the '80s, my dad was working in real estate in Manhattan
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.800]   and as kind of a commercial broker.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   And things were quite good.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.600]   But then there was a recession.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.680]   And then his entire sort of livelihood dried up.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:38.720]   And pretty much from middle school onwards, we really struggled financially to a point
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.560]   where at times my mom was worried about just buying us food for dinner.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:51.200]   And it coincided with a time when I was starting to realize what was going on as I was getting
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   older.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.160]   And I could tell that one ticket to financial stability was to go to a good college and
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.280]   get a good job.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.720]   So that did motivate me.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:12.400]   I think that also my parents, I have to give them a lot of credit because I think one thing
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.800]   that they did convince me of, and I don't know how much was internal versus external,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.200]   but they said, "Look, you're smart.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.520]   You have a lot of potential and you should try to fulfill that potential."
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.840]   And it's something that sort of I still believe in.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.160]   And I believe for all people that if you have abilities and if you have talents, you should
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   share them with the world.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.300]   You should try to achieve to the limits of your potential.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.880]   And I think that did sort of instill that self-motivation that helped me to achieve
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.760]   both in high school, college, med school, et cetera.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.680]   What do you think the percentage split is between genetics, smarts, natural ability,
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.680]   and work ethic?
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:58.480]   And just two variables in terms of getting into college and having a successful career.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.200]   So this is a really loaded conversation, right?
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.180]   Because I think that getting into college is, there's so many factors that have to go
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.180]   right.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:12.500]   I do think that even though my family struggled with money, they from a very early age invested
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.700]   in my education.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:22.360]   So when we were choosing between buying new shoes and getting cumon, like math lessons,
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:29.460]   my mom and my dad would choose lessons and all these things that they felt that were
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.860]   going to be important in getting ahead.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:37.420]   So I think a lot of it is sort of the environment in which you were raised, which is related
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.340]   to privilege and sort of education and all that.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.420]   Genetics I think do have a correlation with IQ, right?
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:52.560]   But something that I am realizing more in my 30s and 40s is that pure intelligence only
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   gets you so far in life.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.740]   And I do think that at the extremes it can kind of work against you, but so many of the
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.060]   really successful people that I see nowadays and the people that I admire, they didn't
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.540]   go to the best colleges.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.300]   And if they did the SATs, maybe they wouldn't get what I got, but they have other skills
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.380]   that are in life that are even more useful.
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.140]   Like they're incredible with people, they can relate to people, they can motivate people,
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.180]   they can communicate.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.200]   And all these things I think can be even more important than pure intelligence.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.580]   So I got to lock you down on an exact percentage here because this is like a quiz here.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.740]   So that would be, I guess, nurture what you're talking about.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.980]   So give me a percentage because there's only two variables and then we figure out one variable,
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.980]   we know the other.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:42.240]   So in terms of genetics and nature, what do you think that percentage is?
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.700]   In terms of your success, determining your success in life, getting ahead.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.940]   Genetics versus nurture, so nature versus nurture?
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.960]   Correct.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   I'm going to go 50/50.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.260]   50/50, that's the safe bet.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.700]   It's a safe bet, but it's so true because you see these people who are clearly, clearly
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.440]   smart, right?
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.800]   Some people are too smart.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:27.480]   I was talking to someone's father, an incredibly smart guy, and he said that from the age of
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:34.140]   five he looked around and realized he was smarter than everyone, including adults, that
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.680]   he was encountering, right?
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:42.980]   And to him, I think that obviously in certain aspects of his career, that was a luxury because
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.660]   he could do computations, he could have insight into various problems.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.900]   But in a lot of ways, I think that worked against him because he was very bored and
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:57.460]   very isolated as a child because he saw himself as just different, right?
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.300]   It wasn't necessarily that he was better.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.860]   I think it just kind of isolated him.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:11.940]   So on the other hand, a lot of people who maybe aren't the smartest, but they have those
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.880]   skills that we talked about, they're definitely going to go farther and have gone farther
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.820]   in life than people like that.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.140]   And it's definitely a mix.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.220]   And you see the success of very, very wealthy kids, right?
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.140]   And maybe they're not the smartest, but they were supported and continue to be supported
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.720]   by their family who might have a lot of resources, and I would consider that nurture, right?
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.480]   So I think that more and more I'm realizing pure smarts will only get you so far.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.560]   You have to have that support if you want to succeed in life as well.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.480]   And one can make up for the other.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.960]   >>No, you're absolutely right.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.880]   It's always interesting because as a parent, I'm thinking to myself, how much effort should
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.380]   I put into parenting and how much are they just going to figure it out on their own?
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.200]   So you have kids, right, Daniel?
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   >>Yeah.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   I've got a five-year-old and a nine-year-old.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.920]   They're two boys.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.520]   >>And when you think about them going to college, how do you see that?
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.400]   What if they don't get into Yale?
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:25.460]   >>So they're young, and who knows how the next 10 years are going to go.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.080]   But I would love for them to go to Yale.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.240]   It's like I had an incredible experience, and when I got there, I realized that I wasn't
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.720]   the smartest person in the room.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.640]   I was surrounded by all these people who were incredibly accomplished and interesting and
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.120]   much, much better than me in a lot of ways.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.280]   I think in a lot of ways, I focused so much on academics in high school that I stunted
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   my social growth.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:54.000]   So it wasn't until literally first or second year of med school that I was like, I think
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.920]   I kind of get this whole social thing now.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.920]   So I was like president of my med school class and things like that because finally, I felt
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.200]   like I sort of got it, how everyone relates and everything like that.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:10.720]   But in college, when I first started out, I was behind, absolutely, in terms of social
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.240]   interaction and all that stuff.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.880]   When I think about that for my kids, I think there's so many factors that go into it.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.640]   I would love for them to go to Yale.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:27.800]   And when I think about them objectively right now, I think they're both very smart.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.820]   But again, that only gets you so far.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:36.240]   So smart plus lazy will not get you as far as smart plus very determined.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.520]   So I'd love for them to go to Yale, but I think that they're going to be successful
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.520]   regardless.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.520]   >> Okay.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:49.440]   I guess I asked this question because you decided to go to medical school and be a doctor
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.040]   and do that route.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:58.080]   And there seemed to have been a dissatisfaction that fell upon you just not too long after
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.400]   you started working, despite the income, despite the status and all that.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.280]   So would you want them to go through that same path?
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.680]   And how do you think you would have done things differently if you knew then what you know
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680]   now?
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:19.960]   >> So I would start out by saying that I'm incredibly grateful to the medical path that
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   I did.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:28.200]   Because even now, I'm spending about a quarter to a third of my time in medicine still.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:34.440]   I do locum tendens urology, which is I kind of visit places and help them fill a specific
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   need.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.980]   And I travel around and do that.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:43.920]   And I spend the rest of my time in business like real estate and the blog and content
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.600]   creation and all that.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.720]   And I am incredibly grateful because I never would have had the freedom to do this if I
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   hadn't gone through medical training and had that very high income to sort of give me the
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.000]   freedom to do all this stuff.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   But you're right.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.880]   I mean, if I had to think about it for my kids, I would not recommend them to go into
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.600]   medicine, certainly not surgery.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:14.000]   Because the six years of training that I had to do to become a surgeon, I came out very
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   well trained.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.120]   But it was torture.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.480]   It was 80-hour plus weeks.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.360]   One week I hit, I think, 120 hours or something like that.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.040]   It was ridiculous, right?
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   And there's so much life that you give up along the way in medical training.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.440]   And honestly, the equation of medicine for physicians today is very different from what
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.860]   it was 20 years ago.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.540]   There's much less autonomy.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.320]   Most physicians now are employed.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.080]   Most physicians now are burnt out.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:57.120]   And these are well documented in surveys that have been done throughout the pandemic.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.360]   And certainly things are worse now than they were just three or four years ago because
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.680]   of the pandemic.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.080]   But this is well documented.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.880]   So you're talking about a physician workforce now that is in more debt than they used to
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   be.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.120]   They're more burnt out than they used to be.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.200]   And they have a lot less control over their lives.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.920]   So if I were to recommend to my kids what I would want them to do with their lives,
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.200]   I would want them to do something where they have complete control over their schedule.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.480]   So entrepreneurship and business, I think, offer that.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:36.240]   And they're a lot of the reason why I chose in 2018, 2019, as I was going through this
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.920]   creative process with the blog and figuring out how to get to financial independence,
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:46.760]   I decided to shift towards investing and real estate because I felt like that was the path.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:52.680]   And to get that life of autonomy where you can decide exactly what to do with your week,
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   that's how you get there.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.840]   You don't do it by having a traditional job where you beholden to an employer.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:02.240]   Well, it definitely helps, though, to have that foundation of income and your learning
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.800]   so you can have those savings to invest.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:11.720]   It's an interesting journey that I think many people wonder from the outside looking in.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.360]   Doctors, they make good money.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.800]   So let's talk about money because you were open about that with TikTok and how much you
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   made.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.200]   So can you give listeners an idea of how much you made as a resident and then how much you
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.840]   made your path over the next five years and then why you shifted from moving from Southern
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.200]   California to Tennessee?
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.520]   Sure.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:39.040]   So I think people know this now because a lot of people like on TikTok and are very
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.880]   transparent about resident salaries.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.360]   But residents and these are training doctors, they are physicians, they have an MD, they
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.920]   finish medical school, but they're kind of learning their specialty.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.080]   You can make anywhere from like $45,000 a year to $70,000 a year.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.640]   I think that's really typical as a resident.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.040]   And you do that for three years.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.720]   You do that for six years or seven years in some cases.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.280]   And you're working, remember, probably about 80 hours a week, depending on your specialty.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.720]   Doesn't seem safe working eight hours a week if you're actually doing some surgery.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.120]   What do you think?
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:26.320]   I think that it is not ideal, but it's the way that medical training is created.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.520]   And is it safe?
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.040]   So we kind of had a rule in residency.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:42.520]   And if you're safe to drive, you're safe to operate, to do surgery.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.880]   I think the problem is that now they've shown that being sleep deprived is equivalent to
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.040]   like drinking X number of beers.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   And certainly after being on call for 36 hours, which we did routinely, I would drive home
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   and I crashed.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.400]   I actually crashed once in residency.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.000]   It was a fender bender, but I crashed.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.960]   And there were probably a hundred close calls where I almost crashed.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.360]   And this is because you're driving home and people say, "Oh, you should just like take
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.520]   a nap before you go home."
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.000]   And you don't understand.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.680]   After 36 hours in the hospital, you'll do anything to get out of there.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.800]   You just want to go home.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.520]   So you're not going to go to the call room and nap for 20 minutes because you just want
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520]   to go home.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.840]   So anyway, so it's not a deal.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.120]   So on the 36 hours, is that straight being awake or do you get an hour or two hours of
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.120]   sleep?
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.840]   It depends.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.800]   So many times it was being awake straight.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.440]   And this was in...
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.480]   So first year of general surgery, I was in-house call.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.640]   And that means that when you're on call, you're there because you have to be able to respond
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.160]   at a moment's notice to a car crash coming in.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.920]   And someone needing emergency surgery.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:08.160]   And I think in a lot of cases, it was so busy that you were awake the entire time.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.120]   And maybe you would sleep for like 15 minutes and your pager goes off and then you have
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.960]   to like call the nurse and say, "Yes, it's okay to give this guy Tylenol."
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.320]   Or, "Okay, thank you for telling me that he's constipated."
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.800]   You know, all these things.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.120]   So it depends on your specialty, but then after intern year, I was at home call.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.720]   So you can actually go home in some cases if you're not needed in the hospital.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.320]   But in residency, I was at the county hospital.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.840]   And when you're covering the county hospital, there's so many emergencies.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   A lot of the times you're at the hospital still 80% of the time.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.200]   And the trick about home call is that since you're not technically in-house, you work
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.440]   a normal day the next day.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:57.680]   So in a way, after intern year, things were better because if you got super lucky, maybe
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.800]   you didn't get called that much.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.160]   But in a way, it was harder because you were on call overnight, maybe spending the entire
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.040]   night in the emergency room or in the operating room, and then you work a full normal next
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   day.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   So you're just exhausted the entire day.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.440]   So pluses and minuses.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   >> Dr. Kim: Yeah.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.800]   I would say for listeners, I wouldn't want a resident to do any kind of big surgery on
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   me.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.080]   I'll ask them straight up, "How long have you been here?"
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.280]   Because I know for myself, after working, let's say, 10 hours, I'm dead and I'm done.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   I miss things.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.740]   I get in accidents, all that stuff.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.280]   So this seems like a problematic system.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   But go on.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.560]   So you're talking about 40,000 to 70,000 as a resident.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.400]   And then afterwards, what can you make or what are you making then?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.200]   >> Dr. Keltner: Right.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.720]   So urology is one of the better paid surgical specialties.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.360]   It's consistently in the top 10.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   And as an attending level urologist, after a few years, you're probably going to be making
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.080]   between $400,000 to $600,000 a year.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.160]   And when you start out for the first few years, depending if you're employed or if you're
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.920]   going into private practice, it might be significantly less.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.400]   Might be about $300,000.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:16.700]   But you can usually plan on making at least $400,000 as a urologist in our nation today.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:22.160]   And then some urologists on the upper ends of the earning spectrum may earn a million
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.160]   dollars.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.560]   That's rare, but it can happen.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.560]   >> Dr. Insane: Okay.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.200]   So that's pretty good money, $400,000 to $600,000.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.040]   And I'm assuming there's a correlation with age and experience?
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.400]   >> Dr. Keltner: Yeah.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   Generally, you earn more.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.320]   You sort of increase in income as you're building your skill set, your salary, and/or your practice
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   if you're in private practice.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:49.020]   I would say for the first 10 years and then things kind of stabilize and plateau.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.280]   What I've learned as being out in the real world, there's a very big difference as an
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.700]   employed physician and someone in private practice because employed physicians generally
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.280]   have a very hard cap on how much they can make.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.540]   There's a salary and there can be a revenue bonus, whereas if you're incredibly productive,
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:13.340]   they'll sort of give you a certain bump, but it's tough to make a significant amount more
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.300]   as an employed physician.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.500]   In private practice, they're actually sort of like a hybrid between a doctor and a businessman,
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.940]   business people, because they have these ancillary income sources where they can make money from
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.940]   their lab.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.580]   They can make money from the surgical center.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:34.940]   This is all things that can help surgeons and other specialists sort of get to those
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.100]   upper income levels, but you have to be a savvy business person.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.100]   Right.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:44.060]   So, as a surgeon yourself, if you're not doing surgery, are you just not getting paid as
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.060]   much?
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.140]   You can be a consultant doctor and still make money?
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.740]   So, it really depends on your specialty.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.660]   Orthopedic surgery, if you're not doing surgery, you're not making money.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.180]   They try to spend all their time in the operating room because that's, first of all, a lot of
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.720]   people break bones, so that's where they're needed.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.020]   That's where the need is, but also that's where they make money.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.900]   In urology, it's a little different actually.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:14.900]   So, a lot of the ways urologic surgeons actually make the most money generally in the clinic
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:20.900]   doing diagnostic scopes and things that are outside of the operating room because they're
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.900]   much more time efficient.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.140]   So, you could do a lot more quick procedures in the clinic or in the surgery center than
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.740]   you can in the main operating room with full anesthesia and all these other costs.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.540]   So, it's very dependent on the specialty.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.660]   So, when you were in residency, when was your light bulb moment to say, "I want to be a
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:45.100]   urologist who helps mostly men maybe get their kidney stones out of their bodies?"
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.620]   What was that epiphany moment like?
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.620]   It was actually, I remember it well.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.060]   It was third year of … Actually, no.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.860]   So, third year was when I did my first rotation, but the epiphany moment was in second year
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.300]   when a urologist came and gave us a lecture.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.260]   When you're in medical school, you get a lot of specialists who come in and say, "This
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.860]   is what I do and you can do this too."
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:15.220]   He showed a video of laser lithotripsy, which is one of the ways that we treat kidney stones.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:22.340]   You put a tiny little camera up the bladder to the kidney and the patients usually sleep
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.340]   almost all the time.
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.340]   Okay.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.340]   Thank God.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:34.940]   So, you use a fiber optic fiber to deliver laser energy to break kidney stones.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.500]   When you see videos of this, it looks like a video game.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.540]   When I saw that, I was like, "That looks awesome."
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:47.460]   Still, it's one of the most fun things you can do as a urologist, break kidney stones.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.500]   I thought that I would be very good at it and that I would like doing it and that was
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.500]   true.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.060]   I had this rotation spot open in the beginning of third year.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.060]   I just filled it with urology.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.460]   It was my first third year rotation and I loved it because I learned that urology is
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.580]   not only kidney stones.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.660]   You also cure cancer.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.060]   You can cure kidney cancer.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.620]   You can cure bladder cancer.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.500]   You could help people urinate better and you could help men have better sex and things
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   like this.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:21.280]   A lot of these things are great because you're curing cancer, but a lot of the satisfaction
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.780]   that you get as a urologist is helping people with these very basic things because you don't
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:32.100]   understand how good you have it if you're urinating normally and so you can't pee normally.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.860]   Then you'll do anything to get back to normal urination.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.540]   A lot of these things, you're helping people get back to themselves and they're very thankful.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.860]   That was what brought me to urology.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:51.040]   I know as men, as we get older, we need to start peeing more at night.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.840]   What percentage of your patients are older?
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:31:00.480]   It seems like AGE is a huge variable for having these problems.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:08.880]   I would say the majority of your typical urology patient is probably 60 to 70 years old and
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   male.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.600]   We do treat a lot of females too because men and women get kidney cancer and kidney stones
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:20.000]   and bladder cancer, but the majority of our patients are men for sure.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.680]   Do you have any advice for those of us who are not 60 or 70 or 60 or 70 to try to be
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.400]   more preventative so we don't see you?
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.760]   Sure.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.360]   The number one thing that you can do, you can't really do much about getting an enlarged
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   prostate.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   It's genetic.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.320]   It's autosomal dominant, usually passed down through your father, et cetera.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:47.680]   But you can drink plenty of water and stay hydrated because that's going to stop you
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.440]   from getting kidney stones.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.520]   If you have any predisposition towards it, like your parents have kidney stones or anything
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.400]   like that, you should probably be drinking between two and three liters of water a day
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.140]   and that's going to dilute your urine.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.140]   You remember science, right?
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.880]   If you have something that's diluted, you're not going to form as many crystals.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.360]   You're not going to crystallize.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.280]   So that's how it works in the kidneys as well.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   Okay.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.840]   So let's say I'm a 78-year-old man who has to go to the bathroom every two hours.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:22.480]   Is it kind of too late for me and am I trying to just drink a lot of water during the day
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.560]   and have a certain cutoff point before I go to bed?
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.840]   I'm just trying to think about one person in particular to try to help him out.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.320]   So you're talking about lifestyle modification and that's always the first step.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.480]   So cut off fluids two or three hours before you go to bed.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:47.320]   That way your body has time to process it and that helps to a certain extent.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.880]   Once you sort of get beyond those things though, there's medication.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:56.400]   There's a very common medication that sort of relaxes the prostate and it helps you pee
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:02.680]   better and can kind of reduce those nighttime bladder overactivity issues.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   And then there's surgery.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   There's medication.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   What is that medication called?
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:12.840]   So they're called alpha blockers and there's medications like Tamsulosin which is one of
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:18.400]   the most common ones and there are a variety of them but Flomax is the most common one
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   you might hear of.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   Flomax.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   And have you ever encountered a situation where you would prescribe to your patient
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:31.360]   Flomax or whatever these alpha blockers are and then they would encounter a rejection
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   from the insurance company saying we are not going to cover that?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.080]   You know, they're very effective.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.640]   They've been around forever.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:44.520]   So generally your generic alpha blockers are going to be covered.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   They're super cheap.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   They're super cheap.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:52.280]   If the doc's prescribing an alpha blocker that's not covered, just tell him to stop
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   prescribing the flashiest thing and just prescribe one that is generic and cheap because there
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.760]   are plenty to choose from.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.760]   Okay.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   Good to know.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:07.600]   So we know one of the problems or issues that doctors face is declining insurance reimbursement
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.240]   rates that has hurt the income generating power of doctors.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.320]   Do you see that in your field?
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:27.800]   So this would be sort of an hour's long talk all to itself but the industry of medicine
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:34.560]   and healthcare in the United States is so messed up and it has gotten this way because
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.960]   of many different things.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:42.800]   But you could argue that, I think very convincingly, that the major reason is the for-profit insurance
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.760]   companies that basically control healthcare in the United States.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:55.160]   And anyone who wants to change it just gets drowned out by millions of dollars of lobbying.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.040]   So it would be much, much better for us to be in a single payer system, Medicare for
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   all.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   It would totally be better.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.400]   There'd be so many less people uncovered.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.160]   The baseline level of medical care in this country would go up.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:15.840]   I don't know if doctors would be happier but they might be.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.980]   It may limit the ability of some doctors to make stratospheric levels of income but it's
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:26.200]   no doubt in my mind that from a public health perspective, there shouldn't be single payer
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.520]   or universal healthcare.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.960]   We're the only developed nation at our level that doesn't have it.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.880]   And everything from infant mortality to just like diabetes care and all these things would
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.000]   be so much better if we changed our system.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Got it.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Got it.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   It is interesting.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.960]   I remember when I left my day job in 2012 and then I no longer had health insurance
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.280]   provided because my wife left in 2015 when she was 35 as well.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.480]   So we were stuck and we had to buy our own health care insurance and at the time for
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.920]   two people, it was around $1,650 a month.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.480]   And I was thinking to myself, "Wow, this is like so expensive."
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.360]   And we had trouble getting reimbursements and coverage.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.440]   And so I said, "I'm just going to buy UnitedHealthcare stock and all these healthcare
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.840]   providers because they're just crushing us.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.720]   So if you're going to crush me, I'm going to at least invest in you guys."
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.640]   And these guys have been great investments.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:23.480]   Yeah, that was very smart of you to do because they're making tons of money.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.080]   And it's one of my...
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.320]   So I'm on TikTok as the Darwinian doctor and one of my favorite other doctors that I follow
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.720]   is Dr. Glockum Flecken.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:41.040]   It's a tough mouthful, but basically it's this ophthalmologist who produces these incredibly
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.000]   funny skits and he acts out all the characters.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.640]   But over the last few years, as he's grown in fame, he's found a voice criticizing for-profit
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.840]   health insurance.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.600]   And he goes into a lot of things.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.640]   It's like the pharmaceutical industry is messed up, for-profit health insurance is messed
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.440]   up and he summarizes it incredibly well.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:10.080]   But basically one of his recent skits basically highlights that insurance companies see you
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.320]   as a dollar sign.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:18.040]   And they want you to give them the most amount of money possible and then die.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.320]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.000]   To make way for other well-paying people.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.480]   And they don't actually want to cover stuff.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.760]   So a lot of times it's been well proven that a lot of times they'll automatically just
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.800]   deny coverage for various things just as a cost-saving measure.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.640]   And then it's just messed up.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   It's tough.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   It's tough.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.840]   We had an issue when our daughter ate too many eggs and we didn't know that she was
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.080]   allergic to eggs.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.440]   So she started swelling up and then the whole ambulance debacle was crazy.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.360]   I'm so thankful that they came in time of need.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.360]   But then the 20-minute ride was $3,800.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.080]   And we're like, "What?
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.080]   Come on.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.080]   $3,800."
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.880]   So it's almost like the consumers are afraid, afraid to get medical coverage because they
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.800]   don't know exactly how much coverage the insurance company is going to pay or how much is going
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.400]   to come out of their pocket.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.920]   So there's a lot of fear in terms of I'm sure there's a lot of undiagnosed people who are
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.120]   suffering because of the cost of health insurance.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.960]   That is so true.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.480]   And I think there's a lot of attention now to it.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:29.760]   And it's so entrenched that you've got this entrenched healthcare, pharmaceutical industry,
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.240]   insurance complex.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.960]   And it's hard to know how that's ever going to change.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.320]   But you have this growing discontent among all the citizens of this country that are
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.080]   like, "This is messed up.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.920]   We should have better healthcare."
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.080]   And it's almost like going to come to a head in some way.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.940]   Who knows how doctors end up on that.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:53.280]   So a lot of me diversifying my income by investing has been sort of hedging my bets because who
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.400]   knows what's going to happen to healthcare in this country.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:59.900]   You might as well have other sources of income, other investments, other than just working
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.400]   as a physician.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.920]   Right.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.840]   Tell us about your move to Tennessee because it seems unconventional.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.520]   I know from a doctor's perspective you can make more in lower population cities around
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.520]   the country, but I don't think you moved for that reason.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.720]   Why did you move from Southern California, which is sunny and nice and glamorous, to
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.280]   what part of Tennessee are you in now?
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.240]   I'm in Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.640]   Okay.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:33.480]   So basically my move from Southern California to Memphis, it was a number of things coming
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.460]   to a head.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:44.280]   After six years with my medical group in Southern California, I basically made it, or I tried
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.160]   to optimize it as much as possible.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.040]   I had a Tesla, so the commute was much better.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.960]   I was chief of my department, so I felt a lot more sort of ownership and autonomy in
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.400]   my day to day.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:40:01.720]   But again, I've been disillusioned with healthcare to a lot of extent, and I love practicing
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.800]   medicine, but there are a lot of downsides of being a doctor, right?
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.000]   You know, covering a call and all these things.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:15.340]   And I also, by that point, had a large and growing business of real estate, right?
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:20.320]   So I had a portfolio that I was managing in my spare time on the weekends, and I was additionally
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:25.920]   writing the blog and creating short form video content and all these things, and I loved
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   that stuff.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.880]   That was fun for me and also interesting, and I wanted more time for that.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.840]   And I didn't really see an ideal way out, right?
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.720]   So a lot of my time was spent kind of wondering about this and wondering where I was going
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   to go.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:47.520]   But then my wife, who is in the museum field, basically was recruited to lead the museum
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:54.880]   in Memphis, and this was sort of at a crossroads for her, where either she could continue doing
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.280]   her museum job in LA, which she was very good at and they loved her, or she could take a
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:07.440]   leap and try to make this big career step and it could potentially go great.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.000]   So we basically decided that for both of us, we were about 40 at the time, it was about
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.020]   a year ago, and we're like, "This is the time to make a leap like this," right?
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:24.240]   We had thankfully saved a lot of money, invested well, so financially we're stable, and we
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.640]   were at a point where even if we made this move and everything went horribly, we could
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   start over.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   We're young enough.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.600]   But we figured our kids were young enough, we're at a point in our careers where it was
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.920]   time to do something like this.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.360]   And I think most people sort of don't want to do that.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.520]   They want to just keep the status quo, and they'll just grit it out, and they'll do it
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.160]   for 20 years, 30 years, and then retire, and then live for 14 years and then die because
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.160]   that's what happens.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:55.240]   But for us, we're like, the trajectory of our lives, I have this goal of where I want
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   us to be, and it's this vision of freedom and growth and contribution to society.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:07.220]   And I thought that we had a much better chance of getting there if we took a leap like this.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.360]   So she took the job.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.400]   I told my medical group that I was quitting.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.400]   And then since then, we've relocated here.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.480]   And it's been incredibly challenging, but we're making it work.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.680]   And I think overall, we're much happier.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.920]   Well, if you're much happier, that's a win to me.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:32.160]   I know from your, I think your TikTok videos or something that, so she got a pay increase,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.600]   but you did not, no?
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.000]   What are you doing in Memphis?
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.400]   Yeah, so her pay is equivalent, I would say.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:46.000]   That was one of the stipulations of her coming across and taking this larger role.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.280]   She wanted to at least make the same amount of money.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.960]   And so that was part of her contract.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:57.520]   But for me, I knew that I would be in the short term taking a huge loss because they
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.760]   wanted her to start right away.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:04.720]   And I published this post where I basically calculated that I lost about half a million
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:10.640]   dollars moving to Memphis because I wasn't working for about five months because I was
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.760]   working on my medical license.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.960]   I hadn't lined up a job, but they wanted her to start right away.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.480]   So a lot of people criticized this.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   They were like, "You idiot.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.160]   Why did you move without lining up a new job?"
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.240]   And I don't think they realized that my wife actually makes a very good living and that
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.720]   they wanted her to start immediately, right?
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:32.040]   So we, in the course of just four to eight weeks, moved across the country, you know,
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.800]   and we had to buy a new house.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.440]   We hadn't sold our LA house.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.760]   So we had to come up with the cash for that.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   And then in the five months that it took me to start practicing medicine again, I lost
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.680]   about 250K or 300K in opportunity costs of not working.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.320]   But for us, we knew that would happen.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.720]   And we were okay with that because we had savings, et cetera.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.680]   And again, we were taking a calculated risk.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.320]   Since then, I did talk to traditional practices out here, and they were not really cool with
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   the level of sort of autonomy and freedom that I wanted over my week.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:12.280]   So instead of joining a private practice, I'm doing what's called locum tendens medicine,
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:20.680]   where you sort of are a for-hire physician that you'll come in and say, you know, a hospital
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.120]   suddenly has someone quit or retire or get disabled.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   They need to cover and get help with those patients.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.480]   So you come in and you help them.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:33.800]   And it is very efficient in terms of time and income, and you have complete control
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   of your schedule.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.040]   So that's what I have been doing for the past few months.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:43.440]   And we're working on the finer details in terms of all of it, but it's working out pretty
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.120]   well so far.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.480]   Okay.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   Going to a new city, new state with family seems to be tough for me.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.280]   I don't think I can convince my wife to move at all.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:01.360]   I mean, it's hard enough to convince her to move houses in the same city, let alone a
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   new state and city.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:10.560]   I know Memphis is a booming city in terms of at least real estate, but the diversity
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.360]   in Memphis is different from the diversity in Southern California.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:21.200]   Can you talk about how adjusting to a different type of city culture has affected you guys
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.480]   as an Asian-American family?
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.640]   Sure.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:31.240]   And I think it's a very pertinent thing to talk about because diversity is important.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:38.440]   So Memphis is actually a majority black city, and it has about 2% or 3% Asians.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   Wow.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   Really low.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.120]   I mean, coming from San Francisco where, I don't know the Asian percentage, but it's
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.680]   got to be at least- It's like 50%.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.680]   It's huge, right?
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.600]   So when you look around and when you walk around, you see many fewer Asians.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:57.920]   And my kids, they're half-E's.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.040]   They're half Korean, half Caucasian.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.880]   But the Korean identity is important to us.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:10.920]   But even in a place where there's only 3% Asian community, there's still Asians.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.040]   And so my kids still go to Korean school.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.080]   My parents came with us to Memphis, and they go to a Korean church on the weekends.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.080]   Interesting.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.480]   So you can still find community.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:27.560]   But I'd be lying if I said that restarting in terms of your social life and forming friends
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.040]   and all that is not challenging.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.720]   That's one thing that we're working on.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.520]   But we're willing to put in the time and make it work.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.520]   Okay.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:40.120]   So it's hard, but it's maybe not as hard as you thought.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   It's like an adventure?
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.600]   I mean, I think that's what we're seeing it because we know that professionally, my wife
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.520]   and I are much, much happier.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.040]   The schooling options were actually much better here.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:57.040]   So in LA, we couldn't even get a call back from the admissions director at the top private
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.560]   schools in LA.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.240]   It's like-- You don't want to go to Harvard, Westlake, or
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.240]   whatever?
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   It's like Hunger Games.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   It's like Hunger Games out there.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:10.560]   It's like you're going to be fighting against the entertainment industry like Progeny, who
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.720]   are like billionaires.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:16.540]   So it's hard to get attention at the good private schools.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:20.120]   But they were incredibly welcoming here in Memphis.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.760]   So the nation is kind of sleeping on Memphis.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.600]   It gets a bad rap because of crime.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.920]   And those are the things that make the news.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:32.640]   But there is an incredibly passionate philanthropy sort of community here that is investing into
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   the city.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:39.200]   And they saw bringing in my wife and bringing my family to the city as like a big win.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.400]   So they were like, "Okay, so we're going to help you get into private school.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.520]   We're going to help you get set up here and there."
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.960]   And it has been an incredibly welcoming experience.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:54.840]   And in that regard, I think it's been a lot more seamless than we expected.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.120]   That's good to hear.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:01.520]   I think it actually sounds like it helps being a Korean American where the population is
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:05.240]   only 2% to 3% because you're more unique.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:10.720]   And so you bring different viewpoints, culture, profession, all that good stuff.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   So that's pretty good.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:17.840]   I know I talked to my wife about whether we should move to Virginia or Hawaii.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.920]   And the reason why I say Virginia or Hawaii is because I grew up in Virginia for high
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.520]   school and college.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.680]   And the Asian American community, there was something like 5% or 6%.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:32.460]   And I encountered some occasional racism, some fights, public schools.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:38.720]   But in retrospect, I think it really toughened me up and it has made me more resilient in
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:43.880]   terms of the ills of the world and combating and standing up for yourself.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.040]   And I was saying to myself, "Well, why don't we go back to Virginia and just kind of rough
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.160]   and tumble it a little bit more?"
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.280]   It's not like Virginia is that rough and tumble but like versus going to Hawaii where it's
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:58.720]   majority Asian, it's good lifestyle, peace, awesome love, great weather.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.320]   And she said, "Absolutely, we're not going to Virginia."
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.840]   So I'm trying to think about the parallel of you going to Memphis, Tennessee versus
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.000]   staying in Southern California and we go to Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.560]   Because I like the grit.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.960]   I like that.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.960]   It's just real.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.640]   It's the real world.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:23.200]   How much do you think we're sheltering our children in developing?
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.600]   Because if we send them to private schools and they grow up in a nice house and their
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:33.280]   parents earn money, are you afraid that you're going to make them soft?
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.840]   And how are they going to function in life?
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:42.760]   Yeah, I mean, I think it is no doubt that our success means that our children are going
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:48.240]   to have less challenges in terms of things in their childhood.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.240]   I think that's – it's funny.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.120]   It's almost like a double-edged sword, right?
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.760]   You want to do well so that you can provide for your kids.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   But a lot of the experiences that shaped me and made me who I am and make me sort of this
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.920]   like determined striver who always wants to improve myself, a lot of that came from the
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.600]   challenges that I saw when I was growing up.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.120]   We were poor for a certain part of my childhood.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:16.680]   And that made me want to achieve so that I can provide for my family in a very good way.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.720]   But we talked about this.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.360]   So in LA, it's like perfect weather, right?
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:28.040]   And I always joked that everyone I encountered from Southern California in life always went
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.360]   back to Southern California for their professional lives.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.960]   It's almost like they couldn't hack it with the weather that exists outside of Southern
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   California.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:42.200]   So my kids, when it's hot here because it's very hot in Memphis, they wilt.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   I wilt too.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.440]   We're not used to it.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:49.920]   But yeah, I think that there is a risk that if you provide too much, you can make your
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.280]   kids "soft" or whatever.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.560]   But I think that doesn't mean that you don't want to provide a good education.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.320]   That doesn't mean that you don't want to buy them clothes and things like that.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.360]   I think you have to provide them with challenges in other ways.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:09.680]   So challenging situations and challenging programs, there are other ways to do it.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.920]   And we haven't figured it out.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.960]   My kids are young still.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.080]   But we'll both have to do that, I guess.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.680]   So tell me about your net worth goals and your financial goals.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.880]   Because you left, I'm assuming, a $400,000 to $600,000 job as a urologist in Southern
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.880]   California.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.320]   I'm assuming you're making less than that band in Memphis, but the cost of living is
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.120]   much lower.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.760]   What is financial independence to you?
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.600]   And do you have specific net worth targets?
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.320]   And how do you come up with those targets?
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.920]   So I was very calculated about this.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   So two years into Tendinghood, when I was making a certain amount of money and it was
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:55.560]   a reliable paycheck and I knew what things were going to be like, I used that to project
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.580]   out a 15-year plan to financial independence.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.480]   And I knew exactly how much we were spending in Southern California and how much we're
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   likely to save and an 8% return in the stock market.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:12.400]   And I calculated that we would need about $6.5 to $7 million of investments.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:18.320]   And by the 4% rule, that would provide everything we needed, including inflation and all that,
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.400]   and we'd be good, right?
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.860]   Things are a little bit different now because after a while, I decided that actually the
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:31.040]   fastest way to financial independence is through residential real estate because so much of
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:36.320]   your return is in cash, in rent payments, and you could use that to just directly offset
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.320]   your living costs.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.400]   So you don't have to abide by the 4% rule anymore because you can just pay for things
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.680]   out of the income from the rental property.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:51.440]   So over the last four or five years, I've increasingly shifted our investments to real
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   estate.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:59.960]   So that has shifted my goal of a certain sort of investment number in the stock market to
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:07.480]   a cash flow number from real estate.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:12.760]   So about a year or so ago, I calculated that the cash flow that we've created already with
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:23.000]   our portfolio, which is 28 units currently and worth about $9 million of real estate,
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.640]   the cash flow we generate has cut off about five years from that financial independence
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   goal.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.440]   So we're probably going to get there, this was one or two years ago, I was like, "We're
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.200]   going to get there probably in about 10 years or less."
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:38.540]   And then I didn't publish it, but I secretly feel that we're going to be there in five
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.080]   years or less, right?
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:50.200]   So in terms of income, by the way, in terms of transparency, by working seven to 10 days
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:57.240]   a month in urology as a traveling urologist, I'll still be making 400K plus a year.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.560]   Seven to 10 days a month, that's it?
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.920]   Seven to 10 days a month.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.160]   And how many hours a day is that?
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.280]   About 10 hours a day.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:13.160]   So it's a long day and I'm covering call, I'm doing procedures, I'm doing surgery, it's
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.160]   busy.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:20.080]   But the rest of the time I'm home, I'm talking to you, I'm working on business and it's an
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.960]   incredible amount of freedom outside of that.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.240]   So for me, that's actually much more satisfying in terms of a balance.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.880]   And so my income has not, it's gone down because I was making, when I left Southern California,
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.000]   about 600K a year.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.780]   So it's gone down from there quite significantly, but it's allowing me freedom to grow areas
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:44.600]   of business that have much higher potential.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.920]   So I was never going to make more than 600K as a urologist in Southern California.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   I was very lucky to make that and I'm very grateful for that, but I knew that it's unlimited
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.000]   what you can make in business.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:02.280]   So for me, making 300 or 400K a year as a locum tendens urologist and having all that
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:09.080]   extra time to work on the blog, work on social media and real estate investing, it has, I
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.680]   have no doubt that it's going to be much more lucrative in the long term.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   Okay.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.280]   So that's interesting.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.960]   So six to seven million was the target, but it's, it sounds, so when you said 9 million
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.320]   in real estate, is that just total real estate exposure excluding the debt you have on the
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.440]   real estate?
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.440]   Excluding the debt, correct.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.600]   So if I were to sell it, that's how much you would get, but then I wouldn't end up with
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.800]   that because I have to pay back all the mortgages and stuff like that.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.800]   Right, right.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   Got it.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:41.920]   Well, it sounds like you have a lot on your plate, but then, you know, knowing that you
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:48.240]   only do seven to 10 days out of a 30 to 31 day month, that, that sounds pretty great.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.760]   It leaves you a lot of time.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.800]   I mean, how long do you think you can do?
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:56.840]   What's your ideal duration to do this kind of hybrid day job work and entrepreneurial
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.380]   work for?
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:04.120]   So I, I would love over the next year or so to get to a point where I am status quo, where
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.120]   I'm, I'm happy in all aspects, all, you know, I see it as the triad, right?
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.520]   So there's like traditional medicine, there's my family and there's business.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:19.600]   And over the next year I would like to get to a point where I can sustainably do that
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:24.120]   balance forever because I've sort of like find the balance that works for me.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.840]   And I think I'm pretty close actually.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.400]   So doing medicine seven to 10 days a month I think is satisfying that, that itch for
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.840]   medicine and I love practicing.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.920]   I love surgery still.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:44.240]   And if I can do that and just be gone one weekend, one week a month, including the weekend
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.080]   and having the rest of my time to just be present for my family, I think that's pretty
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   good.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:55.520]   And I am hoping to scale up pretty rapidly in multifamily real estate, which takes a
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.040]   lot of investment in terms of making contacts and like finding investors and things like
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.040]   that.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.840]   So I think I can do that with the time that I have outside of medicine very, very easily.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.280]   So I think I'm pretty close to sort of a permanent sustainable thing.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.320]   You know, ideally I wouldn't have to travel to do the medicine part, but if I do, I think
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.320]   I'm okay with that, at least for now.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   Got it.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   Got it.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:29.280]   So in conclusion, any departing advice for listeners in terms of medicine, entrepreneurship,
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:34.400]   going on the path, what would you say to them who are actively looking to achieve financial
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.400]   independence?
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.860]   Yeah, I would speak to it sort of more globally, like in terms of life trajectories, right?
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.600]   So I think everyone should be going towards financial independence.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   Absolutely.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.320]   But I think for a lot of people it is going to take a long time just depending on your
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.200]   circumstances of your income and things like that.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.720]   I think it's a worthy goal for everyone.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:59.080]   I would say more globally though, like what I say is that we have this one life, right?
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:03.640]   And before you know it, if you don't do anything active to move towards your goals, you'll
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:10.640]   look up and you'll be 65 and retired and just be kind of tired, right?
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.600]   Because you've spent your life doing something that maybe you're not satisfied with.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:21.280]   So I think you don't want to be that frog that is in the pot of boiling water that just
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   gets boiled, right?
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:26.400]   If you notice things in your life that are not to your liking, start thinking about them
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.780]   and being active in terms of changing your circumstances.
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.880]   So maybe it means a change in what you're doing in your spare time.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.080]   Maybe it means a change in your job and your employment.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:42.760]   But make those changes, start moving every single day slowly towards your goals and those
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.040]   changes and your effort will compound.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.280]   And five years from now, you could be living the life that you dream.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.280]   So that's what I would say.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.280]   Dr. Iyer Well, great.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   Thanks, Doc.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.800]   If listeners want to get in touch with you, learn more, where can they find you?
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.040]   Dr. Kahn I think the easiest is for most of us is going
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:04.680]   to be my blog, which is thedarwiniandoctor.com.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:11.600]   It's where I have sort of chronicled my journey so far and where a lot of the big events gets
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   chronicled.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:17.560]   I've actually surprisingly gotten kind of a following on TikTok.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:24.080]   So I have like 110,000 followers on TikTok at The Darwinian Doctor.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.040]   And it's the same thing for YouTube.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:31.400]   And I think I could get into a little bit more detail in sort of like video format because
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.800]   you can just communicate a lot more rapidly.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:37.200]   So it's sort of a very good corollary to the blog.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   But those are the two places where people can easily find me.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.480]   Dr. Iyer All right.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.480]   Well, thanks so much.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:47.520]   And listeners, if you enjoyed this episode, please rate, review and share.
