[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   In the life and ministry of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   the account of which we read together in the reading at the beginning,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   as it is to be found recorded in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And in particular this evening, I should like to direct attention to the tenth verse.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   The tenth verse in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   "The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   'It is the Sabbath day; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.'"
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Now I want to call attention not merely to the contents of that particular verse,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   but rather to that which is suggested by the verse.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Namely the whole attitude of these Jews,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   which really means here primarily the Pharisees, to our Lord and Saviour.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Now last Sunday evening we were considering this incident
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   as it is a portrayal of the great Gospel of salvation which we meet together to consider.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   It is an actual historical fact and event.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   What we read here literally and actually happened.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I don't understand the man who is in difficulties about miracles.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   If you believe that the Son of God rarely came down into this world,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   you shouldn't be surprised if you read that he worked miracles, and he did.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And this miracle actually took place.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   But we were concerned about it not only in and of itself,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   but as it is a portrayal and representation of this wondrous and glorious Gospel of salvation.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But now tonight I want to direct attention to the response to that.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Here it is, it took place.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And any event such as this of necessity produces some kind of a response.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And this incident produced a response.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And what we are told here is of the two responses to the one and same incident.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We have on the one hand the response of these Jews,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and on the other hand we have the response of the man who was healed.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And you notice that they are diametrically different and opposed.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Surely we all must feel as we read this story, this incident, this account,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   a sense of surprise and of amazement.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   As we read of the response of these Jews,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   never perhaps has the word "therefore" had such a strange significance
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   as it has in this particular tenth verse.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And that is why I am taking it as my text,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   especially taking it in connection with verse 9.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Listen.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   "And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And on the same day was the Sabbath.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The Jews therefore, therefore, because of what had just happened,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   said unto him, That was cured, it is the Sabbath day.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Notice the "therefore".
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Because of the miracle, because of the healing, because of the curing,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   because of this miraculous and supernatural thing which had just taken place.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   What a reaction!
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   What a response!
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   How different, I say, from the response of the man who was healed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Now my point is that surely all this must come to us as something amazing
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and astounding and almost incredible.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Isn't it almost beyond comprehension and beyond credibility
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   that any man or any group of men could possibly react in this extraordinary manner
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   to this momentous thing that had just taken place?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And yet all of us who are familiar with the Gospels are not surprised.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Because as you read through these Gospels, that's what you find, isn't it?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Our Lord performed miracle after miracle.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   He worked these deeds of kindness and of compassion.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   He relieved suffering.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And yet what did he meet?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Opposition, scowling, questions, attempts to trap him and to ensnare him,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   malignity on the part of these Pharisees and scribes and doctors of the law.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   On he goes working his miracles and they take up stones and throw them at him.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   He spoke as never men speak.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Gracious words came over his lips and yet they bared their teeth at him and snarled at him.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And eventually they all joined together.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   People who formerly had been at enmity, like Pilate and King Herod,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   people who hadn't spoken for years, they came together and plotted together against him.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees who were bitterly opposed all became one.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And they all of them joined together to cry away with him, crucify him and incited the people.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And as we know, he ended his life upon a cross between two thieves.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   They hurled shame and scorn and derision upon him.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   That was his fate.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   That was the end of his life.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Now, I'm just asking a question.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Why was that?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   What explains that?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   What can account for such a response, such a reaction,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   to these mighty things that were here done on the face of this earth by the Son of God?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   That's the question.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And there is no more important question confronting the human race this evening than just this question.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But let me make it perfectly plain and clear
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   that I'm not putting this question to you this evening theoretically or in an academic manner.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I'm not just standing here and saying,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   "Oh, this is an extraordinary phenomenon that we've got here in the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Let's turn aside and look at it tonight and dissect it and analyze it."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   No, no, I'm not doing that.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm doing that, but I'm not simply doing that.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Our attitude must not be theoretical. Why?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Well, because you and I this evening, every one of us,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   is in precisely the same position as these Jews of which we're reading.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Because the whole case of this Gospel is to say this,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   that as He confronted these people there in the days of His flesh,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He's confronting the whole world this evening.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   That's the meaning of a preaching service such as this.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It is that Christ is presented, that He confronts men and women who come and listen.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So we're in the identical position of these very Jews of whom we read in this tenth verse.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I say it's not a theoretical question.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   We all of us come face to face with this Christ, with this Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And you know, it's as true to say tonight as it was in the days of His flesh,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   that there are only two final responses to Him.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And every one of us in this congregation at this minute has made the one response or else the other.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   We are either like these Jews or else we're like the men who was healed.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It's one or the other.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And there is no evading these two possibilities.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And there is no middle position between the two.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Christ divides us. We're either for or else against.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   You can't be neutral. You can't be passive.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   If we're not for Him, we're against Him.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Now I'm not saying that. He said that Himself.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   He that is not for me, He said is against me.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He said that His coming was like a sword that divides even mother and daughter,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   father and son, husband and wife.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   At once as we confront Him we are placed in a position where we've got to decide.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And we do. If we do nothing, we're against.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   We're all of us either for Him or against Him.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   We're either, I say, in the position of the men healed or else we are in the position of these Jews
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   who therefore made this statement to the men whom our Lord had healed.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And I would again remind you that there is no more important question that can ever come to any one of us
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   than just this question, which of these responses is ours?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I don't apologize for being blunt and plain. I needn't, need I?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   What I'm really asking is this.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   When you sang that last hymn, were you singing the words or only the tune?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Were you singing your experience? Were you singing that which is true of you?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Did you really mean it? How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believer's ear.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   It heals his sorrows, heals his wounds, soothes his sorrows, heals his wound, and drives away his tears.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Is that your experience? Is that your additive to Him?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Can you say quite honestly that His name is sweet to you?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That His name is above every other name to you?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That He is the incomparable One, the One who stands alone?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That's to be Christian. And that is the essence of Christianity.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Either we can say honestly how sweet the name of Jesus sounds,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   or else we are in the position of these Jews.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Now it's neither you saying, "Ah, I'm neither one nor the other."
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You must be one or the other.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   If you really believe in Him, you must say that His name is sweet to you.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   If you don't, well, you can't say it.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And if you don't say it, it means that you don't believe in Him.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   You've never really faced Him. You don't know Him.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   No one can be apathetic in His presence.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   No one ever was in the days of His flesh.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   No one has ever been ever since, or has ever heard of Him.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And therefore I say that this evening we are all of us in one of these two positions.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And what makes it all so urgent is this.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That according to what He goes on Himself to say to these people,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   did you notice it in verse 23?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   That our eternal destiny depends upon this thing.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   What will decide how every one of us is going to spend eternity
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   is our attitude to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   To those who can say that His name is sweet,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   we know that their eternity is to be one of bliss and of joy.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And alas, it's got to be said,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   to those to whom the name of Jesus is not sweet,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   they have nothing to look forward to but misery and wretchedness and useless remorse.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   My dear friend, let me put my question again.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   What is your reaction to Him?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Well, in order to help in this self-examination tonight,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   let me put before you this case that is outlined here.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Because here we see the whole thing placed before us in a very clear and in a very dramatic manner.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And therefore having looked at this, we'll be enabled to examine ourselves.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   That's the value of the Scripture.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   That's the purpose of the record.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   That's the whole business of preaching.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   It's to bring all this to us, and we have it here in illustration.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So I divide my matter up like this.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   First of all, let us again be quite clear in our minds as to what confronts the two groups.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   What was it that was confronting the Jews and the men?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   What is it that confronts everybody in the world tonight?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Well, here it is quite simply.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   In the case of these people in the incident there, they were confronted by two things.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   The first, of course, was the miracle.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And the second was the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and the claims that he made for himself.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Now those are the two big things I think you'll all agree.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Here is a person called Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   he suddenly comes to this place, the pool of Bethesda.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And there are all these people, these men in particular have been going there,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   carried there thirty-eight years, impotent, unable to do anything for himself.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And all the others, you remember, the blind, the lame, the impotent, the withered, and so on,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   all desperate and hopeless, waiting for the stirring of the waters that they might get in first and be healed.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And suddenly there walks into this hopeless, helpless crowd, this person, this extraordinary person,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And he approaches this man and says, "Wilt thou be made whole?"
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And the man, you remember, makes his speech and says, "What's the use of asking?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   I've been here so long and I've got nobody. I'm a poor man.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I haven't got a servant to put me in. Everybody else is rushing in before me.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I've nobody to put me in. It's always somebody else."
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And suddenly our Lord looked at the man and said, "Wilt thou be made whole?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Very well then, rise, take up thy bed and walk."
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And the man immediately was made whole and took up his bed and walked.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   The miracle, the astounding miracle, it's confronting him, it's confronting the Jew.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And then with it, I say, is the person.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And the claims he makes for himself, they understood the claims all right.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   He looked at them, you remember, and said, "My father worketh hitherto and I work."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   The Jews sought the more to kill him because he had not only broken the Sabbath,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   but had also said that God was his father, making himself equal with God.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And they're quite right, that's exactly what he does, I mean.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   But there he is standing before them, he not only works the miracle, he speaks and he makes claims.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And there they are, they're confronted by the two tremendous things.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Now I'm saying that both parties were confronted by the same facts exactly.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   The same miracle, the same person, the same words, the same claim.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Now all that is equally true of everybody who's in the world this evening.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   It's true of Christians, it's true of those who are not Christians.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Shall we therefore remind ourselves very hurriedly of the facts by which we are confronted.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   What is it that Christianity holds before men and women tonight?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   What are these things which I claim are facts confronting us?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Well, I divide them up like this.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   First of all, take the Bible itself.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Take this book.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Here is a book that is confronting the human race tonight.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   What does it confront them with?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   What are the facts which it holds before them?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Well, take your Old Testament.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   What do you find there?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Well, you find that standing out prominently above everything else
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   is the history and the story of that people called the Jews.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And what a story it is, what a remarkable story.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   How did they ever come into being?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   How do you account for the Jews?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   How do you account for the strange vicissitudes through which they passed?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   How do you account for the fact that this little race and this little country
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   became so mighty at times?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   How do you explain it?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   How do you explain their persistence in spite of all that is so true of them
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and in spite of these mighty dynasties by which they were surrounded?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   How do you explain the phenomenon, the fact of the Jew in history
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   running right through the Old Testament,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   and you can trace it likewise in secular history?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   There it is.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   But take another fact that stands out prominently in the Old Testament,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   the fact of prophecy.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   There's a great deal of prophecy in the Old Testament.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   A number of things are foretold there.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   It's said quite categorically that certain things are going to happen.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And in the Old Testament itself you can see some of them happening.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Certain warnings that God gave to these people and they came to pass.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Certain predictions that were made about some of them,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   about a man like Abram at the age of 99 and his wife over 90,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   that they're going to have a son, and the son came.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   These are the kind of things that confront you here.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Not only that, there are still more specific things than that.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   There are prophecies and predictions as to someone who's going to come into this world,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   that a virgin is going to give birth to a child,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   he's going to be born in a place called Bethlehem.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   All that's in the Old Testament.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And many other details in a most amazing manner,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   that he'll be of the tribe of David and all these other things.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   What's going to happen to him, the opposition he'll meet,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   the scorn and the persecution,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   how he's going to ride into Jerusalem on the back of a, the foal of an ass.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   All these things in the Old Testament.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Prophecy.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Now there I say are some of the great facts in connection with the Bible,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   that stand before us and insist upon some kind of a verdict with respect to themselves.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Then in addition to that we turn over into the New Testament and what do we find?
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Well, here, standing out above everything and everybody,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   is this blessed person, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And what do we find here?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   We find a person, we find a life lived.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   We find someone who, though born in poverty and never had any training at all,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   understands more about the law than the greatest experts and all the Pharisees.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   It's here, it's confronting us, this phenomenon that's been thrown up.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Jesus, a carpenter, who can defy the doctors of the law at the age of twelve,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and when he goes out in his public ministry is unanswerable and cannot be refuted.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   A phenomenon works these miracles.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   All this is standing before us, his words, his teaching.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And then the most amazing thing of all is death.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   This man who could quell the raging of the storm at sea,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   who could heal the leper, give hearing to the deaf, make the blind see,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   raise an impotent man up like this by just a word,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   who could raise the very dead out of the grave,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   is arrested and in apparent weakness, is crucified and dies,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and is buried in a grave, and the stone is rolled over on the face of the grave.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   But, and here it is, the most momentous fact of all, he rose again, the resurrection,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and revealed himself to chosen witnesses, five hundred people together on one occasion.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   The resurrection. Here it is facing us.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   These are the claims, these are the statements about this person.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And then add to this the story of the church.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You remember the twelve crestfallen apostles, disciples, don't you,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   who in spite of his teaching were completely shattered when he was crucified on the tree,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   didn't understand, and felt utterly hopeless and utterly disconsolate.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Wait a minute, I notice in a few months these men are preaching about the place.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   One of them, the apostle Peter, stands up in Jerusalem,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   in the very center of the opposition, preaches one sermon,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   three thousand people are converted.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   What's happened to him? What is this?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Ah, this is the result of the resurrection,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and the result of the sending of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Now the fact of the change in the apostles is a fact of history.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Christianity belongs to history.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   You'll find it in the secular records, even of the Roman Empire.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   It became a problem, it became a phenomenon.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   These Christians were charged with causing political uprisings.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   There it is in the secular history. The church, where she come from,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   how do you explain her momentous, mighty fact? The Christian church.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Trace her history and her story down the running centuries.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   See the attempt of the Jews at the very beginning to destroy her.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   See the attempt of the great and mighty Roman Empire to exterminate her.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   See the attempt of Greek philosophy to throttle her and her teaching
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   by ridicule and by cleverness and worldly wisdom.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   See these arise one after another against her, and yet on she goes.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   This is a phenomenon.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And then, if you like, take up your biographies,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   begin to read about the men like Saul of Tarsus, later the apostle Paul.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Read of Augustine. Oh, read of all these mighty men
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   coming down through the centuries. Go and talk to them, listen to them,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   see what happened to them, the change in their lives, the men they became,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   what they did, the greatest benefactors the world has ever known.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Look at them. There they are standing before you.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   They are confronting you tonight, the facts.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Now then, there is our position, isn't it?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Before the Jews and these men were the miracle and the Christ incarnate and his claims.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And there I put very hurriedly and inadequately before you the phenomena,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   the facts, facing and confronting the human race at this very moment.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Now then, let's look at the attitudes.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   First of all, let us look at the attitude of these Pharisees.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   "The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   'It is the Sabbath day; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.'"
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   You see their reaction, don't you? Annoyance, irritation, unbelief, rejection.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   What's the cause of this? That's the question.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And my dear friend, let me remind you again that I'm doing all this
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   in order that if you who are listening to me at this moment are not a Christian
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   and you cannot say honestly how sweet the name of Jesus sounds,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I'm trying to show you why you are in that condition.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   You are like these Jews. What accounts for their reaction?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   There's one word that puts it all, and it is the word "prejudice."
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Nothing but prejudice, nothing whatsoever, but sheer prejudice,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   which is always the result of sin.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Sin prejudices us against the truth of God.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   That's what it did away back at the beginning,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and the devil knew how to use it so perfectly.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   He came to Adam and Eve and he said, "Hath God said?"
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   God's against you. Ah, at once the prejudice has been put in.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   God's against you.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And the moment you get that prejudice,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   well, it's going to color everything you do and everything you say.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It'll control all your thinking, and it'll all be blind.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   As Paul says in writing to the Corinthians,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   second chapter, fourth chapter, and about fourth verse,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   of them that believe, not lest they believe the glorious gospel of Christ."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   The trouble with every unbeliever, I say, is nothing but sheer prejudice,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   because he doesn't believe that, he doesn't say that, he doesn't like that.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   He talks about knowledge, doesn't he? He talks about cleverness,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   talks about his brain, talks about science, Zeta, and so on.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Wonderful advances, 20th century.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Know so much, can't possibly believe it.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   But my dear friend, knowledge has got nothing whatsoever to do with it.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I can prove that quite easily.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   It's purely a matter of prejudice, and I prove that, you see, like this.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I can take the same men, the same men with the same brain,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   the same knowledge, the same everything.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   At one stage in his life he's against, then in the second stage he's for.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   With the same gigantic brain, with the same immense knowledge,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   with that vast erudition, with this command of science,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   whereas he formerly rejected, he now believes.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   But of course there is a case in the Bible itself that settles that point once and forever,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and it is the case of the men whom we know as the Apostle Paul.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Saul of Tarsus, the Pharisee, hated Christ and would have exterminated his cause.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And then the same man was converted and became a Christian,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   and he begins to sing how sweet the name of Jesus sounds, the same man.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And he looks back and he says, "Why did I reject? Why was I against?"
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And he says, "I did it ignorantly in unbelief, prejudiced by sin and by Satan."
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And what a devastating thing prejudice is.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Had you realized, my friend, that if you're not a Christian, you're just governed by prejudice,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   you're blinded by prejudice, and this is how it works.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   It's shown here very perfectly in this illustration.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   What did prejudice do to these men?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Well, here's one thing it did.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   It meant that they were utterly preoccupied with their own difficulties and their own problems.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And they were so much preoccupied with their own difficulties and their own problems
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   that they couldn't see the big facts that were staring them in the face.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Did you see that?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   "It is the Sabbath day, it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   See, they don't see the cure.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   They see this man breaking the laws, they think.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   They see some detail in their elaboration, false elaboration of the law, transgressed.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   They're preoccupied with their own ideas and their own thoughts and absolutely controlled by them.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   That's, you see, how prejudice does blind us.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And isn't that the simple truth about all who are not Christians this evening?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   They're so preoccupied with their own problems and own difficulties,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   with regard to the Scriptures and all these things, that they see nothing but that.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   You know them, don't you?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   A man says, "I'm not a Christian."
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   And you say, "Well, why are you not a Christian?"
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   He says, "You know, this Bible, it troubles me. Who was Cain's wife?"
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And he can't believe it.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   He doesn't say a word about Jesus Christ, Cain's wife, there it is,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   and that fish, whatever it was that swallowed Jonah, and these miracles.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "Oh, I just can't," says the man.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "You know, I'm a scientist, I'm scientifically trained."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Miracles, they're impossible.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And there he is, oh, every time you meet him, up it comes, miracles.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   "I don't want to ridicule, but I am trying to present a true and a fair picture."
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And I think you'll have to admit it's true.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   People come to me and say, "You know, I don't understand this.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   If you say there is a God, why does he allow war, or this or that or the other?"
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   That's it, always the same question.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   People come filled with their difficulties, their problems, the things they can't understand,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   and Christ is there the whole time, and they say nothing about him as if they'd never seen him.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   They're immersed in their own problems.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   These people, here they are, "It is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed,"
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   they say to a poor man who hasn't been able to move for 38 years.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I agree with you, it is a matter for laughter, and yet I'm not sure whether it's laughter or tears,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   that men can be so blinded and prejudiced, and so kept from the big things
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   by these little things in which they're immersed and by which they're preoccupied.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Their difficulties, their problems, this, that, and the other.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Here they are. Let me hurry to the second, I've already mentioned it.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Because of that, you see, you get their consequent failure to face the big facts.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   They can't see the wood because of the trees.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Did you notice how it comes out in their very language?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Notice the difference of the speech of the Jews and the men.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   "The Jews therefore said unto him that was healed,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   'It is the Sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.'"
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Listen to the men answering.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   "He answered them, 'He that made me whole, he brings Christ in, he brings the miracle in.'
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   The same said unto me, 'Take up thy bed and walk.'"
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Then asked they him, and now you'd expect to find here,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   "Who is this extraordinary man that has healed you?"
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Not a bit of it. "What man is that which said unto thee, 'Take up thy bed and walk?'"
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And the men couldn't answer them.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And then the story goes on the whole time, you see.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   They miss the miracle, they don't say a word about it,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   they don't say a word about the healing of the men.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   It's just this question of the mat that he's carrying, and the law, and the Sabbath.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   And they don't see the miracle, and they don't see the cure,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and they don't rarely see this Christ.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   They miss the big things because they're immersed in the little ones.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Isn't that still the trouble?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Have you considered him, my friend?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Have you looked at Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Forget all about miracles for a moment.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Forget about all these particular difficulties of yours.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   There are certain big things, I've already enumerated them,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   that are standing before you, confronting you,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   belonging to the warp and woof of history.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Not ideas, not theories, but facts,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   literal historical facts and events.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   There they are. Have you seen them?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   "In the name of God," I say, "and as you value your immortal soul."
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Look at these for a moment.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And forget your own pet questions and your own particular difficulties.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Because, you see, in the third place, this prejudice leads to this.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   That they are totally incapable of explaining the facts.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   These Jews couldn't explain the miracle.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   They probably knew this man.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Everybody knew him. Poor fellow.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   He'd been carried there for 38 years.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   He was a well-known case.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Perhaps the most hopeless case at the Pool of Bethesda.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And everybody knew about him.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Here is that very man.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   They meet him in the street, walking along and carrying the mat on which he's been lying.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And on their hypothesis and on their view,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   there is no explanation whatsoever of the miracle.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Isn't it amazing that they didn't address themselves to that?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Isn't it surprising that they didn't stop and say, "Men, what's happened to you?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   How's this taken place? Who's done this?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Surely this is no man could do this. You haven't done it yourself.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Well, who's done it? What is this? How have you been healed?"
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   They never asked that question. Never.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Interested in the mat.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Oh, that they'd asked, "How did he do it? Who is this who can do such things?"
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   But now they've got no explanation of the big thing that's confronting them.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And you know mankind is still in that position if it doesn't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Take the men, for instance, who says that Jesus Christ was only a man and no more,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   and just a teacher and he didn't work miracles.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Well, very well. If they say that, you see, what they're really confronted by is this.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   If he was only a man, well, then I say he was a blasphemer
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   because he claimed to be the Son of God and claimed to be equal with God.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   You can't have it both ways.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   If Jesus is only a man, well, then I say he was either a blasphemer or else a lunatic.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   There's no choice between those two positions.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   And they're left in this position of utter contradiction,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   utterly inconsistent with themselves.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   He and all that has been done through him is left without any explanation at all.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   This vital bit of history is meaningless, it's useless.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Ah, yes, but the tragic thing about them, I always think, was just this.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   That they were so blinded and governed by this prejudice
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   that not only did they fail in the respects which I've been outlining,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   but they failed supremely, I think, at just this point.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Why didn't they go to him and ask him to explain why he had done this thing on the Sabbath?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   They never asked him.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Now, you see, if they'd been thinking clearly, they would have done so of necessity.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Now, this is their problem. Here is a man who has healed another on the Sabbath,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   and he has caused him to carry his mat on the Sabbath, which to them was a breaking of the law.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Now, if they'd only been able to think clearly and without prejudice,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   they, I think, would have worked it out like this.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   They'd have said, "This man has been healed. This is undoubtedly a miracle.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   This must be the action of God.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   This man who has worked this miracle must have some divine power that we don't understand and we don't possess.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And yet he's done this on a Sunday. Very well. Let's go to him and let's ask him to explain himself.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Let us go and say quite openly, "We don't understand it. To us it seems very wrong.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And yet we see that you've got a power that we haven't got. Can you give us an explanation?
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   If there is one, in the name of God, let's have it. Do tell us. Explain to us."
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   They'd have gone to him in humility, even as Nicodemus went.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And they would have asked, "Well, now tell us. Give us an explanation."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   They never did it.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   They were so blinded by prejudice. They were so sure of their own case.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Ah, these clever trick questions. They never take them to Christ and all these problems.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   They denounce him instead of taking them to him and asking him to give his explanation.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   That's the real trouble with the unbeliever.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   My dear friend, if you only took your problems to Christ,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   if you only brought them to the church through whom Christ speaks,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   so many of your problems can be answered so easily.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   But men won't do that. They stand on their prejudices and they finally go to this last point,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   which is one of hatred and of rejection. Do you notice how it gets worse and worse?
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   "The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, persecute the man who has healed this other,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And then when he says, 'My Father worketh hitherto and I work,'
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   therefore the Jews sought them all to kill him because he had not only broken the Sabbath,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   That is the sorry story of unbelief.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   That's the analysis of men and women to whom the name of Jesus isn't sweet.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   He's someone to be argued against and to be dismissed and to be rejected.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Is there anyone in this congregation who's in that position?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Do you have to admit that the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   is not to you everything and you're all in all tonight?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   I say if that is the case with you, it is for these reasons.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   You've never really faced him.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   You've never gone to him.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   You've never realized who he is and what he's done.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   You've never even taken your problems to him.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   You've stood in your conceit and prejudice,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and you've simply been concerned to get rid of him and to denounce him and to reject him.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   That's sheer prejudice.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   But oh, let us turn away from such a tragic and a miserable attitude.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   What miserable men these are, that in the face of a miracle,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   a glorious miracle of healing, a man set on his feet
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   who'd been there impotent for 38 years.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Isn't it incredible that they can persist in this attitude?
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Let's leave them, I say, and let's turn and look at these other men.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   What a different attitude.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   What accounts for it?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Oh, I'm not going to keep you.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   It's all here, and it's all so simple.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Why is this man's attitude so different?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Well, the first thing, I think, is this.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Unlike those Jews,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   when this man looked into the face of Jesus Christ,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   he saw something that he'd never seen before.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Ah, that's the trouble, isn't it?
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   The Jews came to him, they came to Jesus,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and they looked at him, looked into the face of the Son of God,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   looked into this incarnation of everlasting love,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   looked into those eyes with their divine depths,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   and simply put their questions in order to down him.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   But this man, when Jesus came and addressed him and said,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   "Wilt thou be made whole?"
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   he looked into the eyes,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   and he saw something that he'd never seen before.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   He saw hope, he saw an authority,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   he saw power, he saw divinity.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   He saw something in the face.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   He saw something, he heard something in the voice.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Many people had gone to him at that pool and had offered their sympathy,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   and perhaps had, in a very vague and general way, had offered their help.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   But he'd never heard a voice like this.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   I believe he said to himself what the soldier said later on,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   "Never men speak like this man."
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   An authority, a power, something in the question.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   "Wilt thou be made whole?"
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   He asked it in such a way as to say this,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   "If you want it, you can have it."
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And he'd never felt that before.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Everything was impotent, everything was but general.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   But here comes someone and says, "Wilt thou be made whole?"
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   And as he hears that "wilt," he says, "I see a possibility."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   He looked into the face of God, he saw something, he heard something,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   and he submitted, he obeyed.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   So when Christ said, "Stand upon thy feet, take up thy bed,"
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   without thinking what he was doing,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   the men who hadn't been able to move for 38 years,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   he simply did it.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   He did it automatically, submitting to the authority of the Son of God.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   That is what happens to every man who becomes a Christian.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Suddenly or gradually it comes to him that here is someone who stands alone.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Not a man amongst men, but God come in the flesh.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   He hears his words, he feels the power of his voice,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   and at once he's disturbed.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   He's condemned perhaps at first, and then he feels the hope,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and he responds, he believes, he trusts, and he obeys,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and he rises out of his sin.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   That's the secret of the man, isn't it?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   And you see what it leads to is this,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   that he the whole time goes on talking about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   He's aware of what Christ has done for him.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Look at these men, their legalistic minds.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   "Is it not lawful for thee to carry thy bed?"
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   He answered, "He that made me whole."
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   "Stop talking about Matt," he says, "talk about him."
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   "Stop talking about your law, and look at me.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   There I've been for 38 years, look at me now."
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   "He did it, he that made me whole."
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   He talks about Christ,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and about Christ alone has been able to do for him.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   "He that made me whole."
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   This is the language of the Christian,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   not your little arguments about miracles and providence,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   and "I don't understand this, and I can't follow that,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   and it says this here, but that seems to contradict."
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   "Oh, all's gone, he."
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   "He that has made me whole."
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   "He that has given me a new nature and a new life."
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   "He that has put me on my feet and made a new man of me."
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   "He that has given me strength to conquer where I formerly went down."
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   "Talk about him, listen to him."
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   This man gives Christ all the glory.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   You remember how Paul puts this?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   "By the grace of God I am what I am."
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   "I was a persecutor and a blasphemer," he says,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   "and an injurious person, but I obtained mercy."
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   "And by the grace of God I am what I am."
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   "Don't look at me, don't speak to me, it's he."
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Do you remember Peter and John healing the men at the beautiful gate of the temple?
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And this man again who had been impotent went bouncing, leaping,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   praising God into the temple, and the people gathered and looked at Peter and John.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And Peter said unto them, "Don't look at us."
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   As if by our own power or words we had made this impotent man to walk.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   His name, his name, by faith in his name,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   hath given these men this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   They talk about Christ, why?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Well, because of what he has done for them.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   They gave him all the glory.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   And the next thing I notice is this.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Did you notice it?
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   "Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple."
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Yes, in the temple, worshipping and praising God.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Not spending his Sunday reading the clever men in the clever Sunday newspapers
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   with their difficulties and their problems and all their wealthiness.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   No, no, in the temple of God.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   What for? Worshipping God, praising God,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   singing the anthems, singing the hymns,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   thanking him, a man on his feet who had never been able to go there,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   walking through the vestibule, entering the house of God,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   becoming a member of the church,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   joining the ranks of the redeemed in the temple.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   And the last thing, telling others about him,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   "The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole."
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   He felt to himself, when I tell them,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   they'll all go rushing after him.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   They'll say to him, "Do it to me."
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   That's what the poor men expected, they didn't do that.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   But you see what he felt, he wanted to tell everybody about him.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   He wanted the whole world to go after him.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   He knew the need in the human heart and in the human breast.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   He wanted to say to them, he said to me,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   "Go, sin no more, lest a worse thing happen to you."
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   "And you, my friends," he would have said to them,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   "unless you repent and go to him and be healed by him,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   a worse thing will happen to you."
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   You are hell bound.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   But this Jesus has come into this world to save you and to redeem you,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   to rescue you and to set you free,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   to give you pardon and forgiveness,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   to reconcile you unto God and to make you children of God.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   He went and told the Jews.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And you know, he does come back to this.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   If I am a Christian, well, then I say that the supreme thing in life for me
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   is to know Christ, because through him alone I know God.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And there my eternal future is safe.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   And I am able to live even in this life and in this world.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believer's ear.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, and drives away his fear.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Jesus is his prophet, his priest, his king, his Lord.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   He is his all and in all.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He is the Son of God, who so loved him that he came from heaven to earth
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   and even went to the cruel, shameful death on the cross,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   that he might be forgiven and renewed and restored.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   O beloved friend, I ask you, what is your reaction to him?
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Forget everything but just this one thing.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Look at him.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Look at Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Look at him as he is depicted in the pages of this gospel.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Look at him as he verifies all the prophecies of the Old Testament.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Look at him as he continues his work in the church.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Look at him as you see him transforming the lives of men,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   not only then but subsequently throughout the long history of the Christian church.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Look at him in revivals.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   Look at these big things.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Look at the facts, the momentous facts.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   I cannot believe that you can go out of this service
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   still just harboring your little arguments and difficulties.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Forget the mat, they say, and see the man who is carrying it
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   and see that there is only one who can do such things.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   And that is Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, the Savior of your soul.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Look at him.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Look into his face.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Look into his eyes.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Listen to his word.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Hear the authority.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Feel the power.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Go to him and submit.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Take your problems to him.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Take your questions.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   He will never refuse you.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   He will never reject you.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   You will find him patient and compassionate.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   He will listen to you.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   He will allow you to speak your nonsense as he has listened to my nonsense.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   He will listen and he will answer.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Go to him just as you are with all your problems and failings and difficulties.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Go to him honestly and fall before him and listen to him.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   And he will make you whole.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Amen.
