[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   I think there's like a remote possibility that he actually has a bunch of specific concrete
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.320]   ideas for how to increase Twitter's free cash flow and how to pay down the debt and make it
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   a more profitable company. Maybe he just had that sense that it was overstaffed and that it should
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.000]   survive with a smaller headcount. And if you cut headcount enough, then you end up with a
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.760]   profitable business. It could also just have been fun and seems fun so far. The pursuit of fun is
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.560]   not to be discounted. The nature of Twitter's legitimacy has changed and that now it is under
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.080]   the rule of a single monarch instead of ruled by these sort of faceless bureaucracies. So now,
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.040]   if Twitter does something you don't like, there's actually a specific person you can blame. Because
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.920]   you have Twitter, you can actually yell at that person and potentially get an answer. And there's
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.120]   nothing lower status than arguing with someone in authority about how serious they should take
