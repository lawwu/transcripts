[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   The way I would do it, 75% headcount reduction across the board in the federal bureaucracy.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.440]   Send them home packing, shut down agencies that shouldn't exist, rescind every unconstitutional
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.180]   regulation that Congress never passed.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.560]   In a true self-governing democracy, it should be our elected representatives that make the
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.040]   laws and the rules, not an unelected bureaucrats.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.580]   Merit and equity are actually incompatible.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.480]   Merit and group quotas are incompatible.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.080]   You can have one or the other, you can't have both.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.460]   It's an assault and a crusade on the nanny state itself.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.220]   And that nanny state presents itself in several forms.
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.880]   There's the entitlement state, that's the welfare state, presents itself in the form
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.340]   of the regulatory state, that's what we're talking about.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.340]   And then there's the foreign nanny state, where effectively we are subsidizing other
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.660]   countries that aren't paying their fair share of protection or other resources we provide
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.660]   them.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.100]   If I was to summarize my ideology in a nutshell, it is to terminate the nanny state in the
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.120]   United States of America in all of its forms.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.640]   The entitlement state, the regulatory state, and the foreign policy nanny state.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.260]   Once we've done that, we've revived the republic that I think would make George Washington
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.260]   proud.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.860]   The following is a conversation with Vivek Ramaswamy about the future of conservatism
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.220]   in America.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.260]   He has written many books on this topic, including his latest called Truths, the Future of America
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.460]   First.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.100]   He ran for president this year in the Republican primary and is considered by many to represent
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.160]   the future of the Republican party.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.380]   Before all that, he was a successful biotech entrepreneur and investor with a degree in
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.380]   biology from Harvard and a law degree from Yale.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.980]   As always, when the topic is politics, I will continue talking to people on both the left
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.460]   and the right with empathy, curiosity, and backbone.
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.020]   This is the Left Streaming Podcast.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.340]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.280]   And now, dear friends, here's Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.040]   You are one of the great elucidators of conservative ideas, so you're the perfect person to ask,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.540]   what is conservatism?
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.020]   What's your, let's say, conservative vision for America?
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.780]   Well, actually, this is one of my criticisms of the modern Republican party and direction
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.500]   of the conservative movement, is that we've gotten so good at describing what we're against.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.620]   There's a list of things that we could rail against, wokeism, transgender ideology, climate
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.820]   ideology, COVIDism, COVID policies, the radical Biden agenda, the radical Harris agenda, the
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.420]   list goes on.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.620]   But actually, what's missing in the conservative movement right now is what we actually stand
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.100]   for.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.180]   What is our vision for the future of the country?
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.260]   And I saw that as a deficit at the time I started my presidential campaign.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.780]   It was in many ways the purpose of my campaign, because I do feel that that's why we didn't
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.600]   have the red wave in 2022.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.860]   So they tried to blame Donald Trump, they tried to blame abortion, they blamed a bunch
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.380]   of individual specific issues or factors.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.340]   I think the real reason we didn't have that red wave was that we got so practiced at criticizing
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.140]   Joe Biden that we forgot to articulate who we are and what we stand for.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.620]   So what do we stand for as conservatives?
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.700]   I think we stand for the ideals that we fought the American Revolution for in 1776.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.780]   Ideals like merit, right, that the best person gets the job without regard to their genetics,
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.840]   that you get ahead in this country, not on the color of your skin, but on the content
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.500]   of your character.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.520]   Free speech and open debate, not just as some sort of catchphrase, but the idea that any
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.840]   opinion, no matter how heinous, you get to express it in the United States of America.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Self-governance.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.000]   And this is a big one right now, is that the people we elect to run the government, they're
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.200]   no longer the ones who actually run the government.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   We in the conservative movement, I believe, should believe in restoring self-governance
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.880]   where it's not bureaucrats running the show, but actually elected representatives.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.120]   And then the other, the other ideal that the nation was founded on that I think we need
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.460]   to revive, and I think is a north star of the conservative movement, is restoring the
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.680]   rule of law in this country.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.920]   You think about even the abandonment of the rule of law at the southern border.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.480]   It's particularly personal to me as the kid of legal immigrants to this country.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.680]   You and I actually share a couple of aspects in common in that regard.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.560]   That also, though, means your first act of entering this country can't break the law.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.960]   So there's some policy commitments and principles, merit, free speech, self-governance, rule
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   of law.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.040]   And then I think culturally, what does it mean to be a conservative is it means we believe
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:49.200]   in the anchors of our identity in truth, the value of the individual, family, nation, and
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.000]   God, beat race, gender, sexuality, and climate, if we have the courage to actually stand for
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   our own vision.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.280]   And that's a big part of what's been missing.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.200]   And it's a big part of not just through the campaign, but through, you know, a lot of
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   my future advocacy.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.840]   That's the vacuum I'm aiming to fill.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.600]   So let's talk about each of those issues, immigration, the growing bureaucracy of government.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.680]   Religion is a really interesting topic, something you've spoken about a lot, but you've also
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.960]   had a lot of really tense debates.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.720]   So you're a perfect person to ask to steel man the other side.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   So let me ask you about progressivism.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.720]   Can you steel man the case for progressivism and left-wing ideas?
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.440]   So look, I think the strongest case, particularly for left-wing ideas in the United States,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.800]   or in the American context, is that the country has been imperfect in living up to its ideals.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.240]   So even though our founding fathers preached the importance of life, liberty, and the pursuit
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.220]   of happiness and freedom, they didn't practice those values in terms of many of our founding
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.440]   fathers being slave owners, inequalities with respect to women and other disempowered groups,
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.160]   such that they say that that created a power structure in this country that continues to
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.880]   last to this day.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.240]   The vestiges of what happened, even in 1860, in the course of human history isn't that
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.480]   long ago, and that we need to do everything in our power to correct for those imbalances
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.680]   in power in the United States.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.800]   That's the core view of the modern left.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.920]   I'm not criticizing it right now.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   I'm steel manning it.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.320]   I'm trying to give you, I think, a good articulation of why the left believes they have a compelling
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.720]   case for the government stepping in to correct for historical or present inequalities.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.200]   I can give you my counter-rebuttal of that, but the best statement of the left, I think
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.700]   that it's the fact that we've been imperfect in living up to those ideals.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.800]   In order to fix that, we're going to have to take steps that are severe steps, if needed,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.400]   to correct for those historical inequalities before we actually have true equality of opportunity
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   in this country.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.120]   That's the case for the left-wing view in modern America.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.800]   So what's your criticism of that?
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.880]   So my concern with it is even if that's well-motivated, I think that it recreates many of the same
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.680]   problems that they were setting out to solve.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.960]   I'll give you a really tangible example of that in the present right now.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.840]   I may be alone amongst prominent conservatives who would say something like this right now,
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.400]   but I think it's true, so I'm going to say it.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:18.160]   I'm actually, even in the last year, last year and a half, seeing actually a rise in
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.960]   anti-Black and anti-minority racism in this country, which is a little curious.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.080]   Right when, over the last 10 years, we got as close to Martin Luther King's promised
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.040]   land as you could envision, a place where you have every American, regardless of their
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.320]   skin color, able to vote without obstruction, a place where you have people able to get
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   the highest jobs in the land without race standing in their way.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.560]   Why are we seeing that resurgence?
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.920]   In part, it's because of, I believe, that left-wing obsession with racial equity over
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.880]   the course of the last 20 years in this country.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.560]   And so when you take something away from someone based on their skin color, and that's what
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.280]   correcting for prior injustice was supposed to do, the left-wing views are to correct
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.040]   for prior injustice by saying that whether you're a white, straight, cis man, you have
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.300]   certain privileges that you have to actually correct for.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.000]   When you take something away from somebody based on their genetics, you actually foster
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.640]   greater animus towards other groups around you.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   And so the problem with that philosophy is that it creates, there are several problems
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.480]   with it, but the most significant problem that I think everybody can agree we want to
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.960]   avoid is to actually fan the flames of the very divisions that you supposedly wanted
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   to heal.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.040]   I see that in a context of our immigration policy as well.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.920]   Think about even what's going on in, I'm from Ohio, I was born and raised in Ohio and I
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.400]   live there today, the controversy in Springfield, Ohio.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.780]   I personally don't blame really any of the people who are in Springfield, either the
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.400]   native people who were born and raised in Springfield, or even the Haitians who have
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.880]   been moved to Springfield, but it ends up becoming a divide and conquer strategy and
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.760]   outcome where if you put 20,000 people in a community where, 50,000 people where the
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   20,000 are coming in, don't know the language, are unable to follow the traffic laws, are
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.640]   unable to assimilate, you know there's going to be a reactionary backlash.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.120]   And so even though that began perhaps with some type of charitable instinct, some type
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.880]   of sympathy for people who went through the earthquake in 2010 in Haiti and achieved temporary
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.480]   protective status in the United States, what began with sympathy, what began with earnest
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.120]   intentions actually creates the very division and reactionary response that supposedly we
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   say we wanted to avoid.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.040]   So that's my number one criticism of that left-wing worldview.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:42.240]   Number two is I do believe that merit and equity are actually incompatible.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.120]   Merit and group quotas are incompatible.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.600]   You can have one or the other, you can't have both.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.080]   And the reason why is no two people, and I think it's a beautiful thing, it's true between
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.640]   you and I, between you and I and all of our friends or family or strangers or neighbors
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.600]   or colleagues, no two people have the same skill sets.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.920]   We're each endowed by different gifts.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.360]   We're each endowed with different talents.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.040]   And that's the beauty of human diversity.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.080]   And a true meritocracy is a system in which you're able to achieve the maximum of your
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   God-given potential without anybody standing in your way, but that means necessarily there's
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.640]   going to be differences in outcomes in a wide range of parameters, not just financial, not
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.680]   just money, not just fame or currency or whatever it is, there's just gonna be different outcomes
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.540]   for different people in different spheres of lives.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.160]   And that's what meritocracy demands, it's what it requires.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.080]   And so the left's vision of group equity necessarily comes at the cost of meritocracy.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.160]   And so those have been my two reasons for opposing the view is, one is it's not meritocratic,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.600]   but number two is it often even has the effect of hurting the very people they claimed to
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   have wanted to help.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.200]   And I think that's part of what we're seeing in modern America.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   - Yeah, you had a pretty intense debate with Mark Cuban, a great conversation.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.480]   I think it's on your podcast actually.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   - Yeah.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   - Yes.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.480]   That's great.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.080]   He messaged me all the time with beautifully eloquent criticism.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.480]   I appreciate that, Mark.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.920]   What was one of the more convincing things he said to you?
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.120]   You're mostly focused on kind of DEI.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.400]   - So let's just take a step back and understand, 'cause people use these acronyms and then
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.000]   they start saying it out of muscle memory and stop asking what it actually means.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.360]   DEI refers to capital D, diversity, equity, and inclusion, which is a philosophy adopted
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:34.440]   by institutions, principally in the private sector, companies, nonprofits, and universities
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.080]   to say that they need to strive for specific forms of racial, gender, and sexual orientation
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   diversity.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.400]   And it's not just the D, it's the equity in ensuring that you have equal outcomes as measured
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:51.720]   by certain group quota targets or group representation targets that they would meet in their ranks.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.240]   The problem with the DEI agenda is in the name of diversity, it actually has been a
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.560]   vehicle for sacrificing true diversity of thought.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.800]   So the way the argument goes is this, is that we have to create an environment that is receptive
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.520]   to minorities and minority views.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.840]   But if certain opinions are themselves deemed to be hostile to those minorities, then you
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.520]   have to exclude those opinions in the name of the capital D, diversity, but that means
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.400]   that you're necessarily sacrificing actual diversity of thought.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.240]   I can give you a very specific example.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.120]   That might sound like, okay, well, is it such a bad thing if an organization doesn't want
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   to exclude people who are saying racist things on a given day?
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.000]   We could debate that, but let's get to the tangible world of how that actually plays
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   out.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.160]   I, for my part, have not really heard in ordinary America, people uttering racial epithets if
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.360]   you're going to a restaurant or in the grocery store.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.880]   It's not something I've encountered, certainly not in the workplace, but that's a theoretical
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880]   case.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.240]   Let's talk about the real world case of how this plays out.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.720]   There was an instance, it was a case that presented itself before the Equal Employment
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.360]   Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, one of the government enforcers of the DEI agenda.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.640]   And there was a case of a woman who wore a red sweater on Fridays in celebration of veterans
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.920]   and those who had served the military and invited others in the workplace to do the
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.920]   same thing.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920]   And they had a kind of affinity group.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.760]   You could call it that, a veteran type affinity group appreciating those who had served.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.840]   Her son had served as well.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.560]   There was a minority employee at that business who said that he found that to be a microaggression.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.480]   So the employer asked her to stop wearing said clothes to the office.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.520]   Well, she still felt like she wanted to celebrate, I think it was Friday was the day of the week
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   where they did it.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.400]   She still wore the red sweater, she didn't wear it, but she would hang it on the back
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   of her seat, right?
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.160]   Put it on the back of her seat at the office.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.960]   They said, no, no, no, you can't do that either.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.600]   So the irony is in the name of this capital D diversity, which is creating a supposedly
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.880]   welcoming workplace for all kinds of Americans by focusing only on certain kinds of so-called
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.040]   diversity that translates into actually not even a diversity of your genetics, which is
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.280]   what they claim to be solving for, but also a hostility to diversity of thought.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   And I think that's dangerous.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.720]   And you're seeing that happen in the last four years across this country.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.240]   It's been pretty rampant.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.280]   I think it leaves America worse off.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.000]   The beauty of America is we're a country where we should be able to have institutions that
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.320]   are stronger from different points of view being expressed.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.520]   But my number one criticism of the DEI agenda is not even that it's anti meritocratic.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.240]   It is anti meritocratic, but my number one criticism is it's actually hostile to the
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:31.440]   free and open exchange of ideas by creating often legal liabilities for organizations
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.400]   that even permit certain viewpoints to be expressed.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   And I think that's the biggest concern.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:43.600]   I think what Mark would say is that diversity allows you to look for talent in places where
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.680]   you haven't looked before and therefore find really special talent, special people.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.000]   And I think that's the case he made.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   He did make that case.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It was a great conversation.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.680]   And my response to that is great.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   That's a good thing.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   We don't need a three letter acronym to do that.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   Right.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.800]   You don't need special programmatic DEI incentives to do it because companies are always going
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.280]   to seek in a truly free market, which I think we're missing in the United States today for
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.640]   a lot of reasons.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.360]   But in a truly free market, companies will have the incentive to hire the best and brightest
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.760]   or else they're going to be less competitive versus other companies.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:23.400]   But you don't need ESG, DEI, CSR regimes in part enforced by the government to do it today
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.700]   to be a government contractor, for example, you have to adopt certain racial and gender
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.120]   representation targets in your workforce.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.500]   That's not the free market working.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.640]   So I think you can't have it both ways.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.800]   Either it's going to be good for companies and companies are going to do what's in their
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   self-interest.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.600]   That's what capitalists like Mark Cuban and I believe.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.780]   But if we really believe that, then we should let the market work rather than forcing it
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.960]   to adopt these top down standards.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.640]   That's my issue with it.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.600]   I don't know what it is about human psychology, but whenever you have a sort of administration,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:57.480]   a committee that gets together to do a good thing, the committee starts to use the good
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:05.720]   thing, the ideology behind which there's a good ideal to bully people and to do bad things.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.080]   I don't know what it is.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   This has less to do with left wing versus right wing ideology and more the nature of
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:18.480]   a bureaucracy is one that looks after its own existence as its top goal.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.440]   So part of what you've seen with the so-called perpetuation of wokeness in American life
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:30.800]   is that the bureaucracy has used the appearance of virtue to actually deflect accountabilities
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.960]   for its own failure.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.640]   So you've seen that in several different spheres of American life.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.960]   You could even talk about in the military, right?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.120]   You think about our entry into Iraq after 9/11 had nothing to do with the stated objectives
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.400]   that we had.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.880]   And I think by all accounts, it was a policy move we regret.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.480]   Our policy ranks and our foreign policy establishment made a mistake in entering Iraq, invading
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.120]   a country that really, by all accounts, was not at all responsible for 9/11.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.920]   Nonetheless, if you're part of the U.S. military or you're General Mark Milley, you would rather
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.000]   talk about white rage or systemic racism than you would actually talk about the military's
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.620]   actual substantive failures.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.680]   It's what I call the practice of blowing woke smoke to deflect accountability.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.720]   You can say the same thing with respect to the educational system.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.240]   It's a lot easier to claim that, and I'm not the one making this claim, but others have
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.040]   made this claim, that math is racist because there are inequitable results on objective
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.920]   tests of mathematics based on different demographic attributes.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.840]   You can claim using that that math is racist.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.560]   It's a lot easier to blow that woke smoke than it is to accept accountability for failing
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.200]   to teach black kids in the inner city how to actually do math and fix our public school
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:49.660]   systems and the zip code coded mechanism for trapping kids in poor communities in bad schools.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.800]   So I think that in many cases what these bureaucracies do is they use the appearance of signaling
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.680]   this virtue as a way of not really advancing a social cause, but of strengthening the power
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.880]   of the bureaucracy itself and insulating that bureaucracy from criticism.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.440]   So in many ways, bureaucracy, I think, carves the channels through which much of this woke
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.120]   ideology has flowed over the last several years, and that's why part of my focus has
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.560]   shifted away from just combating wokeness, because that's just a symptom, I think, versus
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:27.920]   combating actual bureaucracy itself, the rise of this managerial class, the rise of the
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.920]   deep state.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.000]   And we talk about that in the government, but the deep state doesn't just exist in the
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   government.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.920]   It exists, I think, in every sphere of our lives, from companies to nonprofits to universities.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.680]   It's the rise of what we call the managerial class, the committee class, the people who
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.440]   professionally sit on committees, I think are wielding far more power today than actual
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.680]   creators, entrepreneurs, original ideators, and ordinary citizens alike.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.120]   Yeah, you need managers, but as few as possible.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:06.720]   It seems like when you have a giant managerial class, the actual doers don't get to do.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.880]   But like you said, bureaucracy is a phenomena of both the left and the right.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   This is not-
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.920]   It's not even a left or right, it just transcends that, but it's anti-American at its core.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.000]   So our founding fathers, they were anti-bureaucratic at their core, actually.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.360]   They were the pioneers, the explorers, the unafraid.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.720]   They were the inventors, the creators.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.560]   Don't forget this about Benjamin Franklin, who signed the Declaration of Independence,
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.320]   one of the great inventors that we have in the United States as well.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.080]   He invented the lightning rod.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.160]   He invented the Franklin stove, which was actually one of the great innovations in the
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.960]   field of thermodynamics.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.480]   He even invented a number of musical instruments that Mozart and Beethoven went on to use.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   That's just Benjamin Franklin.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.160]   So you think, "Oh, he's a one-off."
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.840]   Everybody's like, "Okay, he was the one zany founder who was also a creative scientific
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.960]   innovator who happened to be one of the founders of the country."
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.960]   Wrong.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   It wasn't unique to him.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.400]   You have Thomas Jefferson.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.840]   What are you sitting in right now?
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.960]   You're sitting on a swivel chair.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   Who invented the swivel chair?
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   Thomas Jefferson?
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   Yes, Thomas Jefferson.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.920]   Funny enough, he invented the swivel chair while he was writing the Declaration of Independence,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   which is insane.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:20.200]   You're the one that reminded me that he drafted, he wrote the Declaration of Independence when
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   he was 33.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.760]   And he was 33 when he did it, while inventing the swivel chair.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.960]   I like how you're focused on the swivel chair.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.060]   Can we just pause on the Declaration of Independence?
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.400]   It makes me feel horrible.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.040]   The Declaration of Independence part, everybody knows.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.960]   What people don't know, he was an architect.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.860]   So he worked in Virginia, but the Virginia State Capitol Dome, so the building that's
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.480]   in Virginia today, where the State Capitol is, that dome was actually designed by Thomas
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.120]   Jefferson as well.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.400]   So these people weren't people who sat on professional committees.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   They weren't bureaucrats.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.900]   They hated bureaucracy.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:58.160]   Part of Old World England is Old World England was committed to the idea of bureaucracy.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.960]   Bureaucracy and monarchy go hand in hand.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.120]   A monarch can't actually administer or govern directly.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:10.200]   It requires a bureaucracy, a machine to actually technocratically govern for him.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.000]   So the United States of America was founded on the idea that we reject that old world
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   view.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Right?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.820]   The old world vision was that we, the people, cannot be trusted to self-govern or make decisions
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.040]   for ourselves.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.080]   We would burn ourselves off the planet, is the modern version of this.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.380]   With existential risks like global climate change, if we just leave it to the people
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.480]   and their democratic will, that's why you need professional technocrats, educated elites,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.640]   enlightened bureaucrats to be able to set the limits that actually protect people from
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.040]   their own worst impulses.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.240]   That's the old world view.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.320]   And most nations in human history have operated this way.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.720]   But what made the United States of America itself, to know what made America great, we
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.680]   have to know what made America itself.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.440]   What made America itself is we said hell no to that vision, that we the people, for better
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.280]   or worse, are going to self-govern without the committee class restraining what we do.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.040]   And the likes of Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, and I could give you examples of John Adams
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.840]   or Robert Livingston.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.240]   You go straight down the list of founding fathers who were inventors, creators, pioneers,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.040]   explorers, who also were the very people who came together to sign the Declaration of Independence.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.800]   And so, yeah, this rise of bureaucracy in America in every sphere of life, I view it
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.480]   as anti-American, actually.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.680]   And I hope that, you know, conservatives and liberals alike can get behind my crusade,
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.080]   certainly, to get in there and shut most of it down.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   Yes.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:42.040]   Speaking of shutting most of it down, how do you propose we do that?
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.600]   How do we make government more efficient?
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.160]   How do we make it smaller?
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.760]   What are the different ideas of how to do that?
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.440]   Well, the first thing I will say is you're always taking a risk.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.320]   Okay, there's no free lunch here, mostly, at least.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.560]   You're always taking a risk.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.000]   One risk is that you say, "I want to reform it gradually.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.680]   I want to have a grand master plan and get to exactly what the right end state is, and
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.280]   then carefully cut with a chisel, like a work of art, to get there."
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.640]   I don't believe that approach works.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.080]   I think that's an approach that conservatives have taken for many years.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.740]   I think it hasn't gotten us very far.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.360]   And the reason is, if you have like an eight-headed hydra and you cut off one of the heads, it
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.400]   grows right back.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.520]   The other risk you could take, so that's the risk of not cutting enough.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.560]   The other risk you could take is the risk of cutting too much, to say that I'm going
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.720]   to cut so much that I'm going to take the risk of not just cutting the fat, but also
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.640]   cutting some muscle along the way, that I'm going to take that risk.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.040]   I can't give you option C, which is to say that I'm going to cut exactly the right amount,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   I'm going to do it perfectly.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.920]   Okay, you don't know ex ante, you don't know beforehand that it's exactly how it's going
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   to go.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.920]   So that's a meaningless claim.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.440]   It's only a question of which risk you're going to take.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.400]   I believe in the moment we live in right now, the second risk is the risk we have to be
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   willing to take.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:01.960]   And we haven't had a class of politician, and Donald Trump in 2016 was I think the closest
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   we've gotten.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.520]   I think the second term will be even closer to what we need.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:12.060]   But short of that, I don't think we've really had a class of politician who has gotten very
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:17.400]   serious about cutting so much that you're also going to cut some fat, but not only some
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.600]   fat, but also some muscle.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   That's the risk we have to take.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:26.200]   So what would the way I would do it, 75% headcount reduction across the board in the federal
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.440]   bureaucracy, send them home packing, shut down agencies that shouldn't exist, rescind
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.560]   every unconstitutional regulation that Congress never passed.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.960]   In a true self governing democracy, it should be our elected representatives that make the
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.260]   laws and the rules, not an unelected bureaucrats.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.620]   And that is the single greatest form of economic stimulus we could have in this country.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.560]   But it is also the single most effective way to restore self governance in our country
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.340]   as well.
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.460]   And it is the blueprint for I think how we save this country.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.180]   That's pretty gangster, 75%.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:08.620]   There's this kind of almost meme like video of Argentinian President Javier Mele wearing
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.620]   a white board.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:16.740]   He has all the, I think 18 ministries lined up and he's like, he's ripping like the Department
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   of Education gone.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.900]   And he's just going like this.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.940]   Now the situation in Argentina is pretty dire.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:32.040]   And the situation in the United States is not, despite everybody saying, oh, the empire
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.940]   is falling, this is still, in my opinion, the greatest nation on earth.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.020]   Still the economy is doing very well.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.940]   Still there's, this is the hub of culture, the hub of innovation, the hub of so many
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.660]   amazing things.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:56.580]   Do you think it's possible to do something like firing 75% of people in government when
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.620]   things are going relatively well?
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.620]   Yes.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.020]   In fact, I think it's necessary and essential.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.220]   I think things are depends on, depends on what your level of well really is, what you're
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.100]   benchmarking against.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.100]   America is not built on complacency, right?
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.420]   We're built on the pursuit of excellence.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.020]   And are we still the greatest nation on planet earth?
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.020]   I believe we are.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.860]   I agree with you on that.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.860]   But are we great as we could possibly be, or even as we have been in the past measured
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.100]   against our own standards of excellence?
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.100]   No, we're not.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.660]   I think the nation is in a trajectory of decline.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.760]   It doesn't mean it's the end of the empire yet, but we are a nation in decline right
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   now.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.580]   I don't think we have to be, but part of that decline is driven by the rise of this managerial
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.420]   class, the bureaucracy sucking the lifeblood out of the country, sucking the lifeblood
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.460]   out of our innovative culture, our culture of self-governance.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.460]   So is it possible?
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.460]   Yeah, it's really possible.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.900]   I mean, I'll tell you one easy way to do it.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.940]   This is a little bit, I'm being a little bit glib here, but I think it's not crazy, at
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.100]   least as a thought experiment.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.780]   Get in there on day one, say that anybody in the federal bureaucracy who was not elected,
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.820]   elected representatives obviously were elected by the people, but of the people who were
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.060]   not elected, if your social security number ends in an odd number, you're out.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.780]   If it ends in an even number, you're in.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.220]   There's a 50% cut right there.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:19.540]   Of those who remain, if your social security number starts in an even number, you're in,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.580]   and if it starts with an odd number, you're out.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.580]   Boom.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.260]   That's a 75% reduction.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.380]   And literally, stochastically, okay?
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.620]   One of the virtues of that, it's a thought experiment, not a policy prescription, but
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.540]   one of the virtues of that thought experiment is that you don't have a bunch of lawsuits
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.340]   you're dealing with about gender discrimination or racial discrimination or political viewpoint
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.340]   discrimination.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.540]   Actually, the reality is you've, at mass, you didn't bring the chisel, you brought a
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.540]   chainsaw.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.580]   I guarantee you, do that on day one and do step two on day two.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.780]   On day three, not a thing will have changed for the ordinary American other than the size
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.120]   of their government being a lot smaller and more restrained, spending a lot less money
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.060]   to operate it.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.700]   And most people who run a company, especially larger companies, know this.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.620]   It's 25% of the people who do 80 to 90% of the useful work.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.700]   These government agencies are no different.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.260]   So now imagine you could do that same thought experiment, but not just doing it at random,
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.820]   but do it still at large scale while having some metric of screening for those who actually
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.420]   had both the greatest competence as well as the greatest commitment and knowledge of the
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.420]   Constitution.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:32.860]   That, I think, would immediately raise not only the civic character of the United States.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.660]   Now we feel, OK, the people we elect to run the government, they've got the power back.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.740]   They're running the government again, as opposed to the unelected bureaucrats who wield the
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.220]   power today.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.220]   It would also stimulate the economy.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.820]   I mean, the regulatory state is like a wet blanket on the American economy.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.620]   Most of it's unconstitutional.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:53.620]   All we require is leadership with a spine to get in there and actually do what conservative
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:59.300]   presidents have maybe gestured towards and talked about but have not really effectuated
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.020]   ever in modern history.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:05.060]   And by the way, that kind of thing would attract the ultra-competent that actually want to
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.060]   work in government.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.060]   Exactly.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.060]   Which you're missing today.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.380]   Because right now, the government would swallow them up.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.220]   Most competent people feel like that bureaucratic machine will swallow them whole.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.860]   You clear the decks of 75% of them, real innovators can then show up.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:23.340]   Yeah, you know, there's kind of this cynical view of capitalism where people think that
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.060]   the only reason you do anything is to earn more money.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.060]   But I think a lot of people would want to work in government to build something that's
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.020]   helpful to a huge number of people.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:40.460]   Yeah, well, look, I think there's opportunities for the very best to have large-scale impact
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:45.780]   in all kinds of different institutions, in our universities, to K-12 education, through
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.780]   entrepreneurship.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.260]   I'm obviously very biased in that regard.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.740]   I think there's a lot you're able to create that you couldn't create through government.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.100]   But I do think in the moment that we live in, where our government is as broken as it
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:03.140]   is and is as responsible for the declining nature of our country, yeah, I think bringing
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:09.820]   in people who are unafraid, talented and able to have an impact could make all of the difference.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.500]   And I agree with you, I don't think actually most people, even most people who say they're
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.140]   motivated by money, I don't think they're actually motivated by money.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:25.220]   I think most people are driven by a belief that they can do more than they're being permitted
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.700]   to do right now with their skill sets.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.440]   See, I've never, I'll tell you that, so I've run a number of companies and one of the things
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:37.460]   that I used to ask when I was, you know, I'm not day-to-day involved in them anymore, but
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:42.260]   as a CEO, I would ask when I did interviews and the first company I started at Roivent,
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.540]   like for four years in, I mean, we're, you know, company was pretty big by that point.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:52.300]   I would still intend on interviewing every candidate before they joined, screening for
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.060]   the culture of that person.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.380]   I can talk a lot more about things we did to build that culture, but one of the questions
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.380]   I would always ask them naturally just to start a conversation, it's a pretty basic
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:07.420]   question is why did you leave your last job or why are you leaving your last job?
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.900]   I'll tell you what I didn't hear very often is that I wasn't paid enough, right?
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.300]   Maybe they'd be shy to tell you that during an interview, but there's indirect ways to
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:20.220]   signal that, that really wasn't at all, like even a top 10 reason why people were leaving
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.220]   their job.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.220]   I'll give you what the number one reason was, is that they felt like they were unable to
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:31.820]   do the true maximum of what their potential was in their prior role.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.640]   That's the number one reason people leave their job.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.740]   And you know, I think by the way, that's, I would say that as I'm saying that in a self
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.340]   boastful way that we would attract these people.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.580]   I think that's also true for most of the people who left the company as well, Roivent, right?
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.720]   And it's, and that was true at Roivent, it's true at other companies I've started.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.860]   I think the number one reason people join companies and the number one reason people
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.060]   leave companies, whether they've been to join mine or to leave mine in the past have been
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.420]   that they feel like they're able to do more than they're able to with their skillset than
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.140]   that environment permits them to actually achieve.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.860]   And so I think that's what people hung for.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.360]   When we think about capitalism and true free market capitalism, and we used words earlier
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:15.120]   like meritocracy, it's about building a system, whether it's in a nation or whether it's even
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.580]   within an organization that allows every individual to flourish and achieve the maximum of their
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.580]   potential.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.980]   And sometimes it just doesn't match for an organization where let's say the mission is
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.740]   here and somebody's skillsets could be really well aligned to a different mission, then
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.100]   the right answer is, it's not a negative thing.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.380]   It's just that that person needs to leave and find their mission somewhere else.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.500]   But to bring that back to government, I think part of what's happened right now is that
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:44.220]   the rise of that bureaucracy in so many of these government agencies has actually obfuscated
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.180]   the mission of these agencies.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.900]   I think if you went to most federal bureaucracies and just asked them, like, what's the mission?
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.660]   I'm just making one up off the top of my head right now, the Department of Health and Human
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.820]   Services.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:33:00.700]   What is the mission of HHS in the United States of America?
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.320]   I doubt somebody who works there, even the person who leads it could give you a coherent
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.140]   answer to that question.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.780]   I just I just heavily doubt it.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:12.140]   And you could fill in the blank for, you know, over any range of the Department of Commerce.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.900]   I mean, I could go straight down the list of each of these other ones.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.980]   What is the mission of this organization?
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.260]   You could even say for the US military, what's the purpose of the US military, the Department
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.260]   of Defense?
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.260]   I can give you one.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:27.060]   The purpose is to win wars and more importantly, through its strength to avoid wars.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.060]   That's it.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.940]   Well, OK, if that's the mission, then, you know, OK, it's not tinkering around and messing
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.900]   around in some foreign conflict where we kind of feel like it sometimes and other ones where
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.900]   we don't.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   And who decides that?
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.900]   I don't really know.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   But whoever the people are that decide that we follow those orders.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:46.460]   No, our mission is to protect the United States of America, to win wars and to avoid wars.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.460]   Boom.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.460]   Those three things.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.460]   What does protecting the United States of America mean?
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.340]   The first one, the homeland of the United States of America and the people who reside
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.340]   there.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.980]   OK, that's a clear mission.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.940]   I mean, the Department of Health and Human Services maybe could be a reasonable mission
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.500]   to say that I want to make America the healthiest country on planet Earth and we will develop
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.900]   the metrics and meet those metrics.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:09.980]   And that's the goal of the Department of HHS, to set policies or at least to implement policies
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.780]   that best achieve that goal.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.780]   But you can't.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.180]   And maybe that's the right statement of the mission.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.180]   Maybe it's not.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.740]   But one of the things that happens is when you're governed by the committee class, it
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:23.900]   dilutes the sense of mission out of any organization, whether it's a company or a government agency
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.220]   or bureaucracy.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.700]   And once you've done that, then you lose the ability to attract the best and the brightest,
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.740]   because in order for somebody to achieve the maximum of their potential, they have to know
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.740]   what it's towards.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.180]   There has to be a mission in the first place.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.700]   Then you're not getting the best and brightest.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.060]   You get more from the committee class.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.760]   And that becomes a self-perpetuating downward spiral.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.900]   And that is what the blob of the federal bureaucracy really looks like today.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.980]   You said something really profound.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.660]   At the individual scale of the individual contributor, doer, creator, what happens is
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.660]   you have a certain capacity to do awesome shit.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.140]   And then there's barriers that come up where you have to wait a little bit.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.620]   This happens, there's friction always.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.200]   When humans together are working on something, there's friction.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:09.340]   And so the goal of a great company is to minimize that friction, minimize the number of barriers.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.900]   And what happens is the managerial class, the incentive is for it to create barriers.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.900]   That's what it does.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:21.700]   I mean, that's just by the nature of a bureaucracy, it creates sand in the gears to slow down
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.420]   whatever the other process was.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.500]   Is there some room for that somewhere in certain contexts?
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   Sure.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.660]   It's like a defensive mechanism that's designed to reduce dynamism.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:38.340]   But I think when that becomes cancerous in its scope, it then actually kills the host
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.540]   itself, whether that's a school, whether that's a company, whether that's a government.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:49.380]   And so the way I think about it, Lex, is there's sort of a balance of distributed power, and
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:54.380]   I don't mean power in the Foucault sense of social power, but I mean just sort of power
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.860]   in the sense of the ability to effect relevant change in any organization between what you
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.740]   could call the founder class, the creator class, the everyday citizen, the stakeholder
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.220]   class, and then the managerial class.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.020]   And there's a role for all three of them, right?
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.500]   You could have the constituents of an organization, say, in a constitutional republic, that's
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.660]   the citizen.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.340]   You could have the equivalent of the creator class, the people who create things in that
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.820]   polity.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.860]   And then you have the bureaucratic class that's designed to administer and serve as a liaison
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.220]   between the two.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:30.940]   I'm not denying that there's some role somewhere for people who are in that managerial class.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.060]   But right now, in this moment in American history, and I think it's been more or less
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.660]   true for the last century, but it's grown, starting with Woodrow Wilson's advent of the
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.180]   modern administrative state, metastasizing through FDR's New Deal and what was required
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:51.100]   to administer it, blown over and metastasizing further through LBJ's Great Society, and everything
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.780]   that's happened since, even aided and abetted by Republican presidents along the way, like
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:01.740]   Richard Nixon, has created a United States of America where that committee class, both
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:07.620]   in and outside the government and our culture, wields far too much influence and power relative
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:13.340]   to the everyday citizen stakeholder and to the creators who are, in many ways, constrained,
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:18.780]   hamstrung, shackled in a straitjacket from achieving the maximum of their own potential
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.780]   contributions.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.900]   And, you know, I certainly feel that myself.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.380]   You know, I probably identify as being a member of that creator class most closely.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.380]   It's just what I've done.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.100]   I create things.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.940]   And I think we live in an environment in the United States of America where we're still
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.380]   probably the best country on Earth, where that creator has that shot, so that's the
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:41.900]   positive side of it, but one where we are far more constrictive to the creator class
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.820]   than we have been when we've been at our best.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.820]   And that's where I want to see change.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:50.740]   Can you sort of steel man the perspective of somebody that looks at a particular department,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:57.560]   Department of Education, and are saying that the amount of pain that would be caused by
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.260]   closing it and firing 75% of people will be too much?
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.980]   Yeah, so I go back to this question of mission, right?
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:12.180]   A lot of people who make arguments for the Department of Education aren't aware why the
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.260]   Department of Education was created in the first place, actually, so that might be a
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.020]   useful place to start, is that this thing was created.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.560]   It had a purpose, presumably.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   What was that purpose?
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.140]   It might be at least a relevant question to ask before we decide what are we doing with
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.140]   it or not.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.620]   What was the purpose of this thing that we created?
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.620]   It's not a...
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:35.220]   To me, it seems like a highly relevant question, yet in this discussion about government reform,
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.260]   it's interesting how eager people are to skip over that question and just to talk about,
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.100]   "Okay, but we got the status quo and it's just going to be disruptive," versus asking
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.900]   the question of, "Okay, this institution was created.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.260]   It had an original purpose.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.000]   Is that purpose still relevant?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.620]   Is this organization at all fulfilling that purpose today?"
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.360]   To me, those are some relevant questions to ask, so let's talk about that for the Department
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.900]   of Education.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:03.120]   Its purpose was relevant at that time, which was to make sure that localities and particularly
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:10.740]   states were not siphoning dollars, taxpayer dollars, away from predominantly black school
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.060]   districts to predominantly white ones.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.100]   That was not a theoretical concern at the time.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.620]   It was happening, or there was at least some evidence that that was happening in certain
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.940]   states in the South.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.380]   You may say you don't like the federal solution.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.540]   You may say you like the federal solution, but like it or not, that was the original
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.700]   purpose of the U.S. Department of Education to make sure that from a federal perspective,
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   states were not systematically disadvantaging black school districts over predominantly
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.560]   white ones.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:42.340]   However noble and relevant that purpose may have been six decades ago, it's not a relevant
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.340]   purpose today.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.820]   There's no evidence today of states intentionally mapping out which are the black versus white
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.620]   school districts and siphoning money in one direction versus another.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.580]   To the contrary, one of the things we've learned is that the school districts in the inner
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:02.100]   city, many of which are predominantly black, actually spend more money per student than
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.460]   other school districts for a worse result as measured by test scores and other performance
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.580]   on a per student basis, suggesting that there are other factors than the dollar expenditures
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:17.180]   per school determining student success, and actually suggesting that even the overfunding
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.700]   of some of those already poorly run schools rewards them for their actual bureaucratic
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.240]   failures.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.220]   So against that backdrop, the Department of Education has instead extrapolated that original
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.740]   purpose of what was a racial equality purpose to instead implement a different vision of
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.460]   racial equity through the ideologies that they demand in the content of the curriculum
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.620]   that these public schools actually teach.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.380]   So Department of Education funding, so federal funding accounts for about, you know, giving
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:49.100]   you round numbers here, but around 10% of the funding of most public schools across
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.460]   the country.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.440]   But that comes with strings attached.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.740]   So in today's Department of Education, this didn't happen back in 1970, but it's happening
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.740]   today.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.300]   Ironically, it's funny how these things change with the bureaucracies that fail, they blow
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.860]   oak smoke to cover up for their own failures.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:08.700]   What happens with today's Department of Education, they effectively say you don't get that funding
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:14.580]   unless you adopt certain goals deemed at achieving racial or gender equity goals.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.540]   And in fact, they also intervene in the curriculum where there's evidence of schools in the Midwest
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.740]   or in the Great Plains that have been denied funding because Department of Education funding
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.860]   so long as they have certain subjects like archery.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.460]   There was one instance of a school that had archery in its curriculum.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.180]   I find that to be pretty interesting, actually, I think that I think you have different kinds
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.180]   of physical education.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.580]   This is one that combines mental focus with physical aptitude, but hey, maybe I'm biased,
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.700]   doesn't matter whether you like archery or not.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.700]   I don't think it's the federal government's job to withhold funding from a school because
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.940]   they include something in their curriculum that the federal government deems inappropriate,
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:53.700]   where that locality found that to be a relevant locus of education.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.700]   So what you see then is an abandonment of the original purpose that's long past.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:01.620]   You don't have this problem that the Department of Education was originally formed to solve
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:05.860]   of siphoning money from black school districts to white school districts and laundering that
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.740]   effectively in public funds.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.920]   That doesn't exist anymore.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.900]   So they find new purposes instead, creating a lot more damage along the way.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.060]   So you asked me to steel man it and could I say something constructive rather than just,
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.300]   you know, pounding down on the other side?
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:25.940]   One way to think about this is for a lot of these agencies, were many of them formed with
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.700]   a positive intention at the outset?
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.580]   Yes.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.380]   Whether that positive intention existed.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.500]   I'm still a skeptic of creating bureaucracies, but if you're going to create one, at least
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.020]   make it.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.820]   Which we call it a task force, make it a task force.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.860]   A task force versus agency means after it's done, you celebrate, you've done your work,
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:55.300]   pat yourself on the back and then move on rather than creating a standing bureaucracy, which
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:00.620]   actually finds things to do after it has already solved or addressed the first reason it was
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   born in the first place.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.060]   And I think we don't have enough of that in our culture.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.940]   I mean, even if you have a company that's generated tons of cash flow and it's solved
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.460]   a problem, let's say it's a let's say it's a biopharmaceutical company that developed
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.740]   a cure to some disease.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.820]   And the only thing people knew at that company was how to develop a cure to that disease.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.620]   And they generated a boatload of cash from doing it.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.700]   At a certain point, you could just give it to your shareholders and close up shop.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.900]   And that's actually a beautiful thing to do.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.740]   You don't see that happen enough in the American consciousness, in the American culture of
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:32.500]   when an institution has achieved its purpose, celebrate it and then move on.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.260]   And I think that that culture in our government would result in a vastly restrained scope
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.140]   of government rather than today.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.140]   It's a one way ratchet.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.380]   Once you cause it to come into existence, you cause new things to come into existence.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.120]   But the old one that came into existence continues to persist and exist as well.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.900]   And that's where you get this metastasis over the last century.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:56.100]   So what kind of things do you think government should do that the private sector, the forces
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.780]   of capitalism would create drastic inequalities or create the kind of pain we don't want to
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.780]   have in government?
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.060]   So if the question is what should government do that the private sector cannot, I'll give
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.580]   you one.
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.580]   Protect our border.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.660]   I mean, capitalism, it's never gonna be the job of capitalists or never gonna be the capability
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.780]   or inclination of capitalists to preserve a national border.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:20.100]   And I think a nation is literally, I think one of the chapters of this book, OK, a nation
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.740]   without borders is not a nation.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.100]   It's almost a tautology.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.260]   An open border is not a border.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.540]   Capitalism is not gonna solve that.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.980]   What's gonna solve that is a nation.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.540]   Part of the job of the federal government is to protect the homeland of its nation.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.540]   In this case, the United States of America.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.700]   That's an example of a proper function of the federal government to provide physical
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.640]   security to its citizens.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:45.300]   Another proper role of that federal government is to look after, or in this case could be
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:53.040]   state government, to make sure that private parties cannot externalize their costs onto
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.840]   somebody else without their consent.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.580]   It's a fancy way economists would use to describe it.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.580]   What does that mean?
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.460]   It means if you go dump your chemicals in somebody else's river, then you're liable
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.460]   for that.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.200]   It's not that, OK, I'm a capitalist, and so I want to create things, and I'm gonna do
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.500]   hell or high water, whether or not that harms people around me.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.680]   The job of a proper government is to make sure that you protect the rights of those
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:19.060]   who may be harmed by those who are pursuing their own rights through a system of capitalism.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.260]   In seeking prosperity, you're free to do it.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:26.500]   But if you're hurting somebody else without their consent in the process, the government
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.180]   is there to enforce what is really just a different form of enforcing a private property
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.440]   right.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.840]   So I would say that those are two central functions of government, is to preserve national
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.920]   boundaries and the national security of a homeland, and number two is to protect and
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.800]   preserve private property rights and the enforcement of those private property rights.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.580]   And I think at that point, you've described about 80 to 90% of the proper role of a government.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.580]   What about infrastructure?
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.500]   Look, I think that most infrastructure can be dealt with through the private sector.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.780]   I mean, you can get into specifics, you could have infrastructure that's specific to national
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:45:59.780]   security.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.140]   No, I do think that military industrial base is essential to provide national security.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.420]   That's a form of infrastructure.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.640]   I don't think you could rely exclusively on the private sector to provide the optimal
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.220]   level of that protection to a nation.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.920]   But you know, interstate highways, you know, I think you could think about whether or not
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.740]   that's a common good that everybody benefits from, but nobody has the incentive to create.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.860]   I think you could make an argument for the existence of interstate highways.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.980]   I think you could also make powerful arguments for the fact that actually, you could have
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:32.080]   enough private sector co-ops that could cause that to come into existence as well.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.660]   But you know, I'm not gonna be, I'm not dogmatic about this, but broadly speaking, 80 to 90%
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.540]   of the goal of the federal government, I'm not gonna say 100, 80 to 90% of the goal of
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:47.980]   the existence of a federal government should be to, of government period, should be to
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:52.380]   protect national boundaries and provide security for the people who live there, and to protect
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.360]   the private property rights of the people who reside there.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.180]   If we restore that, I think we're well on our way to a revival of what our founding
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.180]   fathers envisioned.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.820]   And I think many of them would give you the same answer that I just did.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:09.980]   So if we get government out of education, would you be also for reducing this as a government
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.100]   in the states for something like education?
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:18.460]   I think here, if it goes closer to municipalities and the states, I'm fine with that being a
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.340]   locus for people determining as, for example, let's just say school districts are taxed
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:26.900]   at the local level, for that to be a matter for municipalities and townships to actually
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:31.340]   decide democratically how they actually want that governed, whether it's balanced between
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:35.900]   a public school district versus making that same money available to families in the form
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:41.060]   of vouchers or other forms of ability to educational savings accounts or whichever mechanism it
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.780]   is to opt out of that.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.780]   If that's done locally, I'll have views on that that tend to go further in the direction
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.980]   of true educational choice and diversity of choice.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.340]   The implementation of charter schools, the granting of state charters, or even lowering
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.080]   the barriers to granting one, I favor those kinds of policies.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.660]   But if we've gotten the federal government out of it, that's achieved 75% of what I think
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.980]   we need to achieve, that I'm focused on solving other problems and leave that to the states
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.540]   and municipalities to cover from there.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.220]   >> So given this conversation, what do you think of Elon's proposal of the Department
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:21.820]   of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration or really any administration?
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.660]   >> I'm, of course, biased because Elon and I had discussed that for the better part of
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.020]   the last year and a half, and I think it's a great idea.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.420]   I had something that's very consistent with the core premise of my presidential candidacy.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.660]   I got to know him as I was running for US president in a couple of events that he came
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.580]   to and then we built a friendship after that.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.000]   So obviously, I think it's a great idea.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.860]   >> Who do you think is more hardcore on the cutting, you or Elon?
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.900]   >> Well, I think Elon is pretty hardcore.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:55.220]   I said 75% of the federal bureaucrats, and while I was running for president, he said
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.460]   you need to put at least 75%.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.820]   So I agree with him.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:04.180]   I think I would, I think it'd be a fun competition to see who ends up more hardcore.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.820]   I think he and I, I don't think there's someone out there who's going to be more hardcore
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.260]   than here I would be.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:15.780]   And the reason is, I think we're both, we share in common a willingness to take the
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.780]   risk and see what happens.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:20.660]   I mean, the sun will still rise in the east and set in the west, that much I guarantee
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:21.660]   you.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.460]   Is there going to be some broken glass and some damage?
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.460]   Yes, there is.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.300]   There's no way around that.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.460]   But once you're willing to take that risk, then it doesn't become so scary anymore.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.820]   And here's the thing, Lex, it's easy to say this, let's talk about where the rubber hits
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.100]   the road here.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:40.260]   Even in a second Trump term, this would be the discussion, President Trump and I've had
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:45.060]   this conversation, but I think we would continue to have this conversation, is where does it
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.060]   rank on our prioritization list?
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.900]   Because there's always going to be a trade-off.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.620]   If you have a different policy objective that you want to achieve, a good policy objective,
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:56.860]   whatever that is, right?
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:01.220]   You could talk about immigration policy, you could talk about economic policy, there are
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:08.140]   other policy objectives, you're going to trade off a little bit in the short run, the effectiveness
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:13.020]   of your ability to carry out that policy goal, if you're also committed to actually thinning
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.140]   out the federal government by 75%, because there's just going to be some clunkiness,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.140]   right?
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.220]   And there's just going to be frictional costs for that level of cut.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.420]   So the question is, where does that rank on your prioritization list?
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:28.620]   To pull that off, to pull off a 75% reduction in the size and scale of the federal government,
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:34.060]   the regulatory state and the headcount, I think that only happens if that's your top
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.060]   priority.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.580]   You could do it at a smaller scale, but at that scale, it only happens if that's your
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:42.500]   top priority, because then as president, you're in a position to say, I know in the super
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:47.340]   short run, that might even make it a little bit harder for me to do this other thing that
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:52.660]   I want to do and use the regulatory state to do it, but I'm going to pass on that.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:53.660]   I'm going to pass that up.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.180]   I'm going to bear that hardship and inconvenience because I know this other goal is more important
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.380]   on the scale of decades and centuries for the country.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.420]   So it's a question of prioritization.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:10.700]   And certainly my own view is that now is a moment where that needs to be a top priority
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.500]   for saving this country.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:19.100]   And if there's one thing about my campaign, if I was to do it again, I would be even clearer
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.380]   about, because I talked about a lot of things in the campaign and we can cover a lot of
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.380]   that too.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.620]   But if there's one thing that I care about more than anything else is dismantling that
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:33.740]   bureaucracy and more of moreover, it is a, it's an assault and a crusade on the nanny
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.980]   state itself.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:37.660]   And that nanny state presents itself in several forms.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:41.300]   There's the entitlement state, that's the welfare state presents itself in the form
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.300]   of the regulatory state.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.780]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.860]   And then there's the foreign nanny state where effectively we are subsidizing other countries
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.640]   that aren't paying their fair share of protection or other resources.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   We provide them.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:58.520]   If I was to summarize my ideology in a nutshell, it is to terminate the nanny state in the
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:03.640]   United States of America, in all of its forms, the entitlement state, the regulatory state
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.080]   and the foreign policy nanny state.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.680]   Once we've done that, we've revived the Republic that I think would make George Washington
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.680]   proud.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:16.240]   So you mentioned department of education, but there's also the department of defense
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:25.040]   and there's a very large number of very powerful people that have gotten used to, and a budget
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.520]   that's increasing and the number of wars and military conflicts that's increasing.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:35.680]   So if we could just talk about that, so this is the number one priority.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:42.800]   It's like there's difficulty levels here, the DOD would be probably the hardest.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.920]   So let's take that on.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:50.360]   What's your view on the military industrial complex, department of defense and wars in
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.360]   general?
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.120]   So I think the nanny state, I'm against it overall.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.080]   I'm against the foreign policy nanny state as well.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.760]   Let's let me start from that as the starting off point, then I'll tell you about my views
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.080]   on the DOD and our defense.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.720]   First of all, I think that, and I think that it was easy for many people from the neocon
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.500]   school of thought to caricature my views with the media at their side.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.720]   But actually my own view is if it's in the interest of the United States of America to
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:20.160]   provide certain levels of protection to US allies, we can do that as long as those allies
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.240]   actually pay for it.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.180]   And I think that's important for two reasons.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.960]   The less important reason, still important reason, the less important reason is it's
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.200]   still money for us, right?
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:34.160]   It's not like we're swimming in a cash surplus right now, we're a $34 trillion national debt
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.160]   and growing.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.960]   And, you know, I think pretty soon the interest payments are going to be the largest line
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.440]   item in our own federal budget.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.400]   So it's not like we have money willy nilly to just hand over for free.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.280]   That's the less important reason though.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:53.000]   The more important reason is that it makes sure that our allies have actual skin in the
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.020]   game to not have skewed incentives to actually enter conflicts where they're not actually
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.520]   bearing the full cost of those conflicts.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:07.680]   So take NATO, for example, most NATO countries, literally a majority of NATO countries today
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:16.840]   do not pay or contribute 2% of their GDP to their own national defense, which is supposedly
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.320]   a requirement to be in NATO.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   So majority of NATO countries are failing to meet their basic commitment to be in NATO
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.880]   in the first place.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.520]   Germany particularly is, I think, arbitraging the hell out of the United States of America.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:33.960]   And I don't think that I'm not going to be some sort of, you know, shrill voice here
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:39.000]   saying so therefore we should not be supporting any allies or providing security blankets.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   No, I'm not.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   I'm not going in that direction.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.320]   What I would say is you got to pay for it, right?
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   Pay for your fissure.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.600]   A, because we're not swimming in excess money ourselves.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:51.800]   But B is it tells us that you actually have skin in the game for your own defense, which
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:56.520]   actually then makes nations far more prudent in the risks that they take, whether or not
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.640]   they enter war versus if somebody else is paying for it and somebody else is providing
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.560]   our security guarantee, hey, I might as well, you know, take the gamble and see where I
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:07.200]   end up at the end of a war versus the restraint that that imposes on the decision making of
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.080]   those allies.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.440]   So now let's bring this bring this home to the Department of Defense.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:20.360]   I think the top goal of the U.S. defense policy establishment should be to provide for the
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.200]   national defense of the United States of America.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.680]   And the irony is that's what we're actually doing most poorly.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.360]   We're not really using other than the Coast Guard.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.500]   We're not really using the U.S. military to prevent crossings at our own southern border
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.920]   and crossings at our other borders.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.880]   In fact, the United States of America, our homeland, I believe, is less secure today
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.440]   than it has been in a very long time.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:47.080]   Vulnerable to threats from hypersonic missiles, where China and Russia, Russia certainly has
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:50.760]   capabilities in excess of that of the United States missiles.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.360]   Hypersonic means faster than the speed of sound that could hit the United States, including
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.340]   those carrying nuclear warheads.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:56:01.080]   We are more vulnerable to super EMP attacks, electromagnetic pulse attacks that could,
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.840]   you know, without exaggeration, some of this could be from other nations.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:09.340]   Some of this could even be from solar flares, cause significant mass casualty in the United
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.340]   States of America.
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.340]   The electric grid's gone.
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:14.740]   It's not an exaggeration to say if that happened, planes would be falling out of the sky because
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:19.740]   our chips really depend on those electromagnetic well, will be affected by those electromagnetic
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.000]   pulses.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   More vulnerable to cyberattacks.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.480]   I know this, oh, people start yawning and say, okay, boring stuff, super EMP, cyber,
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   whatever.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.840]   No, actually it is pretty relevant to whether or not you actually are facing the risk of
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.800]   not getting your insulin because your refrigerator doesn't work anymore or your food can't be
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:42.400]   stored or your car or your, or your ability to fly in an airplane is impaired.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.440]   Okay.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.080]   So I think that these are serious risks where our own national defense spending has been
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.360]   wholly inadequate.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.420]   So I'm not one of these people that says, oh, we decreased versus increased national
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:53.420]   defense spending.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.160]   We're not spending it in the right places.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.980]   The number one place we need to be spending it is actually protecting our national defense.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.920]   And I think our protecting our own physical homeland.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.320]   And I think we actually need an increase in spending on protecting our own homeland.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:11.280]   But that is different from the agenda of foreign interventionism and foreign nanny state ism
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.960]   for its own stake, where we should expect more and demand more of our allies to provide
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.120]   for their own national defense and then provide the relevant security guarantees to allies
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.360]   where that actually advances the interests of the United States of America.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.940]   So that's what I believe.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.220]   And you know, I think this process has been corrupted by what Dwight Eisenhower famously
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:33.920]   in his farewell address called the military industrial complex in the United States.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.120]   But I think it's, it's bigger than just the, you know, I think it's easy to tell the tales
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.880]   of the financial corruption.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:45.080]   It's a kind of cultural corruption and conceit that just because certain number of people
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:50.200]   in that expert class have a belief that their belief happens to be the right one because
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.680]   they can scare you with what the consequence would be if you don't follow their advice.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.520]   And one of the beauties of the United States is at least in principle, we have civilian
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.720]   control of the military.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.940]   The person who we elect to be the US president is the one that actually is the true commander
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.940]   in chief.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.000]   I have my doubts of whether it operates that way.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.120]   I think it's quite obvious that Joe Biden is not a functioning commander in chief of
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.480]   the United States of America, yet on paper, supposedly, we still are supposed to call
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.400]   him that.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:22.000]   But at least in theory, we're supposed to have civilian control of the US military.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.240]   And I think that one of the things that that leader needs to do is to ask the question
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.920]   of, again, the mission, what's the purpose of this US military in the first place, at
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:36.040]   the top of the list should be to protect the homeland, the people who actually live here,
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   which we're failing to do.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.360]   So that's where I land on that question.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.480]   Wait, okay, there's a lot of stuff to ask.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:44.200]   First of all, on Joe Biden, you mean he's functionally not in control of the US military
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:48.400]   because of the age factor or because of the nature of the presidency?
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.600]   It's a good question.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:54.300]   I would say in his case, it's particularly accentuated because it's both.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:59:00.720]   In his case, I don't think anybody in America anymore believes that Joe Biden is the functioning
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.520]   president of the United States of America.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.520]   How could he be?
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.400]   He wasn't even sufficiently functioning to be the candidate after a debate that was held
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.520]   in June.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.760]   There's no way he's going to be in a position to make the most important decisions on a
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:15.640]   daily and demanding basis to protect the leading nation in the world.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.480]   Now, more generally, though, I think we have a deeper problem that even when it's not Joe
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:24.640]   Biden, in general, the people we elect to run the government haven't really been the
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.120]   ones running the government.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.840]   It's been the unelected bureaucrats and the bureaucratic deep state underneath that's
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.680]   really been making the decisions.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.800]   I've done business in a number of places.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.960]   I've traveled to Japan, and there's an interesting corporate analogy.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:44.520]   Sometimes if you get outside of politics, people can, I find, listen and pay attention
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:49.880]   a little bit more because politics is so fraught right now that if you start talking to somebody
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.060]   who disagrees with you about the politics of it, you're just butting heads but not really
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.060]   making progress.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:57.900]   So let's just make the same point but go outside of politics for a second.
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.900]   So I was traveling to Japan.
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:05.040]   I was having a late night dinner with a CEO of a Japanese pharmaceutical company.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.900]   And it takes a while to really get them to open up, culturally speaking in Japan, a couple
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:17.580]   nights of karaoke and whatnot, maybe late night restaurant, whatever it is.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.660]   We built a good enough relationship where he was very candid with me.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.060]   He said, "I'm the CEO of the company.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.740]   I could go and find the head of a research unit and tell him, 'Okay, this is a project
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.520]   we're no longer working on as a company.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.620]   We don't want to spend money on it.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.620]   We're going to spend money somewhere else.'"
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.140]   And he'll look me in the eye and he'll say, "Yes, sir.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140]   Yes, sir."
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.580]   I'll come back six months later and find that they're spending exactly the same amount of
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.220]   money on those exact same projects, and I'll tell him, "No, we agreed.
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.340]   I told you that you're not going to spend money on this project, and we have to stop
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.340]   now.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.340]   It should have stopped six months ago.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.340]   Get a slap on the wrist for it."
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.340]   He says, "Yes, sir.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.340]   Yes.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.340]   No, no, no.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.340]   Of course, that's correct."
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:01.820]   The same person is spending the same money on the same project, and here's why.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.880]   Historically in Japan, and I should say in Japan, this is changing now.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.540]   It's changing now, but historically, until very recently, and even to an extent now,
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.580]   it's near impossible to fire people.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:18.540]   So if somebody works for you and you can't fire them, that means they don't actually
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.020]   work for you.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:25.220]   It means in some deeper, perverse sense, you work for them because you're responsible for
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:29.920]   what they do without any authority to actually change it.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.220]   So I think most people who've traveled in Japan and Japanese corporate culture through
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:38.880]   the 1990s and 2000s and 2010s, and maybe even some vestiges in the 2020s, wouldn't really
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.300]   dispute what I just told you.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.220]   Now we're bringing it back to the more contentious terrain.
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.300]   I think that's basically how things have worked in the executive branch of the federal government
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.060]   of the United States of America.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.860]   You have these so-called civil service protections on the books.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:57.660]   Now, if you really read them carefully, I think that there are areas to provide daylight
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:02.860]   for a truly constitutionally well-trained president to act.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:08.060]   But apart from those, that's a contrarian view that I have that bucks conventional wisdom,
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:12.520]   but apart from that caveat, in general, the conventional view has been the US president
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.380]   can't fire these people.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:18.860]   There's 4 million federal bureaucrats, 99.9% of them can't be touched by the person who
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:23.500]   the people who elected to run the executive branch can't even fire those people.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.820]   It's like the equivalent of that Japanese CEO.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.120]   And so that culture exists every bit as much in the federal bureaucracy of the United States
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.900]   of America as they did in Japanese corporate culture through the 1990s.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:38.860]   And that's a lot of what's wrong with not just the way that our Department of Defense
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.340]   is run and our foreign policy establishment is run, but I think it applies to a lot of
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:46.180]   the domestic policy establishment as well.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.740]   And to come back to the core point, how are we going to save this republic?
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.460]   This is the debate in the conservative movement right now.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:56.460]   So this is a little bit, maybe a little bit spicy for some Republicans to sort of swallow
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.460]   right now.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:03.060]   And, you know, my top focus is making sure that we win the election, but let's just move
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.780]   the ball forward a little bit and skate to where the puck is going here.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.780]   Okay.
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:09.220]   Yes, let's say we win the election all as well and dandy.
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.220]   Okay.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.220]   What's the philosophy that determines how we govern?
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:15.360]   There's a little bit of a fork in the road amongst conservatives where there are those
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:21.160]   who believe that the right answer now is to use that regulatory state and use those levers
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:29.460]   of power to advance our own pro conservative, pro American, pro worker goals.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.180]   And I'm sympathetic to all of those goals, but I don't think that the right way to do
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:39.500]   it is to create a conservative regulatory state that replaces a liberal regulatory state.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.700]   I think the right answer is actually to get in there and shut it down.
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:46.260]   I don't want to replace the left wing nanny state with a right wing nanny state.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.740]   I want to get in there and actually dismantle the nanny state.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.940]   And I think it has been a long time in the United States, maybe ever in modern history
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:01.860]   that we've had a conservative leader at the national level who makes it their principal
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:08.060]   objective to dismantle the nanny state in all of its forms, the entitlement state, the
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:12.600]   regulatory state, and the foreign policy nanny state.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.400]   That was a core focus of my candidacy.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.580]   One of the things that I wish, and this is on me, not anybody else, that I should have
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:27.880]   done better was to make that more crystal clear as a focus without getting distracted
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.980]   by a lot of the shenanigans, let's just say, that happen as sideshows during a presidential
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:34.980]   campaign.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.600]   But call that a lesson learned because I do think it's what the country needs now more
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600]   than ever.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.720]   Yeah, it's a really, really powerful idea.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.620]   It's actually something that Donald Trump ran on in 2016.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.620]   Drain the swamp.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.620]   Drain the swamp.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:56.020]   I think by most accounts, maybe you can disagree with me, he did not successfully do so.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.460]   He did fire a bunch of people, more than usual.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.020]   Can I say a word about the conditions he was operating in?
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:06.020]   Because I think that's why I'm far more excited for this time around, is that a lot has changed
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.720]   in the legal landscape.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:14.560]   So Donald Trump did not have the Supreme Court backdrop in 2016 that he does today.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.420]   So there's some really important cases that have come down from the Supreme Court.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.860]   One is West Virginia versus EPA.
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:23.160]   I think it's probably the most important case of our generation.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:29.520]   In 2022, that came down and said that if Congress has not passed a rule into law itself through
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.100]   the halls of Congress, and it relates to what they call a major question, a major policy
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:39.300]   or economic question, it can't be done by the stroke of a pen by a regulator, an unelected
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.540]   bureaucrat either.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:45.280]   That quite literally means most federal regulations today are unconstitutional.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.160]   Then this year comes down a different, a big one, another big one from the Supreme Court
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:54.200]   in the Loper-Bright case, which held that historically, for the last 50 years in this
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.960]   country, the doctrine has been, it's called Chevron deference.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.800]   It's a doctrine that says that federal courts have to defer to an agency's interpretation
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.940]   of the law.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.800]   They now toss that out the window and said, no, no, no, the federal courts no longer have
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.500]   to defer to an agency's interpretation of what the law actually is.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:18.380]   The combination of those two cases is seismic in its impact for the regulatory state.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:23.820]   There's also another great case that came down was SEC versus JARCSE, and the SEC is
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:27.320]   one of these agencies that embodies everything we're talking about here.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:33.740]   The SEC, among other agencies, has tribunals inside that not only do they write the rules,
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:38.480]   not only do they enforce those rules, they also have these judges inside the agency that
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   also interpret the rules and determine and dole out punishments.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.460]   That doesn't make sense if you believe in separation of powers in the United States,
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.940]   so the Supreme Court put an end to that and said that that practice at the SEC is unconstitutional.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:53.900]   Actually, as a side note, the Supreme Court has said countless practices and rules written
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:59.040]   by the SEC, the EPA, the FTC in recent years were outright unconstitutional.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.980]   Think about what that means for a constitutional republic, that supposedly these law enforcement
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:10.800]   agencies, the courts have now said, especially this year, the courts have now said that their
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.360]   own behaviors actually break the law.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.560]   So the very agencies entrusted with supposedly enforcing the law are actually behaving with
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.320]   utter blatant disregard for the law itself.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320]   That's un-American.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.880]   It's not tenable in the United States of America, but thankfully we now have a Supreme Court
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.680]   that recognizes that.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:38.880]   So whether or not we have a second Trump term, that's up to the voters, but even whether
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:44.520]   or not that now takes advantage of that backdrop the Supreme Court has given us to actually
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.520]   gut the regulatory state, we'll find out.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520]   I am optimistic.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.000]   I certainly think it's the best chance that we've had in a generation in this country.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.360]   That's a big part of why I'm supporting Donald Trump and why I'm going to do everything in
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.720]   my power to help him.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.520]   But I do think it is going to take a spine of steel to see that through.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.500]   And then after we've taken on the regulatory state, I think that's the next step.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.680]   But I do think there's this broader project of dismantling the nanny state in all of its
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:18.240]   forms, the entitlement state, the regulatory state, and the foreign policy in any state.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.560]   Three word answer, if I was to summarize my worldview and my presidential campaign in
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.000]   three words, shut it down.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   Shut it down.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Okay.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.160]   So the Supreme Court cases you mentioned, there's a lot of nuance there.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.480]   I guess it's weakening the immune system of the different departments.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.080]   It's a good way of putting it.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.080]   Okay.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:44.480]   On the human psychology level, so you basically kind of implied that for Donald Trump or for
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.440]   any president, the legal situation was difficult.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.400]   Is that the only thing really operating?
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:09:00.040]   Like isn't it also just on a psychological level just hard to fire a very large number
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.040]   of people?
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040]   Is that what it is?
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   Like why?
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.760]   Is there a basic civility and momentum going on?
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   Well, I think there's one other factor.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.880]   So you're right to point.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:13.000]   I mean, the legal backdrop is a valid and understandable excuse and reason.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.400]   I think there are other factors at play too.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:21.080]   So I think there's something to be said for never having been in government, showing up
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:26.160]   there the first time and you're having to understand the rules of the road as you're
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:33.360]   operating within them and also having to depend on people who actually aren't aligned with
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.860]   your policy vision, but tell you to your face that they are.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:39.880]   And so I think that's one of the things that I've admired about president Trump is he's
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:44.000]   actually been very open about that, very humble about that, to say that there's a million
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.720]   learnings from that first term that make him ambitious and more ambitious in that second
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   term.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.920]   But everything I'm talking to you about, this is what needs to happen in the country.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.840]   It's not specific to Donald Trump, it lays out what needs to be done in the country.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.600]   There's the next four years, Donald Trump is our last, best hope and chance for moving
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.280]   that ball forward.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.520]   But I think that the vision I'm laying out here is one that hopefully goes even beyond
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.040]   just the next two or four years of really fixing a century's worth of mistakes.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.600]   I think we're gonna fix a lot of them in the next four years of Donald Trump's president.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.920]   But if you have a century's worth of mistakes that have accumulated with the overgrowth
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.700]   of the entitlement state in the US, I think it's going to take, you know, probably the
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.360]   better part of a decade at least to actually fix them.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:31.560]   I disagree with you on both the last and the best hope.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:37.040]   Donald Trump is more likely to fire a lot of people, but is he the best person to do
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040]   so?
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.040]   We've got two candidates, right?
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040]   People face a choice.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040]   This is a relevant election.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.600]   One of my goals is to speak to people who may not agree with 100% of what Donald, who
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.760]   do not agree with 100% of what Donald Trump says.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.160]   And I can tell them, you know what, I don't agree with 100% of what he says.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.360]   And I can tell you, as somebody who ran against him for US president, that right now he is,
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.720]   when I say the last best hope, I mean in this cycle, the last best hope that we have for
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.120]   dismantling that bureaucratic class.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.320]   And you know, I think that I'm also open about the fact that it's going to take, this is
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.680]   a long run project, but we have the next step to actually, the next step to actually take
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.720]   over the next few years.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:16.720]   That's kind of where I land on it.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.520]   I mean, you talked to him, I guess a few weeks ago, I saw you had a podcast with him, right?
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.220]   What was your impression about his preparedness to do it?
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.400]   My impression is his priority allocation was different than yours.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.700]   I think he's more focused on some of the other topics that you are also focused on.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.320]   And there is a tension there, just as you've clearly highlighted.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.560]   We share the same priority with respect to the Southern border and those are near term
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.920]   fixes that we can hit out of the park in the first year.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.760]   But at the same time, I think we got to think also on decade long time horizon.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:54.040]   So my own view is, I think that he, it is my conviction and belief that he does care
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.220]   about dismantling that federal bureaucracy, certainly more so than any Republican nominee
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.120]   we have had in, certainly in my lifetime.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.160]   But I do think that there are going to be competing schools of thought where some will
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.440]   say, okay, well, we want to create a right wing entitlement state, right?
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.840]   Do a shower federal subsidies on favored industries while keeping them away from disfavored industries
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.840]   and new bureaucracies to administer them.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.920]   And, you know, I don't come from that school of thought.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.440]   I don't want to see the bureaucracy expand in a pro-conservative direction.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.720]   I want to see the bureaucracy shrink in every direction.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.260]   And you know, I do think that from my conversation with Donald Trump, I believe that he is well
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:38.240]   aligned with this vision of shrinking bureaucracy, but that's a longer term project.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.480]   There's so many priorities at play here, though.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.520]   I mean, you really do have to do the Elon thing of walking into Twitter headquarters,
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.760]   shut it down with a sink, right?
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.760]   Let that sink in, that basically firing a very large number of people.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.720]   And it's not just about the firing, it's about setting clear missions for the different departments
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:05.560]   that remain, hiring back because you overfire, hiring back based on meritocracy.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:12.640]   And it's a full-time, and it's not only full-time in terms of actual time, it's full-time psychologically
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:19.680]   because you're walking into a place, unlike a company like Twitter, an already successful
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:26.440]   company, in government, I mean, everybody around you, all the experts and the advisors
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.680]   are going to tell you you're wrong.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:36.120]   And like, it's a very difficult psychological place to operate in because like you're constantly
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:44.280]   the asshole, and I mean, the certainty you have to have about what you're doing is just
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.040]   like nearly infinite because everybody, all the really smart people are telling you, "No,
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.520]   this is a terrible idea.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.120]   Sir, this is a terrible idea."
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.480]   No, you have to have this spine of steel to cut through what that short-term advice is
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.680]   you're getting.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:04.520]   And I'll tell you, certainly I intend to do whatever I can for this country, both in the
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.920]   next four years and beyond, but my voice on this will be crystal clear, and President
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.640]   Trump knows that's my view on it, and I believe he shares it deeply, is that all else equal,
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.360]   get in there and shut down as much of the excess bureaucracy as we can, do it as quickly
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.960]   as possible, and that's a big part of how we save our country.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:30.120]   Okay, I'll give you an example that's really difficult tension given your priorities, immigration.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.240]   There's an estimated 14 million illegal immigrants in the United States.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.760]   You've spoken about mass deportation.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   Yes.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:47.240]   That requires a lot of effort, money, I mean, how do you do it, and how does that conflict
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.520]   with the shutting it down?
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.040]   Sure, and so it goes back to that original discussion we had is what are the few proper
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.600]   roles of the federal government?
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.400]   I gave you two.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.640]   One is of the government period.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.800]   One is to protect the national borders and sovereignty of the United States, and two
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.080]   is to protect private property rights.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   There's a lot else.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.880]   Most of what the government's doing today, both at the federal and state level, is something
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.840]   other than those two things, but in my book, those are the two things that are the proper
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.420]   function of government.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.920]   So for everything else the federal government should not be doing, the one thing they should
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.160]   be doing is to protect the homeland of the United States of America and the sovereignty
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.220]   and sanctity of our national borders.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:27.680]   So in that domain, that's mission aligned with a proper purpose for the federal government.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.680]   I think we're a nation founded on the rule of law.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.880]   I say this as the kid of legal immigrants.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.440]   That means your first act of entering this country cannot break the law, and in some
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.040]   ways, if I was to summarize a formula for saving the country over the next four years,
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:46.080]   it would be a tale of two mass deportations, the mass deportations of millions of illegals
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.240]   who are in this country and should not be, and then the mass deportation of millions
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.240]   of unelected federal bureaucrats out of Washington, D.C.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.920]   Now all of a sudden, you could say that those are intention, but I think that the reality
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.280]   is anything outside of the scope of what the core function of the government is, which
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.680]   is protecting borders and protecting private property rights, that's really where I think
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.000]   the predominant cuts need to be, and if you look at the number of people who are looking
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.600]   after the border, it's not even 0.1% of the federal employee base today.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:22.480]   So 75% isn't 99.99%, it's 75%, which still leaves that it would still be a tiny fraction
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.800]   of the remaining 25%, which I actually think needs to be more rather than less.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.600]   So it's a good question, but that's sort of where I land on.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.000]   When it's a proper role of the federal government, great, act and actually do your job.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.200]   The irony is 99.9999% of those resources are going to functions other than the protection
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:43.120]   of private property rights and the protection of our national physical protection.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.840]   There is a lot of criticism of the idea of mass deportation, though.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:54.200]   One, it will cause a large amount of economic harm, at least in the short term.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:00.320]   The other is there would be potentially violations of our kind of higher ideals of how we like
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.400]   to treat human beings, in particular separation of families, for example, tearing families
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.480]   apart.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.160]   And the other is just like the logistical complexity of doing something like this.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.720]   How do you answer some of those criticisms?
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.720]   Fair enough.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.320]   And I would call those even not even criticisms, but just thoughtful questions, right?
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.720]   Even if somebody who's really aligned with doing this, those are thoughtful questions
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.080]   to ask.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.760]   So I do want to say something about this point on how we think about the breakage of the
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.280]   rule of law in other contexts.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:36.160]   There are 350,000 mothers who are in prison in the United States today who committed crimes
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.780]   and were convicted of them.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.940]   They didn't take their kids with them to those prisons either, right?
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:45.160]   So we face difficult trade-offs in all kinds of contexts as it relates to the enforcement
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.160]   of law.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.100]   And I just want to make that basic observation against the backdrop of if we're a nation
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:54.980]   founded on the rule of law, that we acknowledge that there are trade-offs to enforcing the
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.980]   law.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:59.780]   And we've acknowledged that in other contexts, I don't think that we should have a special
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:03.900]   exemption for saying that somehow we weigh the other way when it comes to the issue of
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.900]   the border.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:08.740]   We're a nation founded on the rule of law, we enforce laws that has costs, that has trade-offs,
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.220]   but it's who we are.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:15.820]   So that backdrop is, and the easiest fact I can cite is 350,000 or so mothers who are
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:19.380]   in prison and did not take their kids to prison with them.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.380]   Is that bad?
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.500]   Is it undesirable for kids to grow up without those 350,000 mothers?
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.140]   It is.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:31.140]   But it's a difficult situation created by people who violated the law and faced the
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.420]   consequences of it, which is also a competing and important priority in the country.
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.680]   So that's in the domestic context.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.080]   As it relates to this question of mass deportations, let's just get very practical because all
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.120]   that was theoretical.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.880]   Very practically, there's ways to do this, starting with people who have already broken
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   the law, people who have not just broken the law of entering, but are committing other
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.500]   crimes while already here in the United States.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.320]   That's a clear case for an instant mass deportation.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.920]   You have a lot of people who haven't integrated into their communities.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.600]   You think about the economic impact of this, a lot of people are in detention already.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.840]   A lot of those people should be immediately returned to their country of origin, or at
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.600]   least what is called a safe third country.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.260]   So safe third country means even if somebody is claiming to seek asylum from political
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.900]   persecution, we'll move them to another country that doesn't have to be the United States
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:19.200]   of America that they passed through, say Mexico, before actually coming here.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.240]   Other countries around the world are doing this.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.480]   Australia is detaining people.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.560]   They don't let them out and live a normal, joyful life because they came to the country.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.680]   They detain them until their case is adjudicated.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.960]   Well, the rates of fraud in Australia of what people lie about what their conditions are
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.760]   is way lower now than in the United States because people respond to those incentives.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.240]   So I think that in some ways, people make this sound much bigger and scarier than it
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240]   needs to be.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.980]   I've never taken a deeply pragmatic approach, and the North Star for me is I want the policy
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.360]   that helps the United States citizens who are already here.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.360]   What's that policy?
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.320]   Clearly, that's going to be a policy that includes a large number of deportations.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.920]   I think by definition, it's going to be the largest mass deportation in American history.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.660]   Sounds like a punchline at a campaign rally, but actually, it's just a factual statement
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:08.860]   that says if we've had the by far largest influx of illegal immigrants in American history,
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.860]   it just stands to reason.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:12.000]   It's logic that, okay, if we're going to fix that, we're going to have the largest mass
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.400]   deportation in American history.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.120]   And we can be rational.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.300]   Start with people who are breaking the law in other ways here in the United States.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.160]   Start with people who are already in detention or entering detention now.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.040]   That comes at no cost and strict benefit.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.680]   There isn't even a little bit of an economic trade-off.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.240]   Then you get to areas where you would say, okay, the costs actually continue to outweigh
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.520]   the benefits, and that's exactly the way our policy should be guided here.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:40.560]   I want to do it in as respectful and as humane of a manner as possible.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.080]   I mean, the reality is I think one of the things we got to remember, I'll give you the
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.000]   example I gave with the Haitian case in Springfield, a town that I spent a lot of time in growing
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   up in Ohio.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.480]   I live about an hour from there today.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.840]   I don't blame the individual Haitians who came here.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.280]   I'm not saying that they're bad people, because in that particular case, those weren't even
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.760]   people who broke the law in coming here.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.440]   They came as part of a program called Temporary Protective Status.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:10.040]   Now the operative word there is the first one, temporary.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.080]   They have been all kinds of lawsuits, there have been all kinds of lawsuits for people
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.680]   who even eight, 10, 12, 14 years after the earthquake in Haiti, where many of them came,
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.240]   when they're going to be removed, there are allegations of racial discrimination or otherwise.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.480]   No, Temporary Protective Status means it's temporary, and we're not abandoning the rule
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:32.200]   of law when we send them back, we're abandoning the rule of law when we let them stay.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.880]   Now if that has a true benefit to the United States of America, economically or otherwise,
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:39.960]   go through the paths that allow somebody to enter this country for economic reasons.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.320]   But don't do it through asylum-based claims or Temporary Protective Status.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:49.680]   I think one of the features of our immigration system right now is it is built on a lie,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.040]   and it incentivizes lying.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:57.440]   The reason is the arguments for keeping people in the country, if those are economic reasons,
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:02.240]   but the people actually entered using claims of asylum or refugee status, those two things
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.920]   don't match up.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.040]   So just be honest about what our immigration system actually is.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.120]   I think we do need dramatic reforms to the legal immigration system to select purposely
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.100]   for the people who are going to actually improve the United States of America.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.440]   I think there are many people, I know some of them, right?
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.720]   I gave a story of one guy who I met who is educated at our best universities or among
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.720]   our best universities.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.320]   He went to Princeton, he went to Harvard Business School, he has a great job in the investment
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.320]   community, he was a professional tennis player, he was a concert pianist, he could do a Rubik's
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.000]   Cube in less than a minute.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.120]   I'm not making this stuff up.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.440]   These are hard facts.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.960]   He can't get a green card in the United States.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.280]   He's been here for 10 years or something like this.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.280]   He asked me for the best advice I could give him.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:46.000]   I unfortunately could not give him the actual best advice, which would be to just take a
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.440]   flight to Mexico and cross the border and claim to be somebody who is seeking asylum
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.400]   in the United States.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.360]   That would have been morally wrong advice, so I didn't give it to him.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.440]   But practically, if you were giving him advice, that would be the best advice that you actually
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.000]   could give somebody, which is a broken system on both sides.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.500]   People who are going to make those contributions to the United States and pledge allegiance
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.080]   to the United States and speak our language and assimilate, we should have a path for
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.760]   them to be able to add value to the United States, yet they're not the ones who are getting
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:13.760]   in.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.080]   Our immigration system selects for people who are willing to lie.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]   That's what it does.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.240]   It selects for people who are willing to say they're seeking refugee status or seeking
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.600]   asylum when in fact they're not, and then we have policymakers who lie after the fact
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.240]   using economic justifications to keep them here.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.740]   But if it was an economic justification, that should have been the criteria you used to
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:34.960]   bring them in the first place, not this illusion of asylum or refugee status.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.720]   There was a case, actually even the New York Times reported on this, believe it or not,
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:49.600]   of a woman who came from Russia fleeing Vladimir Putin's intolerant anti-LGBTQ regime.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.640]   She was fleeing persecution by the evil man, Putin.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.440]   She came here and eventually when she was pressed on the series of lies, it came out
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.720]   that — and she was crying finally when she broke down and admitted this — she was like,
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.320]   "I'm not even gay.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.160]   I don't even like gay people."
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:09.260]   That's what she said, and yet she was pretending to be some sort of LGBTQ advocate who was
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:13.440]   persecuted in Russia when in fact it was just somebody who was seeking better economic conditions
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   in the United States.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.360]   I'm not saying you're wrong to seek better economic conditions in the United States,
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.680]   but you are wrong to lie about it, and that's what you're seeing a lot of people even in
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:26.400]   this industry of sort of "tourism" to the United States.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.080]   They're having their kids in the United States.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.800]   They go back to their home country, but their kids enjoy birthright citizenship.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   That's built on a lie.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.640]   You have people claiming to suffer from persecution.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.440]   In fact, they're just working in the United States and then living in these relative mansions
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.800]   in parts of Mexico or Central America after they've spent four or five years making money
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800]   here.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   Just abandon the lie.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.480]   Let's just have an immigration system built on honesty.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:47.640]   Just tell the truth.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:51.600]   If the argument is that we need more people here for economically fulfilling jobs, I'm
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.240]   skeptical the extent to which a lot of those arguments actually end up being true, but
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.440]   let's have that debate in the open rather than having it through the back door saying
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.120]   that it's refugee and asylum status when we know it's a lie, and then we justify it after
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.880]   the fact by saying that that economically helps the United States.
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:04.880]   Cut the dishonesty.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.480]   And I just think that that is a policy we would do well to expand every sphere.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:14.360]   We talk about from the military-industrial complex to the rise of the managerial class
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:18.400]   to a lot of what our government's covered up about our own history to even this question
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.920]   of immigration today.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.040]   Just tell the people the truth, and I think our government would be better serving our
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.040]   people if it did.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:29.040]   Yeah, in the way you describe eloquently, the immigration system is broken in that way
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:35.760]   that it's built fundamentally on lies, but there's the other side of it.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.960]   Illegal immigrants are used in political campaigns for fear-mongering, for example.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:48.560]   So what I would like to understand is what is the actual harm that illegal immigrants
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560]   are causing?
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:26:00.520]   So one of the more intense claims is of crime, and I haven't studied this rigorously, but
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:06.320]   sort of the surface-level studies all show that legal and illegal immigrants commit less
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.440]   crime than U.S. citizens.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.400]   I think that is true for legal immigrants.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.400]   I think it's not true for illegal immigrants.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.400]   That's not what I saw.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:20.280]   And sort of in this part of why I wrote this book, OK, and I mean, the book is called Truths,
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.280]   so I better darn well have well-sourced facts in here, right?
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.400]   Can't be made-up hypotheses, hard truths.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.000]   And there's a chapter where even in my own research on it, Lex, I mean, I know a lot
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.460]   about this issue from my time as a presidential candidate, but even in writing the chapter
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:39.880]   on the border here, I learned a lot from a lot of different dimensions, and some of which
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:45.800]   even caused me to revise some of my premises going into it, OK?
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.760]   My main thesis in that chapter is forget the demonization of illegal or legal immigrants
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.940]   or whatever, as you put it, right, fearmongering, just put all that to one side.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:02.520]   I want an immigration system that is built on honesty.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.220]   Identify what the objective is.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.220]   We could debate the objectives.
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.540]   We might have different opinions on the objectives.
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.480]   Some people may say the objective is the economic growth of the United States.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.780]   I make that, I air that argument in this book.
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:16.600]   And I think that that's insufficient, personally.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.900]   Personally, I think you need, the United States is more than just an economic zone.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:24.880]   It is a country, it is a nation bound together by civic ideals.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.480]   I think we need to screen not just for immigrants who are going to make economic contributions,
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.280]   but those who speak our language, those who are able to assimilate, and those who share
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.200]   those civic ideals and know the US history even better than the average US citizen who's
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.200]   here.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.240]   That's what I believe.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.040]   But even if you disagree with me and say, no, no, no, the sole goal is economic production
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:47.360]   in the United States, then at least have an immigration system that's honest about that
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:53.120]   rather than one which claims to solve for that goal by bringing in people who are rewarded
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.440]   for being a refugee.
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.320]   We should reward the people in that model, which is, I don't even think should be the
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.520]   whole model, but even if that were your model, reward the people who are demonstrated, have
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.180]   demonstrably proven that they would make economic contributions to the United States, not the
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:11.200]   people who have demonstrated that they're willing to lie to achieve a goal.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.800]   And right now, our immigration system, if it rewards one quality over any other, there's
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.360]   one parameter that it rewards over any other.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.400]   It isn't civic allegiance to the United States.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.880]   It isn't fluency in English.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.820]   It isn't the ability to make an economic contribution to this country.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:30.360]   The number one attribute, human attribute that our immigration system rewards is whether
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.760]   or not you are willing to lie.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:37.340]   And the people who are telling those lies about whether they're seeking asylum or not
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:41.340]   are the ones who are most likely to get in, and the people who are most unwilling to tell
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.960]   those lies are the ones who are actually not getting in.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:49.780]   That is a hard, uncomfortable truth about our immigration system.
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:54.900]   And the reason is because the law says you only get asylum if you're going to face bodily
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:29:00.140]   harm or near-term risk of bodily injury based on your religion, your ethnicity, or certain
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.500]   other factors.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.280]   And so when you come into the country, you're asked, "Do you fulfill that criteria or not?"
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.360]   And the number one way to get into this country is to check the box and say yes.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.920]   So that means just systematically, imagine if you're a university, Harvard or Yale or
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.480]   whatever, you're running your admissions process.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.360]   The number one attribute you're selecting for isn't your SAT score, isn't your GPA,
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.960]   isn't your athletic accomplishments, it's whether or not you're willing to lie on the
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:23.960]   application.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:29.200]   You're going to have a class populated by a bunch of charlatans and frauds.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.680]   That's exactly what our immigration system is doing to the United States of America,
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.420]   is it is literally selecting for the people who are willing to lie.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.760]   Let's say you have somebody who's a person of integrity, says, "Okay, I want a better
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.780]   life for my family, but I want to teach my kids that I'm not going to lie or break the
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.200]   law to do it."
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:48.260]   That person is infinitely less likely to get into the United States.
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:53.760]   I know it sounds provocative to frame it that way, but it is not an opinion.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.800]   It is a fact that that is the number one human attribute that our current immigration system
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.520]   is selecting for.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.760]   I want an immigration system centered on honesty.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:05.840]   In order to implement that, we require acknowledging what the goals of our immigration system are
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.200]   in the first place.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.680]   And there we have competing visions on the right.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.080]   Amongst conservatives, there's a rift.
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:15.440]   Some conservatives believe, I respect them for their honesty, I disagree with them, believe
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:20.560]   that the goal of the immigration system should be to, in part, protect American workers from
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.480]   the effects of foreign wage competition.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.800]   That if we have immigrants, it's going to bring down prices, and we need to protect
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.520]   American workers from the effects of that downward pressure on wages.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.520]   It's a goal.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   It's a coherent goal.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.280]   I don't think it's the right goal, but many of my friends on the right believe that's
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.280]   a goal.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.000]   But at least it's honest, and then we can design an honest immigration system to achieve
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.840]   that goal if that's their goal.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:45.120]   I have other friends on the right that say the sole goal is economic growth.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.120]   Nothing else matters.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.460]   I disagree with that as well.
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:52.880]   My view is the goal should be whatever enriches the civic quality of the United States of
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.880]   America.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:57.600]   And that includes those who know the language, know our ideals, pledge allegiance to those
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.680]   ideals, and also are willing to make economic contributions to the country, which is one
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.440]   of our ideals as well.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.000]   But whatever it is, we can have that debate.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   I have a very different view.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.480]   I don't think it's a proper role of immigration policy to make it a form of labor policy,
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.680]   because the United States of America is founded on excellence.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.060]   We should be able to compete.
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:15.600]   But that's a policy debate we can have.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.800]   But right now, we're not even able to have the policy debate because the whole immigration
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:24.200]   policy is built on not only a lie, but on rewarding those who do lie, and that's what
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.200]   I want to see change.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:32.880]   - Just to linger a little bit on the demonization and to bring Ann Coulter into the picture,
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:38.800]   which I recommend people should listen to your conversation with her.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:44.520]   I haven't listened to her much, but she had this thing where she clearly admires and respects
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:50.280]   you as a human being, and she's basically saying you're one of the good ones.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:56.240]   And this idea that you had this brilliant question of what does it mean to be an American.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:01.160]   And she basically said, "Not you, Vivek."
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:05.920]   But she said, "Well, maybe you, but not people like you."
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:12.640]   So that whole kind of approach to immigration, I think, is really anti-meritocratic, fundamental.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.840]   - And maybe even anti-American.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:15.840]   - Anti-American, yeah.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.360]   - So I want to confront this directly because it is a popular current on the American right.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.480]   The reason I'm not picking on Ann Coulter specifically is I think actually it's a much
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.760]   more widely shared view, and I just give her at least credit for willing to articulate
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:34.280]   it, a view that the blood and soil is what makes for your American identity, your genetic
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.280]   lineage.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.280]   And I just reject that view.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.280]   I think it's anti-American.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:44.020]   I think what makes for an American identity is your allegiance, your unabiding allegiance
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:48.200]   to the founding ideals of this country, and your willingness to pledge allegiance to those
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.480]   ideals.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.560]   So those are two different views.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:55.560]   I think that there is a view on the American right right now that says that we're not a
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.460]   creedal nation, that our nation is not about a creed.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:03.680]   It's about a physical place and a physical homeland.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:07.600]   I think that view fails on several accounts.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:11.240]   Obviously we're a nation, every nation has to have a geographic space that it defines
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.240]   as its own.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.680]   So obviously we are, among other things, a geographic space.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:19.920]   But the essence of the United States of America I think is the common creed, the ideals that
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.240]   hold that common nation together.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.100]   Without that, a few things happen.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:31.120]   First of all, American exceptionalism becomes impossible, and I'll tell you why.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.120]   Every other nation is also built on the same idea.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:39.080]   Most nations have been built on common blood and soil arguments, genetic stock of Italy
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:43.080]   or Japan would have a stronger national identity than the United States in that case, because
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:47.440]   they have a much longer standing claim on what their genetic lineage really was.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.240]   The ethnicity of the people is far more pure in those contexts than in the United States.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.480]   So that's the first reason, American exceptionalism becomes impossible.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:58.960]   The second is there's all kinds of contradictions that then start to emerge.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.320]   If your claim on American identity is defined based on how long you've been here, well then
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.920]   the Native Americans would have a far greater claim of being American than somebody who
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.280]   came here on the Mayflower or somebody who came here afterwards.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:17.360]   Now maybe that blood and soil view is, no, no, no, it's not quite the Native Americans,
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.040]   you only have to start at this point and end at this point.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:23.100]   So on this view of blood and soil identity, it has to be, okay, you couldn't have come
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.680]   before a certain year, then it doesn't count.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.800]   But if you came after a certain year, it doesn't count either.
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.720]   It just becomes highly uncompelling as a view of what American national identity actually
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:37.320]   is versus my view that American national identity is grounded on whether or not you pledge allegiance
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:43.560]   to the ideals codified in the Declaration of Independence and actualized in the US constitution.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.240]   And it's been said, some of my friends on the right have said things like, "People will
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:51.440]   not die for a set of ideals.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.440]   People won't fight for abstractions or abstract ideals."
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.520]   I actually disagree with that.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.680]   The American revolution basically disproves that.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:04.480]   The American revolution was fought for anything over abstract ideals that said that, you know
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:08.680]   what, we believe in self-governance and free speech and free exercise of religion.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.400]   That's what we believe in the United States, which was different from old world England.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.640]   So I do think that there is this brewing debate on the right.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.160]   And do I disagree like hell with Ann Coulter on this?
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.160]   Absolutely.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.720]   And did I take serious issue with some of the things she told me?
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.720]   Absolutely.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.480]   I believe that she had the stones to say, if I may say it that way, the things that
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:33.280]   many on the right believe, but haven't quite articulated in the way that she has.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.080]   And I think we need to have that debate in the open.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.920]   Now, personally, I think most of the conservative movement actually is with me on this, but
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.600]   I think it's become a very popular counter narrative in the other direction to say that,
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.720]   you know, your vision of American identity is tied, is far more physical in nature.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.920]   And to me, I think it is still ideals based in nature.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:54.980]   And I think that that's a good debate for the future for us to have in the conservative
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:55.980]   movement.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:00.560]   And I think it's going to be a defining feature of, you know, what direction the conservative
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.520]   movement goes in the future.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.520]   Quick pause.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.520]   Bathroom break.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:10.120]   Let me ask you to, again, steel man the case for and against Trump.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:16.960]   So my biggest criticism for him is the fake election scheme, the 2020 election, and actually
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:22.480]   the 2020 election in the way you formulated in the nation of victims, is just the entirety
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:29.200]   of that process instead of focusing on winning, doing a lot of whining.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:36.240]   I like people that win, not whine, even when the refs are biased in whatever direction.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.240]   So look, I think the United States of America, I preach this to the left, I preach it to
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240]   my kids.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.560]   We got to accept it on our own side too.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.200]   We're not going to save this country by being victims.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.320]   We're going to save this country by being victorious.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.320]   Okay.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.360]   And I don't care whether it's left-wing victimhood, right-wing victimhood.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.440]   I'm against victimhood culture.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:59.120]   The number one factor that determines whether you achieve something in life is you.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.260]   I believe that's not the only factor that matters.
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:03.440]   There's a lot of other factors that affect whether or not you succeed.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.200]   Life is not fair, but I tell my kids the same thing.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.360]   The number one factor that determines whether or not you succeed in achieving your goal
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   is you.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.040]   If I tell it to my kids and I preach it to the left, I'm going to preach that to our
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.040]   own side as well.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.440]   Now that being said, that's just a philosophy, okay?
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.160]   That's a personal philosophy.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.080]   You asked me to do something different and I'm always a fan.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.400]   One of the things, the standard I hope that people hold me to when they read this book
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:28.920]   as well as I try to do that in this book is to give the best possible argument for the
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.920]   other side.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:32.480]   You don't want to give some rinky-dink argument for the other side and knock it down.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:37.640]   You want to give the best possible argument for the other side and then offer your own
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.280]   view or else you don't understand your own.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.880]   So you asked me, what's the strongest case against Donald Trump?
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.200]   Well, I ran for US president against Donald Trump.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.280]   So I'm going to give you what my perspective is.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.160]   I think it's nothing of what you hear on MSNBC or from the left attacking him to be a threat
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160]   to democracy.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.720]   I think all of that's actually nonsense.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:03.320]   I actually think it is if you were making that case, you know, and I'm here's my full
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:07.880]   support as you know, but if you were making that case, I think for many voters who are
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:13.240]   of the next generation, they're asking a question about how are you going to understand the
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.680]   position that I'm in as a member of a new generation, the same criticism they had of
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.680]   Biden, they could say, oh, well, are you too old?
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.960]   Are you from a different generation that's too far removed from my generation's concerns?
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:28.720]   And I think that that's in many ways a factor that weighs on that was weighing on both Trump
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   and Biden.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:34.200]   But when they played the trick of swapping out Joe Biden, it left that issue much more
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.160]   on the table for Donald Trump.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.440]   So you're asking me to steel man it.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:41.360]   That's what I would say is that when I look at what's the number one issue that I would
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.980]   need to persuade independent voters of to say that, no, no, no, this is still the right
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:49.960]   choices, even though the other side claims to offer a new generation of leadership.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.520]   Here is somebody who is, you know, one of the older presidents we will have had who
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.520]   was elected.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.160]   How do we convince those people to vote for him?
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.560]   That's what I would give you in that category.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.560]   Right.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.040]   But I get it.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.520]   And you share a lot of ideas with Donald Trump.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.640]   So I get when you're running for president that you would say that kind of thing.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.840]   But there's, you know, there's other criticism you could provide.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.720]   And again, in the 2020 election, let me ask you, I mean, you spoke to Donald Trump recently.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.120]   What's your top objection to potentially voting for Donald Trump?
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.240]   And let me see if I can address that 2020 election and not in the.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.240]   What is it?
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.280]   It's a yes kind of objection.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:37.200]   It's just I don't think there's clear, definitive evidence that there was voter fraud.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]   Let me ask you about it.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.200]   Hold on a second.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:40.200]   Hold on a second.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.200]   Hold on a second.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.840]   I think there's a lot of interesting topics about the influence of media, of tech and
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.840]   so on.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.960]   But I want a president that has a good, clear relationship with the truth and knows what
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.640]   truth is, what is true and what is not true.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:03.800]   And moreover, I want a person who doesn't play victim, like you said, who focuses on
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.840]   winning and winning big.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:12.880]   And if they lose, like walk away with honor and win bigger next time, or like channel
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:18.120]   that into growth and winning, winning in some other direction.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:23.320]   So just like the strength of being able to give everything you got to win and walk away
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.000]   with honor if you lose.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.640]   And everything that happened around 2020 election, it just goes against that to me.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.000]   So I'll respond to that.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   Sure.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.240]   Obviously, I'm not the candidate, but I'm going to give you my perspective nonetheless.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.280]   I think we have seen some growth from Donald Trump over that first term in the experience
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280]   of the 2020 election.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.920]   And you hear a lot of that on the campaign trail.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.720]   I heard a lot of that even in the conversation that he had with you.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:55.240]   I think he is more ambitious for that second term than he was for that first term.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.680]   So I thought that was the most interesting part of what you just said is you're looking
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.120]   for somebody who has growth from their own experiences.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120]   Say what you will.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.880]   I have seen personally, I believe some meaningful level of personal growth and ambition for
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:14.080]   what Donald Trump hopes to achieve for the country in the second term that he wasn't
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.160]   able to, for one reason or another, you know, covid, you could put a lot of different things
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.160]   on it.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.160]   But in that first term.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.400]   Now, I think the facts of the backdrop of the 2020 election actually, like, really do
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:26.400]   matter.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:31.120]   I don't think you can isolate one particular aspect of criticizing the 2020 election without
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.240]   looking at it holistically.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:41.280]   On the eve of the 2020 presidential election, we saw a systematic, bureaucratically and
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.560]   government aided suppression of probably the single most important piece of information
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:51.520]   released on the eve of that election, the Hunter Biden laptop story revealing potentially
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.960]   a compromised U.S. presidential candidate.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:42:00.260]   His family was compromised by foreign interests and it was suppressed as misinformation by
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:02.080]   every major tech company.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.360]   The New York Post had its own Twitter account locked at that time.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:10.640]   And we now know that many of the censorship decisions made in the year 2020 were actually
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:16.520]   made at behest of U.S. bureaucratic actors in the deep state threatening those tech companies
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.040]   to do it or else those tech companies would face consequence.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.680]   I think it might be the most undemocratic thing that's happened in the history of our
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:29.440]   country, actually, is the way in which government actors who were never elected to the government
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:36.340]   used private sector actors to suppress information on the eve of an election that based on polling
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:41.560]   afterwards likely did influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.460]   That was election interference of the highest order.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:46.600]   So I think that that's just a hard fact that we have to contend with.
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:50.960]   And I think a lot of what you've heard in terms of complaints about the 2020 election,
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.640]   whatever those complaints have been, take place against the backdrop of large technology
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:00.200]   companies interfering in that election in a way that I think did have an impact on the
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.200]   outcome.
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.160]   I personally believe the Hunter Biden laptop story had not been suppressed and censored.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.040]   I think Donald Trump would have been unambiguous.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.560]   I think the president is right now would be Donald Trump, no doubt about it.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.820]   In my mind, if you look at polling before and after the impact that would have had on
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:16.080]   the independent voter.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.300]   Now you look at, OK, let's talk about constructive solutions, because I care about moving the
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:21.300]   country forward.
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:26.560]   What is a constructive solution to this issue of concerns about election integrity?
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:34.480]   Here's one single day voting on Election Day as a national holiday with paper ballots and
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.920]   government issued voter ID to match the voter file.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.640]   I favor that we do it even in Puerto Rico, which is a territory of the United States.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.240]   Why not do that everywhere in the United States?
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:45.240]   And I'll make a pledge.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.240]   I'll do it right here.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.240]   Right.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.680]   My pledge is.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:53.760]   As a leader in our movement, I will do.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.240]   Everything in my power to make sure we are done complaining about stolen elections.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:05.480]   If we get to that simple place of basic election security measures, I think it'd be unifying
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.840]   to make Election Day a national holiday that unites us around our civic purpose.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:13.400]   One day, single day voting on Election Day as a national holiday with paper ballots and
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.680]   government issued voter ID to match the voter file.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.260]   Let's get there as a country and you have my word.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:24.840]   I will lead our movement in whatever way I can to make sure we are done complaining about
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.280]   stolen elections and fake ballots.
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:33.280]   And I think that fact that you see resistance to that proposal, which is otherwise very
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.000]   practical, very reasonable, nonpartisan proposal.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.440]   I think the fact of that resistance actually provokes a lot of understandable skepticism,
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:51.120]   understandable skepticism of what else is actually going on, if not if not that, what
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.640]   exactly is going on here?
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:57.200]   Well, I think I agree with a lot of things you said.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:02.840]   Obviously disagree, but it's hard to disagree with a Hunter Biden laptop story, whether
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:05.280]   that would have changed the results of the election.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.280]   We can't know, obviously.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.520]   I looked at some post-election polling about the views that that would have had and I can't
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.920]   prove that to you, but that's my instinct.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:12.920]   It's my opinion.
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:20.920]   I think there's probably, that's just one example, maybe a sexy example of a bias in
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:26.600]   the complex of the media, and there's bias in the other direction too, but probably there's
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.960]   bias.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:28.960]   It's hard to characterize.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.040]   Let me ask you one question about because there's bias is one thing, bias in reporting.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.680]   Censorship is another.
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:40.080]   So I would, I would be open-minded to hearing an instance of, and if I did hear it, I would
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:51.240]   condemn it, of the government systematically ordering tech companies to suppress information
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:55.760]   that was favorable to Democrats, suppress that information to lift up Republicans.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.600]   If there was an instance that we know of government bureaucrats that were ordering technology
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:07.120]   companies covertly to silence information that voters otherwise would have had to advantage
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.080]   Republicans at the ballot box, to censor it, I would be against that.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:15.000]   And I will condemn that with equal force as I do to the suppression of the Hunter Biden
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.600]   laptop story, suppression and censorship of the origin of COVID-19.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.600]   All happened in 2020.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.680]   These are hard facts.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.840]   I'm not aware of one instance.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:27.840]   If you are aware of one, let me know, cause I would condemn it.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:33.840]   Most people in tech companies are privately, their political persuasion is on the left
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:39.640]   and most journalists, majority of journalists are on the left.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:46.160]   But to characterize the actual reporting and the impact of the reporting in the media and
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.080]   the impact of the censorship is difficult to do.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.440]   But that's a real problem, just like we talked about a real problem in immigration, but there's
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:55.440]   two different problems.
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.440]   I just want to sort them out.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.440]   Right.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.440]   Cause I have a problem with both.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:59.440]   You talked about two issues.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:01.320]   I think both are important, but they're different issues.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.080]   One is bias in reporting.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.200]   One is censorship of information.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.200]   So bias in reporting.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:13.480]   I felt certainly the recent presidential debate moderated by ABC was biased in the way that
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:21.560]   it was conducted, but that's a different issue from saying that voters don't get access to
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.760]   information through any source.
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.640]   So this Hunter Biden laptop story, we now know that it contains evidence of foreign
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:34.440]   interference in potentially the Biden administration, their families, incentive structure.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.840]   That story was systematically suppressed.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:41.120]   So in the United States of America, if you wanted to find that on the internet through
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:48.200]   any major social media platform or through even Google search, that story was suppressed
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:52.860]   or downplayed algorithmically, that you couldn't see it even on Twitter.
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:57.040]   If you tried to send it via direct message, that's the equivalent of email, right?
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.000]   Sending a peer to peer message.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.600]   They blocked you from even being able to send that story using private messages.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.880]   That I think is a different level of concern.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:08.320]   That's not bias at that point.
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.400]   That's outright interference in whether or not, you know, that's outright interference
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400]   in the election.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.120]   Let's do a thought experiment here.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.800]   Let's suppose that Russia orchestrated that.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.800]   What would the backlash be?
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.320]   Let's say the Russian government orchestrated the U.S. election was they interfered in it
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.960]   by saying that tech companies, they worked with them covertly to stop U.S. citizens from
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:32.600]   being able to see information on the eve of an election.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:37.320]   There would be a mass uproar in this country if the Russian government orchestrated that.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:42.480]   Well, if actors in the U.S. government bureaucracy or the U.S. technology industry bureaucracy
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.560]   orchestrated the same thing, then we can't apply a different standard to say that if
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:50.260]   Russia did it, it's really bad and interfered in our election.
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.840]   But if it happened right here in the United States of America, and by the way, they blame
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:57.240]   Russia for it falsely on the Russian disinformation of the Hunter Biden laptop story, that was
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.740]   false claim.
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:01.160]   We have to apply the same standard in both cases.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.640]   And so the fact that if that were Russian interference, it would have been an outcry,
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:07.200]   but now it happened domestically, and we just call that, hey, it's a little bit of bias
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:08.400]   ahead of an election.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.040]   I don't think that that's a fair characterization of how important that event was.
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.040]   Okay.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:19.720]   So the connection of government to platform is a real that should not exist.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:24.760]   Government FBI or anybody else should not be able to pressure platforms to censor information.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:25.760]   Yes.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:28.840]   We could talk about Paula Durov and the censorship there.
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.840]   There should not be any censorship and there's not should not be media bias.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.040]   And you're right to complain if there is media bias and we can lay it out in the open and
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:40.760]   try to fix that system.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:47.640]   That said, the voter fraud thing, you can't right a wrong by doing another wrong.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:52.120]   You can't just, if there's some shitty, shady stuff going on in the media and the censorship
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.880]   complex, you can't just make shit up.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:00.800]   You can't do the fake, fake elector scheme and then do a lot of shady, crappy behavior
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.600]   during January 6th and try to like shortcut your way just because your friend is cheating
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.160]   a monopoly when you're playing Monopoly.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.160]   You can't cheat.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160]   You shouldn't cheat yourself.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:19.240]   You should be honest and like with honor and use your platform to help fix the system versus
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.360]   like cheat your way.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:27.000]   So here's my view is, has any US politician ever been perfect throughout the course of
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000]   American history?
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000]   No.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.760]   But do you want to, if we want to understand the essence of what was going around in 2020,
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:38.080]   the mindset of the country, we had a year where people in this country were systematically
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:43.080]   locked down, told to shut up, sit down, do as they're told, unless they're BLM or Antifa
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.200]   rioters, in which case it's perfectly fine for them to burn cities down.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.760]   We were told that we're going to have an election, a free and fair election, and then they were
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.880]   denied information systematically heading into that election, which is really important.
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:57.960]   And in this case, damning information about one of the parties.
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:03.400]   And then you tell these people that they still have to continue to shut up and comply.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:08.680]   That creates, I think, a real culture of deep frustration in the United States of America.
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:13.680]   And I think that the reaction to systematic censorship is never good.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:14.680]   History teaches us that.
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:16.280]   It's not good in the United States.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.820]   It's not good at other points in the history of the United States.
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:24.260]   The reaction to systematic coordinated censorship and restraints on the freedom of a free people
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:25.600]   is never good.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.760]   And if you want to really understand what happened, one really wants to get to the bottom
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:33.080]   of it rather than, you know, figuring out who to point fingers at.
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:40.240]   That really was the essence of the national malaise at the end of 2020, is it was a year
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:47.600]   of unjust policies, including covid-19 lockdowns, systematic lies about it, lies about the election
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.520]   that created a level of public frustration that I think was understandable.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:59.780]   Now, the job of leaders is to how do you channel that in the most productive direction possible?
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:04.960]   And to your question, you know, to the independent voter out there evaluating, as you are, do
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:09.640]   I think that Donald Trump has exhibited a lot of growth based on his experience in his
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:11.960]   first term and what he hopes to achieve in a second term?
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.000]   I think the answer is absolutely yes.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.920]   And so even if you don't agree with everything that he's said or done in the choice ahead
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:24.160]   of us in this election, I still believe he's unambiguously the best choice to revive that
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:29.740]   sense of national pride and also prosperity in our country.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:33.960]   So people aren't in the condition where they're suffering at behest of government policies
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:37.880]   that leave them angry and channel that anger in other unproductive ways.
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:42.460]   No, the best way to do it is actually actions do speak louder than words, implement the
[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:44.720]   policies that make people's lives better.
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:47.440]   And I do think that that's the next step of how we best save the country.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:54.960]   Are you worried if in this election, it's a close election and Donald Trump loses by
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:53:02.000]   a whisker, that there's chaos that's unleashed and how do we minimize the chance of that?
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.400]   I mean, I don't think that that's a concern to frame narrowly in the context of Donald
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.860]   Trump winning it or losing it by a whisker.
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:18.460]   I think this is a man who in the last couple of months, in a span of two months, has faced
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.460]   two assassination attempts.
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:24.900]   And we're not talking about theoretical attempts, we're talking about like gunshots fired.
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:28.220]   That is history changing in the context of American history.
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:30.460]   We haven't seen that in a generation.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:32.800]   And yet now that has become normalized in the US.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:35.580]   So do I worry we're skating on thin ice as a country?
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:36.580]   I do.
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:44.520]   I do think it is a little bit strange to obsess over our concerns or national or media concerns
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:51.580]   over Donald Trump, when in fact, he's the one on the receiving end of fire from assailants
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:56.580]   who reportedly are saying exactly the kinds of things about him that you hear from the
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:58.660]   Democratic machine.
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:05.180]   And I do think that it is irresponsible, at least for the Democratic Party to make their
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:06.700]   core case against Donald Trump.
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:11.140]   It was Joe Biden's entire message for years that he's a threat to democracy and to the
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:12.380]   existence of America.
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:16.620]   Well, if you keep saying that about somebody against the backdrop conditions that we live
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:19.820]   in as a country, I don't think that's good for a nation.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:23.020]   And so do I have concerns about the future of the country?
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:25.020]   Do I think we're skating on thin ice?
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:26.020]   Absolutely.
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:30.980]   And I think the best way around it is really through it, through it in this election win
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.980]   by a landslide.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:36.180]   I think a unifying landslide could be the best thing that happens for this country,
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:40.460]   like Reagan delivered in 1980 and then again in 1984.
[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:43.620]   And in a very practical note, a landslide minus some shenanigans is still going to be
[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:44.980]   a victory.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.620]   That I think is how we unite this country.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:54.460]   And so I don't think, you know, 50.001 margin where cable news is declaring the winner six
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:57.140]   days after the election, I don't think that's going to be good for the country.
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:02.820]   I think a decisive victory that unites the country, turns the page on a lot of the challenges
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:05.700]   of the last four years and says, OK, this is where we're going.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.820]   This is who we are and what we stand for.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:12.500]   This is a revival of our national identity and revive national pride in the United States,
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:14.720]   regardless of whether you're a Democrat or Republican.
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.500]   That I think is achievable in this election, too.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.780]   And that's what the outcome I'm rooting for.
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:27.380]   So just to pile on, since we're steelmanning the criticism against Trump is the rhetoric.
[01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:34.640]   I wish there was less of, although at times it is so ridiculous, it is entertaining.
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:41.380]   The I hate Taylor Swift type of tweets or truths or whatever, I.
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:42.960]   I don't think that he's a funny guy.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.300]   I mean, the reality is different people have different attributes.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:51.420]   One of the attributes for Donald Trump is he's one of the funnier presidents we've had
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:52.420]   in a long time.
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.420]   That might not be everybody's cup of tea.
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:54.420]   Maybe it's different.
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:57.000]   People don't want that's not a quality they value in their president.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.400]   I think at a moment where you're also able to make it, I will say this much is everybody's
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:03.400]   got different styles.
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.860]   Donald Trump's style is different from mine.
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:11.620]   But I do think that if we're able to use levity in a moment of national division in some ways,
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:15.580]   I think right now is probably a role where really good standup comedians could probably
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:19.860]   do a big service to the country if they're able to laugh at everybody 360 degrees.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:23.540]   So they can go up there and make fun of Donald Trump all they want, do it in a lighthearted
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:25.460]   and manner that loves the country.
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.020]   Do the same thing to Kamala Harris and with an equal standard.
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:30.300]   I think that's actually good for the country.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:33.980]   But you know, I think I'm I'm more interested, Lex, as you know, in discussing the future
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:35.200]   direction of the country.
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:36.200]   My own views.
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.700]   I was a presidential candidate who ran against Donald Trump, by the way, and is supporting
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:40.700]   him now.
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:47.220]   But I I just prefer engaging on the substance of what I think each candidate is going to
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:51.380]   achieve for the country rather than picking on really the personal attributes of either
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:52.380]   one.
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.380]   Right.
[01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:56.020]   I'm not criticizing Kamala Harris's manner of laugh or whatever, you know, one might
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:57:00.180]   criticize as like a personal attribute of hers that you may hear elsewhere.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:05.980]   And I just think our country is better off if we have a focus on both the policies, but
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:08.400]   also who's going to be more likely to revive the country.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.720]   That I think is a healthy debate headed to an election.
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.180]   I think everybody has their personality attributes, their flaws, what makes them funny and lovable
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:18.640]   to some people makes them irritating to others.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.300]   I think that that matters less heading into an election.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.080]   I love that you do that.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:28.140]   I love the focus on policy and can speak for hours on policy.
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:29.720]   Let's look at foreign policy.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:30.720]   Sure.
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:37.160]   What kind of peace deal do you think is possible, feasible, optimal in Ukraine?
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.160]   If you sat down, you became president.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:45.520]   If you sat down with Zelensky and sat down with Putin, what do you think is possible
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:46.840]   to talk to them about?
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:52.800]   One of the hilarious things you did, which were intense and entertaining, your debates
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.920]   in the primary, but anyway, is how you grilled the other candidates that didn't know any
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:57:59.920]   regions.
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:07.080]   They wanted to send money and troops and lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.800]   people and they didn't know any of the regions in Ukraine.
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.480]   You had a lot of zingers in that one, but anyway, how do you think about negotiating
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.520]   with world leaders about what's going on there?
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:23.000]   So look, I think that let's just get the self-interest of each party on the table and to be very
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.360]   transparent about it.
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:29.040]   From everyone's perspective, they think the other side is the aggressor or whatever.
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.640]   Just get it on the table.
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:39.480]   Russia is concerned about NATO shifting the balance of power away from Russia to Western
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:43.400]   Europe when NATO has expanded far more than they expected to.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:47.720]   And frankly, that Russia was told that NATO was going to expand, it's an uncomfortable
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:52.160]   fact for some in America, but James Baker made a commitment to Mikhail Gorbachev in
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:55.560]   the early '90s where he said NATO would expand not one inch past East Germany.
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:59.360]   Well, NATO's expanded far more after the fall of the USSR than it did during the existence
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:03.800]   of the USSR, and that is a reality we have to contend with.
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:05.780]   That's the Russian perspective.
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:09.840]   From the Western perspective, the hard fact is Russia was the aggressor in this conflict
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:15.920]   crossing the boundaries of a sovereign nation, and that is a violation of international norms,
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:19.280]   and it's a violation of the recognition of international law of nations without borders
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.280]   are not a nation.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.420]   And so against that backdrop, what's the actual interest of each country here?
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:30.880]   I think if we're able to do a reasonable deal that gives Russia the assurances it needs
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:37.020]   about what they might allege is NATO expansionism violating prior commitments, but get codified
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:41.180]   commitments for Russia that we're not going to see willy-nilly behavior of just randomly
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:45.580]   deciding they're going to violate the sovereignty of neighboring nations and have hard assurances
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:49.100]   and consequences for that, that's the beginnings of a deal.
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:51.800]   But then I want to be ambitious for the United States.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:56.800]   I want to weaken the Russia-China alliance, and I think that we can do a deal that requires,
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:04.680]   that gives some real gives to Russia conditioned on Russia withdrawing itself from its military
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:06.780]   alliance with China.
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:09.900]   And this could be good for Russia too in the long run, because right now Vladimir Putin
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:13.860]   does not enjoy being Xi Jinping's little brother in that relationship.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:19.400]   But Russia's military combined with China's naval capacity and Russia's hypersonic missiles
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.860]   and China's economic might, together those countries in an alliance pose a real threat
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:25.380]   to the United States.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:30.500]   But if as a condition for a reasonable discussion about where different territories land, given
[02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:36.020]   what's occupied right now, hard requirements that Russia remove its military presence from
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:38.620]   the Western hemisphere, people forget this.
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:42.860]   Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, we don't want a Russian military presence in the Western
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:43.860]   hemisphere.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.540]   That too would be a win for the United States.
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:50.160]   No more joint military exercises with China off the coast of the Aleutian Islands.
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:54.160]   The kinds of wins that the United States wants to protect the West's security, get Russia
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:58.400]   out of the Western hemisphere, certainly out of the North American periphery, and then
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:02.880]   also make sure that Russia's no longer in that military alliance with China.
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.640]   In return for that, able to provide Russia some things that are important to Russia,
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.680]   we'd have to have a reasonable discussion about what the territorial concessions would
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.460]   be at the end of this war to bring it to peace and resolution, and what the guarantees are
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:18.080]   to make sure that NATO is going to not expand beyond the scope of what the United States
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:20.880]   has at least historically guaranteed.
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:26.520]   That I think together would be a reasonable deal that gives every party what they're looking
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:30.960]   for that results in immediate peace, that results in greater stability.
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.160]   And most importantly, weakening the Russia China alliance, which I think is the actual
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:40.240]   threat that we have so far, no matter who in this debate of more or less Ukraine funding
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:42.880]   has really failed to confront.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.020]   That I think is the way we deescalate the risk of World War III, and weaken the threats
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:50.860]   to the West by actually dismantling that alliance.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:56.900]   So from an American perspective, the main interest is weakening the alliance between
[02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:57.900]   Russia and China.
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:01:58.900]   Yes.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.460]   I think the military alliance between Russia and China represents the single greatest threat
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:03.460]   we face.
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:08.020]   So do a deal that's very reasonable across the board.
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:12.580]   But one of the main things we get out of it is weakening that alliance so no joint military
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:16.260]   exercises, no military collaborations, these are monitorable.
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:17.460]   These are monitorable attributes.
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:21.340]   If there's cheating on that, we're going to immediately have consequences as a consequence
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:22.980]   of their cheating.
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:26.920]   But we can't cheat on our own obligations that we would make in the context of that
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.920]   deal as well.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:32.300]   There might be some extremely painful things for Ukraine here.
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:37.340]   So Ukraine currently captured a small region in Russia, the Kursk region, but Russia has
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:42.940]   captured giant chunks, Donetsk, Luhansk, Siberian, Kherson regions.
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:47.620]   So it seems given what you're laying out, it's very unlikely for Russia to give up any
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:49.180]   of the regions that's already captured.
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:53.540]   I actually think that that would come down to the specifics of the negotiation.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:57.280]   But the core goals of the negotiation are peace in this war, weaken the Russia-China
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.280]   alliance.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.620]   And for Russia, what did they get out of it?
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:03.420]   Part of this is here's something that's not negative for Ukraine, but that could be positive
[02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:05.220]   for Russia as part of that deal, right?
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:09.340]   Because it's not a zero-sum game alone with Ukraine on the losing end of this.
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:14.100]   I think reopening economic relations with the West would be a big win for Russia, but
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:18.500]   also a carrot that gets them out of that military relationship with China.
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:24.620]   So I do think that the foreign policy establishment has historically been at the very least unimaginative
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:26.700]   about the levers that we're able to use.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:31.980]   Actually, I was a little bit critical of Nixon earlier in this discussion for his contribution
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:35.340]   to the overgrowth of the US entitlement state and regulatory state.
[02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:39.180]   But I'll give Nixon credit here on a different point, which is that he was imaginative of
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:44.940]   being able to pull red China out from the clasp of the USSR.
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:48.820]   He broke the China-Russia alliance back then, which was an important step to bring us to
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:50.020]   the near end of the Cold War.
[02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:55.260]   So I think there's an opportunity for a similar unconventional maneuver now of using greater
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:04:00.500]   reopened economic relations with Russia to pull Russia out from the hands of China today.
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:03.900]   There's no skin off Ukraine's back for that, and I do think that's a big carrot for Russia
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:05.100]   in this direction.
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:10.580]   I do think that will involve some level of territorial negotiation as well, that out
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:14.300]   of any good deal, not everyone's going to like 100% of what comes out of it.
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:17.820]   But that's part of the cost of securing peace, is that not everyone's going to be happy about
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:18.820]   every attribute.
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:23.740]   But I could make a case that an immediate peace deal is also now in the best interests
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:24.740]   of Ukraine.
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:26.780]   Let's just rewind the clock.
[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:31.660]   We're looking at now, let's just say we're early 2022, maybe June of 2022.
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:37.280]   Zelensky was ready to come to the table for a deal back then, until Boris Johnson traveled
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.020]   when he had his own domestic political travails to convince Zelensky to continue to fight.
[02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:45.300]   And that goes to the point where when nations aren't asked to pay for their own national
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:50.660]   security, they have what the problem is of moral hazard of taking risks that really are
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:54.500]   suboptimal risks for them to take, because they're not bearing the consequences of taking
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:57.680]   those risks, not fully in the cost.
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:03.020]   If Ukraine had done a deal back then, I think it is unambiguous that they would have done
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:08.940]   a better deal for themselves than they're doing now after having spent hundreds of billions
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:14.580]   of dollars and expended tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:19.160]   So the idea that Ukraine is somehow better off because it failed to do that deal before
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:20.420]   is a lie.
[02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:23.620]   And if we're not willing to learn from those mistakes of the recent past, we're doomed
[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:25.480]   to repeat them again.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:30.020]   So this idea that it would be painful for Ukraine, you know, it's been painful.
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:34.880]   Tens and tens and tens of thousands of people continuing to die without any increased leverage
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:36.900]   in actually getting the outcome that they want.
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:41.180]   So I think there's an opportunity for a win-win-win, a win for the United States and the West more
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:46.420]   broadly in weakening the Russia-China alliance, a win for Ukraine in having an agreement that
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:51.180]   is backstopped by the United States of America's interests that provides a greater degree of
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:56.020]   long run security to the future existence of Ukraine and its sovereignty and also stopping
[02:05:56.020 --> 02:05:57.620]   the bloodshed today.
[02:05:57.620 --> 02:06:01.840]   And I think a win for Russia, which is to reopen economic relations with the West and
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:07.700]   have certain guarantees about what the mission creep or scope creep of NATO will be.
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:12.860]   There's no rule that says that when one party before before a full outright world war starts,
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:17.020]   at least there's an opportunity for there to actually be a win for everybody on the
[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:22.140]   table rather than to assume that a win for us is a loss to Russia or that anything positive
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:25.500]   that happens for Russia is a loss for the United States or Ukraine.
[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:29.060]   Just to add to the table, some things that Putin won't like, but I think are possible
[02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:36.700]   to negotiate, which is Ukraine joining the European Union and not NATO.
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:43.700]   So establishing some kind of economic relationships there and also splitting the bill, sort of
[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:48.580]   guaranteeing some amount of money from both Russia and the United States for rebuilding
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:57.400]   Ukraine is one of the challenges in Ukraine, a war torn country, is how do you guarantee
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.340]   the flourishing of this particular nation?
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:00.340]   Right.
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:06.820]   So you want to not just stop the death of people and the destruction, but also provide
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:11.460]   a foundation on which you can rebuild the country and build a flourishing future country.
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.620]   I think out of this conversation alone.
[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:20.220]   There are a number of levers on the table for negotiation in a lot of different directions.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:21.220]   And that's where you want to be.
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:22.220]   Right.
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:26.100]   If there's only one factor that matters to each of the two parties and those are their
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:29.780]   red line factors, then there's no room for negotiation.
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:39.700]   This is a this is a deeply complicated, historically intricate dynamic between Ukraine and Russia
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:46.740]   and between NATO and the United States and the Russia, China alliance and economic interests
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:49.740]   that are at issue combined with the geopolitical factors.
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:53.460]   There are a lot of levers for negotiation and the more levers there are, the more likely
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:56.700]   there is to be a win, win, win deal that gets done for everybody.
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:08:00.120]   So I think it should be encouraging the fact that there are as many different possible
[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:06.840]   levers here almost make certain that a reasonable, practicable peace deal is possible.
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.760]   In contrast to a situation where there's only one thing that matters for each side, then
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:11.840]   I can't tell you that there's a deal to be done.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:13.560]   There's definitely a deal to be done here.
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:17.160]   And I think that it requires real leadership in the United States playing hardball, not
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:21.720]   just with one side of this, not just with Zelensky or with Putin, but across the board,
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:25.720]   hardball for our own interests, which are the interests of stability here.
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:30.040]   And I think that that will happen to well serve both Ukraine and Russia in the process.
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:31.800]   If you were president, would you call Putin?
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:32.800]   Absolutely.
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:35.520]   I mean, in any negotiation, you got to manage when you're calling somebody and when you're
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:36.520]   not.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:40.560]   But I do believe that open conversation and the willingness to have that as another lever
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.840]   in the negotiation is totally fair game.
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:43.840]   Okay.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:47.440]   Let's go to the China side of this.
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:55.800]   The big concern here is that the brewing, colder, God forbid, hot war between the United
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:58.100]   States and China in the 21st century.
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:59.100]   How do we avoid that?
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:00.580]   So a few things.
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:07.980]   One is, I do think the best way we also avoid it is by reducing the consequences to the
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:11.940]   United States in the event of that type of conflict.
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:15.820]   Because at that point, what you're setting up for, if the consequences are existential
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:19.980]   for the United States, then what you're buying yourself in the context of what could be a
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:22.740]   small conflict is an all out great war.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:26.760]   So the first thing I want to make sure we avoid is a major conflict between the United
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.420]   States and China, like a world war level conflict.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:33.780]   And the way to do that is to bring down the existential stakes for the U.S. and the way
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:38.340]   we bring down the existential stakes for the U.S. is make sure that the United States does
[02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:41.980]   not depend on China for our modern way of life.
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:42.980]   Right now we do.
[02:09:42.980 --> 02:09:43.980]   Okay.
[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:47.340]   So right now we depend on China for everything from the pharmaceuticals in our medicine cabinet,
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:51.540]   95 percent of ibuprofen, one of the most basic medicines used in the United States, depends
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:53.660]   on China for its supply chain.
[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:59.020]   We depend on China, ironically, for our own military industrial base.
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:02.020]   Think about how little sense that makes actually.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:07.260]   Our own military, which supposedly exists to protect ourselves against adversaries,
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:11.540]   depends for its own supplies, semiconductors and otherwise, on our top adversary.
[02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:12.900]   That doesn't make sense.
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:16.860]   Even if you're a libertarian in the school of Friedrich Von Hayek, somebody I admire
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:23.380]   as well, even then you would not argue for a foreign dependence on adversary for your
[02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:24.380]   military.
[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:28.060]   So I think that's the next step we need to take is at least reduce U.S. dependence on
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:34.740]   China for the most essential inputs for the functioning of the United States of America,
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:35.740]   including our own military.
[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:41.380]   As a side note, I believe that means not just onshoring to the United States, it does.
[02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:44.820]   But if we're really serious about that, it also means expanding our relationships with
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:48.820]   allies like Japan, South Korea, India, the Philippines.
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:52.420]   And that's an interesting debate to have because some on the right would say, okay, I want
[02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:55.720]   to decouple from China, but I also want less trade with all these other places.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:57.260]   You can't have both those things at the same time.
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:10:58.260]   You can have one or the other.
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:59.460]   You can't have both.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:02.740]   And so we have to acknowledge and be honest with ourselves that there are tradeoffs to
[02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:04.780]   declaring independence from China.
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:06.820]   But the question is, what are the long run benefits?
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:11.380]   Now, you think about the other way to do this is strategic clarity.
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:18.940]   I think the way that you see world wars often emerge is strategic ambiguity from two adversaries
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:22.680]   who don't really know what the other side's red line is or isn't and accidentally crosses
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:23.680]   those red lines.
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:28.240]   And so I think we need to be much clearer with what are our hard red lines and what
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:29.240]   aren't they.
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.080]   And I think that's the single most effective way to make sure this doesn't spiral into
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.080]   major world war.
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:38.160]   And then let's talk about ending the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the terms that I just discussed
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:39.280]   with you before.
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:43.400]   I think weakening the Russia-China alliance not only reduces the risk that Russia becomes
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.840]   an aggressor, it also reduces the risk that China takes the risks that could escalate
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.080]   us to World War III as well.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:53.880]   So I think that geopolitically, you got to look at these things holistically.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.320]   That end of the Russia-Ukraine war and that peace deal deescalates not only the Russia-Ukraine
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:03.600]   conflict, but the risk of a broader conflict that includes China as well by also weakening
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:07.600]   China because Russia also has hypersonic missiles and missile capabilities that are ahead of
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:08.760]   that of China's.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:11.840]   If Russia's no longer in a military alliance with China, that changes China's calculus
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:13.120]   as well.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:19.640]   So that's kind of, I think, more strategic vision we need in our foreign policy than
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:23.720]   we've had since certainly, you know, the Nixon era.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:28.080]   I think that you need people who are going to be able to challenge the status quo, question
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:32.880]   the existing orthodoxies, the willingness to use levers to get great deals done that
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:35.440]   otherwise wouldn't have gotten done.
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:36.800]   And that's what I do think.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.280]   Someone like Donald Trump in the presidency, and obviously I ran for president as an outsider
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:41.960]   and a businessman as well.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.160]   I think this is an area, our foreign policy is one where we actually benefit from having
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:51.840]   business leaders in those roles rather than people who are shackled by the traditional
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:53.560]   political manner of thinking.
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:58.320]   I think the thing you didn't quite make clear, but I think implied, is that we have to accept
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:02.840]   the red line that China provides of the one-China policy.
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.560]   Both sides need to have their red lines.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:05.680]   Both sides need to have their red lines.
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:09.840]   So, you know, we can get into specifics, but it's going to vary depending on the circumstances.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:14.640]   But the principle that I would give you is that we have to have a hard red line that's
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:15.640]   clear.
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:18.280]   And I think that that hard red line, I was clear during my campaign on this, I'll say
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:22.240]   it again, is I think that we have to have a clear red line that China will not and should
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:26.280]   not for any time in the foreseeable future annex Taiwan.
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:31.680]   I do think that for the United States, it probably is prudent right now not to suddenly
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:38.400]   upend the diplomatic policy we've adopted for decades of what is recognizing the one-China
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:42.120]   policy and our position of quiet deference to that.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.800]   And understand that that may be their red line, is the national recognition of Taiwan
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.640]   as an independent nation would be a red line that China would have, but we would have a
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:56.680]   red line to say that we do not in any circumstance tolerate the annexation by physical force
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:59.560]   in any time in the foreseeable future when that's against the interests of the United
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:00.560]   States of America.
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:02.120]   So, those are examples.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:06.000]   But the principle here is you asked how do we avoid major conflict with China?
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.400]   I think it starts with clear red lines on both sides.
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:12.400]   I think it starts with also lowering the stakes for the United States by making sure we're
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:15.280]   not dependent on China for our modern way of life.
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.400]   And I think it also starts with, ironically, using a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:24.280]   war as a way of weakening the Russia-China alliance, which in the other direction of
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:27.200]   weakening China has significant benefits to us as well.
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:34.520]   But what do you do when China says very politely, "We're going to annex Taiwan whether you like
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.520]   it or not"?
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:38.520]   Against the backdrop that I just laid out, that's not going to happen.
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.060]   That wouldn't happen if we actually make sure that we are crystal clear about what our red
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.400]   lines and priorities are.
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:47.520]   We're also dependent on Taiwan right now for our own semiconductor supply chain.
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:52.000]   So, China knows that's going to draw us into serious conflict in that circumstance.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.280]   So, against the backdrop of clearly drawn red lines, against the backdrop of Russia
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:59.880]   no longer automatically being in China's camp, that's a big lever.
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.720]   I think also strengthening our relationship with other allies where we have room to strengthen
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.720]   those relationships like India.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:09.440]   And I'm not just saying that because my name is Vivek Ramaswamy, right?
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:13.400]   I'm saying it because it's strategically important to the United States to understand that, God
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:17.000]   forbid, in a conflict scenario, China would perceive some risk to the Indian Ocean or
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.840]   the Andaman Sea, no longer being reliable for getting Middle Eastern oil supplies.
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:23.180]   There's a lot of levers here.
[02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:28.000]   But I think that if we are both strategically clear with our allies and with our adversaries
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.200]   about what our red lines are, what our priorities are, reasonable deals that pull Russia out
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:36.520]   of the hands of China and vice versa, reasonable allies and relationships that cause China
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:40.080]   to question whether it can continue to have the same access to Middle Eastern oil supplies
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:44.920]   as it does today, and then clear red lines with China itself about what we definitely
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.240]   aren't okay with and understand that they may have certain red lines too.
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:54.600]   That allows us, I think, to still avoid what many people will call the unavoidable conflict,
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:59.360]   the Thucydides trap against the circumstance of when there's a rising power against the
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:04.040]   backdrop of a declining power, conflict always becomes inevitable.
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:05.040]   That's a theory.
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:06.040]   It's not a law of physics.
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:09.760]   And I don't think that, A, we have to be a declining power, and B, I don't think that
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:13.480]   that has to necessarily result in major conflict with China here.
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:17.400]   It's going to require real leadership, leadership with a spine.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:21.960]   And you don't have to judge based on international relations theory to form your view on this.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:25.880]   Four years under Trump, we didn't have major conflicts in the Middle East, in places like
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:31.560]   Russia, Ukraine, we were on the cusp of war with North Korea when Obama left office and
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:33.240]   Trump took over.
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:36.400]   Four years under Biden, less than four years under Biden and Harris, what do you have?
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:40.800]   Major conflicts in the Middle East, major conflict in Russia, Ukraine, judged by the
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:41.800]   results.
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.260]   And, you know, I mean, I would say that even if you're somebody who disagrees with a lot
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:48.960]   of Donald Trump and you don't like his style, if your single issue is you want to stay out
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.240]   of World War III, I think there's a pretty clear case for why you go for Trump in this
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:55.520]   election.
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:00.280]   So Prime Minister Modi, I think you've complimented him in a bunch of different directions, one
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.360]   of which is when you're discussing nationalism.
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:03.360]   Yeah.
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:08.240]   I think I believe that, you know, somebody I've gotten to know actually reasonably well,
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:11.320]   for example, recently is Giorgia Maloney, who is a leader of Italy, told her the same
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:12.320]   thing.
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:17.760]   One of the things I love about her as a leader of Italy is that she does not apologize for
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:23.080]   the national identity of the country and that she stands for certain values uncompromisingly.
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:26.440]   And she doesn't give a second care about what the media has to say about it.
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.120]   One of things I love last time I spoke to her when she was in the U.S. when we sat down
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:32.600]   was she talked about she doesn't even read the newspaper.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:36.120]   She doesn't read and watch the media and allows her to make decisions that are best for the
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:37.120]   people.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:41.460]   And there are elements of that in Modi's approach as well, which I respect about him is he doesn't
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:46.000]   apologize for the fact that India has a national identity and that the nation should be proud
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.000]   of it.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.000]   But I'm not saying that because I'm proud of Maloney or Modi for their own countries.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.120]   I'm American.
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.880]   I think there are lessons to learn from leaders who are proud of their own nation's identity
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:58.880]   rather than apologizing for it.
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.200]   And I think it's a big part of, you know, it's why I ran for president on a campaign
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.360]   centered on national pride.
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:08.840]   It's also why I'm not only voting for, but actively supporting Donald Trump, because
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:12.280]   I do think he is going to be the one that restores that missing national pride in the
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:13.280]   United States.
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:16.840]   And, you know, I touch on this as well in the in the book.
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:17.880]   There's a chapter here.
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:20.720]   It says nationalism isn't a bad word.
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:26.120]   I think nationalism can be a very positive thing if it's grounded in the actual true
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:27.520]   attributes of a nation.
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:31.800]   And in the United States, that doesn't mean ethno nationalism, because that was not what
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:35.720]   the national identity of the United States was based on in the first place.
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:41.240]   But a civic nationalism grounded in our actual national ideals, that is who we are.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:46.000]   And I think that that is something that we've gotten uncomfortable with in the countries
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.120]   to say that, oh, I'm proud of being American and I believe in American exceptionalism.
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:50.480]   How that's looking down on others.
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:54.000]   No, not looking down on anybody, but I'm proud of my own country.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.160]   And I think Modi's revived that spirit in India in a way that was missing for a long
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:58.160]   time.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:59.160]   Right.
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:01.720]   India had an inferiority complex, a psychological inferiority complex.
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:06.840]   But now to be proud of its national heritage and its national myth making and its national
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:11.440]   legacy and history and to say that, you know, every nation does have to have a kind of myth
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:15.280]   making about its past and to be proud of that.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:20.480]   It's like Malcolm X actually said this here in the United States, he said, a nation without
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:27.040]   an appreciation for its history is like a tree without roots.
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:29.440]   It's dead.
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:31.960]   And I think that that's true, not just for the United States, I think it's true for every
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:32.960]   other nation.
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:38.320]   I think leaders like Maloney in Italy, leaders like Modi in India have done a great job that
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:42.640]   I wish to bring that type of pride back in the United States.
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:47.880]   And whatever I do next, Lex, I'll tell you, this is I think reviving that sense of identity
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:52.240]   and pride, especially in the next generation, is one of the most important things we can
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:54.280]   do for this country.
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:59.240]   Speaking of what you do next, any chance you run in 2028?
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.120]   Well, I'm not going to rule it out.
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:02.760]   I mean, that's a long time from now.
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:07.160]   And I'm most focused on what I can do in the next chapter for the country.
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:08.560]   I ran for president.
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:12.600]   Million things that I learned from that experience that you can only learn by doing it.
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:16.560]   It was very much a, you know, fire first, aim later.
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:19.240]   When getting into the race, there was no way I could have planned and plotted this out
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:21.400]   as somebody who was coming from the outside.
[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:24.920]   I was 37 years old, came from the business world.
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:28.200]   So there was a lot that only could learn by actually doing it.
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:30.200]   And I did.
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:33.600]   But I care about the same things that led me into the presidential race.
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:35.600]   And I don't think the issues have been solved.
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:39.920]   I think that we have a generation that is lost in the country.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:41.080]   It's not just young people.
[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:46.960]   I think it's all of us, in some ways, are hungry for purpose and meaning at a time in
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:52.960]   our history when the things that used to fill that void in our heart, they're missing.
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:56.960]   And I think we need a president who both has the right policies for the country, you know,
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:01.640]   seal the border, grow the economy, stay out of World War III, end rampant crime.
[02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:04.920]   Yes, we need the right policies.
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:10.140]   But we also need leaders who, in a sustained way, revive our national character, revive
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:15.240]   our sense of pride in this country, revive our identity as Americans.
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:20.520]   And you know, I think that that need exists as much today as it did when I first ran for
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:21.520]   president.
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:23.600]   I don't think it's going to be automatically solved in just a few years.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:27.600]   I think Donald Trump is the right person to carry that banner forward for the next four
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:28.740]   years.
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:31.960]   But after that, we'll see where the country is headed into 2028.
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:37.600]   And whatever I do, it'll be whatever has a maximal positive impact on the country.
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:42.660]   I'll also tell you that my laser focus, maybe as distinct from other politicians on both
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:48.280]   sides, is to take America to the next level to move beyond our victimhood culture to restore
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:50.360]   our culture of excellence.
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:55.120]   We got to shut down that nanny state, the entitlement state, the regulatory state, the
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:22:00.080]   foreign policy nanny state, shut it down and revive who we really are as Americans.
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:02.660]   And I'm as passionate about that as ever.
[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:05.100]   But the next step is not running for president.
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:09.340]   The next step is what happens in the next next four years.
[02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:13.440]   And that's why over the next four weeks, I'm focused on doing whatever I can to make sure
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:14.580]   we succeed in this election.
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:22.380]   Well, I hope you run because this was made clear on the stage in the primary debates.
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:28.960]   You have a unique clarity and honesty in expressing the ideas you stand for.
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:32.040]   And it would be nice to see that.
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:36.240]   I would also like to see the same thing on the other side, which would make for some
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.480]   bad ass interesting debates.
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:45.600]   I would love nothing more than a kick ass set of top tier Democrat candidates.
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:49.920]   After four years of Donald Trump, we have a primary filled with actually people who
[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:53.280]   have real visions for the country on both sides.
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:59.200]   And the people of this country can choose between those competing visions without insult
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:00.480]   or injury being the way we.
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:03.320]   I would love nothing more than to see that in 2028.
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:04.320]   Who do you think?
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:09.640]   So for me, I would love to see in some kind of future where it's you versus somebody like
[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:10.640]   Tim Walz.
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:18.240]   So to Tim Walz, maybe I'm lacking in knowledge as a first of all, like a good dude has similar
[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:27.600]   to you, strongly held, if not radical ideas of how to make progress in this country.
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:33.580]   So to just be on stage and debate honestly about the ideas, there are like very, there's
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:36.400]   a tension between those ideas.
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:37.400]   Is there other people?
[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:38.840]   Shapiro is interesting also.
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:48.920]   I would like to take on in an earnest, in civil, but contested context, right, of a
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:49.920]   debate.
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:50.920]   Who do you want to take on?
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:53.720]   You want to take on somebody who disagrees with you, but still has deep ideology of their
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:54.720]   own.
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:56.440]   I think John Fetterman's pretty interesting, right?
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:01.040]   He's demonstrated himself to be somebody who is thoughtful, able to change his mind on
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:05.960]   positions, but not in some sort of fake flip-floppity, flippity-floppity way, but in a thoughtful
[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:06.960]   evolution.
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:10.040]   Somebody who's been through personal struggles, somebody I deeply disagree with on a lot of
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:14.800]   his, on a lot of his views, most of his views, but who I can at least say comes across at
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:20.040]   least as somebody who has been through that torturous process of really examining your
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:25.800]   beliefs and convictions and has, when necessary, been able to preach to his own tribe where
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:26.800]   he thinks they're wrong.
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:27.800]   I think it's interesting.
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:32.880]   I think that you have, you know, a number of other leaders probably emerging at lower
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:33.880]   levels.
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:36.520]   On the left, not everybody's going to necessarily come from Washington, D.C.
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:40.960]   In fact, the longer they're there, the more they, in some ways, get polluted by it.
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:44.280]   Yeah, I think the governor of Colorado, he's an interesting guy.
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.320]   He's got a more libertarian tendency.
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:52.040]   You know, I don't know as much about his views from a national perspective, but it's intriguing
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:57.480]   to see somebody who has at least libertarian, freedom-oriented tendencies within the Democratic
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:58.480]   Party.
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:02.440]   I think that there are a number of, you know, I mean, I don't, you know, foresee him running
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:06.320]   for president, but I had a debate last year when I was running for president with Ro Khanna,
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:10.680]   who, say what you will about him, he's a highly intelligent person and is somebody who is
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:13.960]   at least willing to buck the consensus of his party when necessary.
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:19.400]   I think he recently, I would say lambasted, he phrased it very delicately, but criticized
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:23.360]   Kamala Harris' proposed tax on unrealized capital gains.
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:27.680]   So I like people who are willing to challenge the orthodoxies in their own party because
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:29.880]   it says they actually have convictions.
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:32.120]   And so whoever the Democrats put up, I hope it's someone like that.
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:41.840]   And for my part, I will, I have and continue to have beliefs that will challenge Republicans,
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:46.400]   that on the face of it may not be the policies that poll on paper as the policies you're
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:51.400]   supposed to adopt as a Republican candidate, but what a true leader does doesn't just tell
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:53.400]   people what they want to hear.
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:56.600]   You tell people what they need to hear and you tell people what your actual convictions
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:57.600]   are.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:01.360]   And this idea that I don't want to create a right wing entitlement state or a nanny state,
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:02.360]   I want to shut it down.
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:05.560]   That challenges the presuppositions of where a lot of the conservative movement is right
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.560]   now.
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:10.400]   I don't think the bill to cap credit card interest rates is a good idea because that's
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:14.560]   a price control just like Kamala Harris' price controls and will reduce access to credit.
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:20.080]   I don't think that we want a crony capitalist state showering private benefits on selected
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:26.200]   industries that favor us or that we want to expand the CFPB or the FTC's remit.
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:28.440]   And somehow we're going to trust it because it's under our watch.
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:29.480]   No, I believe in shutting it down.
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:33.440]   That challenges a lot of the current direction of the conservative movement.
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:37.640]   You know, I believe in certain issues that, you know, maybe even outside the scope of
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.400]   what Republicans currently care about right now.
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:45.200]   One of the things that I oppose, for example, is this is not a top issue in American politics,
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:48.040]   but just to give you a sense for, you know, how I think and view the world.
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:53.960]   I'm against factory farming of a large scale of, you know, you could sort of say putting
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:59.760]   a, you know, the mistreatment of, it's one thing to say that you need it for your sustenance
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:00.760]   and that's great.
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:04.360]   But it's another to say that you have to do it in a factory farming setting that gives
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:09.000]   special exemptions from historical laws that have existed that are the product of crony
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000]   capitalism.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.740]   I'm against crony capitalism in all its forms.
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:14.680]   I'm against the influence of mega money in politics.
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:17.920]   I don't think that's been good either for Democrats or Republicans.
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:22.080]   Some of those views, I think, are not necessarily the traditional Republican, right?
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:26.160]   You know, orthodoxy reading chapter and verse from what the Republican Party platform has
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:27.160]   been.
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:31.760]   It's not against the Republican Party platform, but it's asking what the future of our movement
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:32.840]   is.
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:36.160]   Some of these things are hard, like getting money out of politics.
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:37.640]   Getting mega money, getting mega money.
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:38.640]   The mega money.
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:39.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:42.240]   As long as it exists, you've got to play the game if you're going to play to win.
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:46.840]   I think it's one of the things I realized is that you just can't compete without it,
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.840]   but you want to win the game in order to change the game.
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:55.160]   I think that that's something that I keep in mind as well.
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:57.200]   You have written a lot.
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:00.960]   You're exceptionally productive, but even just looking book-wise, you've written basically
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:04.480]   a book a year for the last four years.
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:08.760]   When you're writing, when you're thinking about how to solve the problems of the world,
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:14.240]   how to develop your policy, how do you think?
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:21.040]   I need quiet time, extended periods of it that are separated from the rush of the day-to-day
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.280]   or the travel.
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:27.280]   I actually think a lot better when I'm working out and physically active, so if I'm running,
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:31.320]   playing tennis, lifting, somehow for me, that really opens up my mind.
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.400]   Then I need a significant amount of time after that with a notebook, because I carry around
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:39.040]   a notebook everywhere I go and write it down in there.
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:42.960]   Is the notebook full of chaotic thoughts or is it structured?
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:43.960]   Sometimes it's chaotic.
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:44.960]   Sometimes it's structured.
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:45.960]   It's a little bit of both.
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:49.280]   Sometimes I have a thought that I know I don't want to forget later, I'll immediately jot
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:50.280]   it down.
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:54.160]   Other times, in the flight over here, I had a much more structured layout of I got a lot
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:57.360]   of different projects in the air, for example, and I cross-pollinate.
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:01.200]   I was in the shower this morning, had a bunch of thoughts, collected those on my plane ride
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:03.320]   over here.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:07.960]   I think that writing is something in all of its forms that helps me.
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:12.440]   It's one of the things that actually helped me this year was actually writing this book.
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:15.940]   You're going through a presidential campaign, you're going at super speed.
[02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:20.000]   If I was to do the presidential campaign again, the thing I would do is actually to take more
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.240]   structured breaks.
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:26.680]   I don't mean breaks isn't just like vacations, but I mean breaks to reflect on what's actually
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:28.760]   happening.
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:32.520]   Probably the biggest mistake I made is last time around, heading into the first debate,
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:36.080]   I was in nine different states over seven days.
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:42.200]   I would have just taken that as a pause, where halfway through, you've established relevance.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:47.720]   Now make sure the country sees who you actually are in full rather than just the momentum
[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:50.480]   competitive-driven version of you.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:55.000]   I just think that that's taking those moments to just take stock of where you are.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000]   Do some writing.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.040]   I didn't do much writing during the presidential campaign.
[02:29:58.040 --> 02:29:59.800]   I enjoy writing.
[02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:02.480]   It's part of how I center myself.
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:06.080]   It's part of what this book allowed me to do is, okay, I ran that whirlwind of a campaign.
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:10.340]   The first thing I started doing after I collected myself for a couple of weeks was take the
[02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:12.560]   pen and start writing.
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:15.440]   I was committed to writing that book, whether or not anybody read it.
[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:17.240]   I was just writing it for myself.
[02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:19.400]   Actually, it started in a very different form.
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:21.840]   It was very personal, reflection-oriented.
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:24.320]   Most of that, funny enough, I've learned about writing the books, Lex has-
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:25.320]   Edited it out.
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:28.920]   It just didn't end up in the book because it went in a different direction than what's
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:31.360]   interesting for a publisher to publish.
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:35.400]   For each of my books, the things that I started writing ended up never in the book anyway
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:39.960]   just because the topic ended up morphing, but the journey that led me to write this
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:40.960]   book.
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:41.960]   A lot of it in this book is still in there.
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:45.280]   This is my fourth book in four years, you're right.
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:49.440]   I hope it's the most important one, but it is certainly the product of an honest reflection
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:54.640]   that whatever it might do for the reader, it helped me to write it.
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:58.360]   I think that's one of the things that I learned from this campaign was not just all the policy
[02:30:58.360 --> 02:31:05.720]   lessons, but even just as a matter of personal practice, the ability to take spaces of time
[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:10.720]   to not only physically challenge yourself, work out, et cetera, but to give yourself
[02:31:10.720 --> 02:31:15.600]   the space to reflect, to recenter yourself on the why.
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:20.560]   Had I done that, I think I would have been even more centered on the mission the whole
[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:25.400]   time rather than you get attacked on the way you're thrown off your tilt or thrown off
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:26.400]   your balance.
[02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:29.640]   Sometimes it's a lot harder for someone else to do that to you if you've really centered
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:30.640]   yourself on your own purpose.
[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:33.320]   It's probably one of my biggest learnings.
[02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:36.520]   You've mentioned the first primary debate.
[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:41.220]   More than almost basically anybody I've ever seen, you stepped into some really intense
[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:48.760]   debates on your own podcast, but in general, in all kinds of walks of life, whether it's
[02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:55.400]   debates with protesters or debates with people that really disagree with you, like the radical
[02:31:55.400 --> 02:32:02.560]   opposite of you, what's the philosophy behind that and what's the psychology of being able
[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:05.880]   to be calm through all of that, which you seem to be able to do?
[02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:07.480]   I enjoy debate.
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:14.080]   For me, I think, just in ordinary life, forget about a formal debate setting, whenever I've
[02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:21.600]   received criticism or a contrary view, my first impulse is always, "Are they right?"
[02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:24.400]   It's always a possibility, right?
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:28.840]   Most of the time, what happens is you understand the other side's argument, but you emerge
[02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:31.800]   with a stronger conviction in your own belief, right?
[02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:36.360]   You know your own beliefs better if you can state the best argument for the other side,
[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:38.920]   but sometimes you do change your mind, and I think that that's happened over the course
[02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:39.920]   of my life as well.
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:44.560]   I think no one's a thinking human being unless that happens once in a while too, and so just
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:49.160]   the idea of the pursuit of truth through open debate and inquiry, that's always just been
[02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:50.880]   part of my identity, part of who I am.
[02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:51.880]   I'm wired that way.
[02:32:51.880 --> 02:32:53.080]   I thrive on it.
[02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:54.480]   I enjoy it.
[02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:59.640]   Even my relationships with my closest friends are built around heated debates and deep-seated
[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:05.520]   agreement, disagreements, and I just think that's beautiful, not just about human relationships,
[02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:07.600]   but it's particularly beautiful about America, right?
[02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:14.520]   Because it's part of the culture of this country more so than other countries, China, India,
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:20.520]   Asian cultures, even a lot of European cultures are very different where that's considered
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:21.520]   not genteel behavior.
[02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:26.600]   It's not the respectful behavior, whereas for us, part of what makes this country great
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:30.200]   is you could disagree like hell and still get together at the dinner table at the end
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.800]   of it.
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:36.640]   I think we've lost some of that, but I'm on a bit of a mission to bring that back, and
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:41.680]   so I don't know whether it's in politics or not, I'm committed in that next step, whatever
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:43.720]   the path is over the next four years.
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:50.320]   One of the things I'm committed to doing is making sure that I go out of my way to talk
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:53.840]   to people who actually disagree with me, and I think it's a big part of how we're gonna
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:55.260]   save our country.
[02:33:55.260 --> 02:34:00.000]   Are they right is a thing I actually literally see you do, so you are listening to the other
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.000]   person.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.560]   It's for my own benefit, to be honest, selfish.
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:07.720]   You also don't lose your shit, so you don't take it personally, you don't get emotional,
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:11.760]   but you get emotional sort of in a positive way, you get passionate, but you don't get,
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:19.560]   it doesn't, I've never seen you broken, like to where they, do they get you like outraged?
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:22.640]   It's always, probably because you just love the heat.
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:27.400]   I love the heat and I'm a curious person, so I'm kind of, I'm always curious about what's
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:31.240]   actually getting the other, what's motivating the person on the other side.
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:34.600]   That curiosity I think is actually the best antidote, right, because if you just try to
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:39.260]   stay calm in the face of somebody attacking you, that's kind of fake, but if you're kind
[02:34:39.260 --> 02:34:45.200]   of curious about them, right, genuinely just wondering, I think most people are good people
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:50.640]   inherently, we all maybe get misguided from time to time, but what's actually, what is
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:53.960]   it that's moving that person to go in such a different direction than you?
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:57.960]   I think as long as you're curious about that, you know, I mean, the climate change protesters
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:04.020]   that have interrupted my events, I'm as fascinated by the psychology of what's moving them and
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:08.880]   what they might be hungry for as I am concerned about rebutting the content of what they're
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:14.160]   saying to me, and I think that that's certainly something I care to revive.
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:18.640]   We don't talk about in politics that much, but reviving that sense of curiosity I think
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:24.980]   is in a certain way, one of the ways we're going to be able to disagree, but still remain
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:27.400]   friends and fellow citizens at the end of it.
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:28.400]   I agree with you.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:33.840]   I think fundamentally most people are good, and one of the things I love most about humans
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:36.880]   is the very thing you said, which is curiosity.
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:38.680]   I think we should lean into that.
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:39.680]   You're a curious person.
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:45.360]   You know, this podcast is basically born of your curiosity, I'm sure, and so I just think
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:48.720]   we need more of that in America, that kind of, you know, remember when I talked about
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:52.280]   our founding fathers, we were joking about it, but they were inventors, they were writers,
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:56.160]   they were political theorists, they were founders of a nation.
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:01.000]   They kind of had that boundless curiosity too, and I think part of what's happened culturally
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.160]   in the country is we've gotten to this place where, you know, we've been told that stay
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:09.980]   in your lane, you know, you don't have an expert degree in that, therefore you can't
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:11.520]   have an opinion about it.
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:12.520]   I don't know.
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:16.320]   I think that's not, it's a little bit un-American in terms of the culture of it, and yeah, it's
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:19.440]   one of the things I like about you and why I was looking forward to this conversation
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:26.760]   too is it's cool to have intellectual interests that span sports to culture, to politics,
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:30.880]   to philosophy, and it's not like you just have to be an expert trained in one of those
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:36.000]   things to be able to engage in it, but actually maybe, just maybe, you might even be better
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:39.640]   at each of those things because you're curious about the other.
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:40.960]   The renaissance man, if you will.
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:46.440]   I think we've lost a little bit of that, that concept in America, but it's certainly something
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:49.160]   that is important to me.
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:52.960]   And this year it's been kind of cool after leaving the campaign, I've been doing a wide
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:53.960]   range of things, right?
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:57.880]   I've been picking up my tennis game again, I've practiced at the Ohio State.
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:36:59.240]   You're damn good at tennis.
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:02.320]   I used to be better, but I'm picking it up again.
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:08.360]   Somebody online was trying to, correctly, I think you shot a very particular angle of
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:09.360]   that video.
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:13.040]   I think they were criticizing your backhand was weak, potentially, because you're-
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:17.600]   That would be a fair criticism, but it's gotten better again, it's gotten better recently.
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.560]   I've been practicing with the Ohio State team in the morning, they're like number one in
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:23.840]   the country or close to it.
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.160]   Now, the guys on the team play, but there's a couple of coaches who were recently on the
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:31.360]   team, one of whom used to be a guy who used to play with the juniors who invited me out,
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:34.900]   so I hit with them in the mornings alongside the team.
[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:42.020]   My goal, I should be careful here.
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:46.700]   My hips are telling me this, so I've been playing so many days a week that I set a goal
[02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:50.720]   for myself by the end of it to play in a particular tournament, but we'll see if that happens
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:51.720]   or not.
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:55.300]   But regardless, it's been fun to get back into tennis.
[02:37:55.300 --> 02:37:59.520]   I was an executive producer on a movie, something I've never done before, it's called City of
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:00.520]   Dreams.
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:04.280]   It's about a story of a young man who was trafficked into the United States.
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:08.080]   It's a thriller, so it's a very cool movie to be a part of.
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:11.840]   I have actually started a couple of companies, one company in particular that I think is
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:17.960]   going to be significant this year, guiding some of the other businesses that I've gotten
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:19.960]   off the ground in the past.
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:26.520]   So for me, I'm re-energized now, where I was in the thick of politics for a full year there
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:30.640]   and getting a little bit of oxygen outside of politics, doing some things in the private
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:37.080]   sector has actually given me a renewed sense of energy to get back into driving change
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:38.080]   through public service.
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:44.920]   - Well, it's been fun watching you do all these fascinating things, but I do hope that
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:52.240]   you have a future in politics as well, 'cause it's nice to have somebody that has rigorously
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:57.680]   developed their ideas and is honest about presenting them and is willing to debate
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:59.560]   those ideas out in public space.
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:04.960]   So I would love for you and people like you to represent the future of American politics.
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:10.380]   So Vivek, thank you so much for every time I'm swiveling in this chair, I'm thinking
[02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:11.380]   of Thomas Jefferson.
[02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:12.380]   - It's good.
[02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:13.380]   That was my goal.
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:17.280]   - So big shout out to Thomas Jefferson for the swivel chair, and thank you so much for
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:18.280]   talking to me, Vivek.
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:19.280]   This was fun.
[02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:20.280]   - Thank you, man.
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:22.800]   - I love your curiosity about Thomas Jefferson, whether you cut this or not.
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:28.180]   Of course, he wrote 16,000 essays in his life, letters, right?
[02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:30.440]   So he said, "I've written four books in four years."
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:35.480]   That is nothing compared to how prolific this guy was.
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:37.160]   Anyway, good stuff, man.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:38.160]   Thanks for having me.
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:41.560]   - Neither of us will ever live up to anything close to Thomas Jefferson.
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:42.840]   - I love your curiosity, man.
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.000]   Thanks for reading the book and appreciated your feedback on it as well, and hopefully
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000]   we'll do this again sometime.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000]   - Yep.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000]   Thank you, brother.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:50.000]   - Thanks, dude.
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:53.920]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Vivek Ramaswamy.
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:57.680]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:03.060]   And now, let me leave you with some words from George Orwell, "Political language is
[02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:09.840]   designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:13.760]   solidity to pure wind."
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:16.360]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:17.360]   - Thank you.
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:17.360]   - Thank you.
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:18.360]   - Thank you.
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:18.360]   - Thank you.
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:23.360]   - Thank you.
