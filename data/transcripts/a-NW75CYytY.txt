[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.520]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 181.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:16.560]   I'm here as always in my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.280]   joined by my professor, professor?
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.160]   That's the second time I've done that.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.420]   My producer, Jesse.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.200]   I keep trying to promote the professor.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.680]   Jesse, we made a mistake last week
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.760]   that we've been hearing about, haven't we?
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.720]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.440]   We both have been getting emails.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.120]   He's been getting emails at his address, mine at mine.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.800]   Here's what happened.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.720]   I mixed up fantasy writer, Brandon Sanderson,
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   with writer, Pat Ruthfuss, and I know the difference.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.040]   I read a bunch of Pat Ruthfuss, I know Brandon Sanderson.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.760]   It's just sometimes when you're recording,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.400]   your mind is going to a bunch of different places.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.160]   At once, to try to set up what's coming next,
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.880]   and you can fall into these weird traps,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.640]   like me calling Jesse a professor.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.280]   And so I was mixing up Pat with Brandon,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.600]   and Deep Questions listeners were not happy about that.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.440]   We got some emails.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.640]   You would think, Jesse, you would think,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.360]   based on the number of emails we got,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.280]   and their upsetness, that we had announced
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.440]   that we were starting a new podcast
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400]   in which me and Vladimir Putin would try
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.040]   to encourage parents not to vaccinate their children.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.200]   You would think that's what we announced,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   based on the volume and negativity of the feedback
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.240]   for messing up those two authors.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.000]   So my apologies to Brandon,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.880]   my apologies to Pat for mixing you up.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.080]   I don't think Brandon cares.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   I think the $21 million Kickstarter that he just did
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.880]   is probably more on his mind
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840]   than Deep Questions mixing up his name.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.880]   - I like the passion of your fan base, though.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.160]   It's great.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.320]   - Yeah, well, okay, here's the telling thing
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.400]   about my fan base.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.440]   So a few weeks ago, when I didn't know the name
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.800]   of the starting quarterback of the Bengals,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400]   crickets, no one cares.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   When I mess up the author of the King Killer series,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.600]   and Chronicles, and the author who finished
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.480]   the Wheel of Time, hundreds of emails.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.320]   So I think that tells us something about our fans.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.440]   Let's not lean into sports commentary
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.600]   and ultimate fighting minutia.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.800]   I think sticking carefully in the realm of fantasy,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.480]   this is probably more our people.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.600]   So I think we learned a lot this week, Jesse.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.920]   - Yeah, it was good.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   - So what I wanna do is a core idea.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.200]   I think the series has been going well.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.760]   The core idea of videos, which we have been releasing
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   as standalone videos at youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.360]   have been some of the most popular videos
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.760]   we've been releasing.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640]   When Jesse and I had the original idea
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.840]   for doing a series of core idea segments, I made a list.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.760]   Well, here are top of mind, the core ideas
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   I come back to again and again in my writing
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.040]   and on this podcast.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.880]   We have almost gotten through that entire list,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.680]   but there is one topic left on that original list,
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.980]   and that is the topic I want to cover today,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.000]   which is the case against email.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.080]   Now, this is the ideas that I fully articulated
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   in my most recent book, "A World Without Email."
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.320]   I also explored a lot of these ideas
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.040]   in my New Yorker writing.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.120]   So if you look back at my New Yorker archive
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.680]   from before and even after the publication
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.200]   of "A World Without Email," I also explored
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.320]   a lot of these ideas in the pages of the New Yorker as well.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.660]   I want to capture them all now in one core idea segment.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.040]   There's four parts here that I want to tackle.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.600]   One, I'm going to introduce the notion
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.560]   of the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.040]   It's the most important piece of vocabulary
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.280]   that you will come away from this segment having learned.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.380]   If you listen to one thing, know this term.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.960]   Two, I want to get into why the hyperactive hive mind
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.120]   is such a villain in the context of modern knowledge work.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.480]   Three, I'm going to tackle if it's so bad,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.640]   why is it so common?
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.260]   And then four, we will briefly touch on,
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.600]   so what should we do about it?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.440]   All right, so that's my goal.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.760]   So let's start with this first point,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.680]   the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.240]   So the name of my book was "A World Without Email,"
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.240]   and I got any number of seemingly clever notes from people,
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.920]   often in response to, let's say, a mailing list,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.480]   mailing from my mailing list, where they would say,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.760]   "Ha, I'm reading an email from you,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.360]   "and you are saying we should have no email in the world.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.600]   "Gotcha," right?
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   They're joking, but I would get that comment a lot,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.120]   like, "How ironic is this?"
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.880]   And this is where I need to clarify
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.920]   that the issue that I come after in that book
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.480]   is not email by itself.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.420]   No particular beef with email as a technology.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.200]   The actual villain of that book,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.140]   the thing I think we should have banished more
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.680]   from our world is what I dubbed
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.060]   the hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.600]   Now, this is not an elegant title.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.700]   I couldn't call the book
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.920]   "A World Without the Hyperactive Hive Mind Workflow,"
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.600]   but that's probably what I should have named it
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.320]   because that is accurately what the book is really about.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.420]   So what is this thing, the hyperactive hive mind workflow?
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.560]   It is a means of collaboration
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.160]   in which the bulk of your collaboration occurs
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   with ad hoc, unscheduled digital messages.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.940]   So we're trying to figure something out.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.780]   I'll send you a message, you'll send me one back,
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.280]   I'll bounce it back to you.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.600]   So maybe it's, you know,
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.460]   Jesse and I scrambling over the furor created
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.500]   when we mixed up Brandon Sanderson with Pat Rufus,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.580]   and maybe I sent him an email,
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.660]   "Hey, what should we do about this?"
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.540]   He sends one back, like,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.860]   "Well, maybe we should meet about it."
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.780]   He's like, "Well, what about these times?"
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.220]   You're just sending messages back and forth.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.060]   They're ad hoc,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.460]   so it's not like you had a particular plan.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.300]   It's just in the moment,
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.940]   let me send this message, and they're unscheduled.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.540]   So there's not like a particular time
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.000]   when this communication is going to happen.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.140]   Email made the hyperactive hive mind workflow possible,
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.700]   but two key points here, it doesn't make it inevitable.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.840]   So having email around makes it possible
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.600]   for you to do ad hoc back and forth messaging
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.700]   as the main way that you coordinate,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.320]   but it doesn't mean that's the way you have to.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.820]   And two, once that became dominant,
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.620]   other tools came along that made it even easier
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.580]   to engage in the hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.020]   So you got, for example, instant messenger tools
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.660]   like Slack, like WhatsApp,
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.860]   they all are enabling the same workflow.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.700]   And it's this hyperactive hive mind workflow
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.160]   that I want to put our attention on.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.880]   So this brings us to the second point,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.300]   what's wrong with the hyperactive hive mind workflow?
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.220]   Well, let me start by saying in the abstract, nothing.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.060]   It's actually a very natural way to coordinate.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.540]   It is in a pre-digital age,
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.800]   the primary way that human beings work together.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.920]   If there was three of you out hunting a mastodon,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.880]   it's a hundred thousand years ago,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.060]   you would coordinate using the hyperactive hive mind workflow
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.180]   it'd be ad hoc back and forth, unscheduled messages.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.660]   Hey, you come over here, stop there.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.500]   I think he's over here.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.700]   You go around that way.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.860]   It's a natural way to human beings collaborate.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.300]   So there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.540]   It's very natural.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.980]   It's also quite flexible, right?
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.940]   You have one tool, one communication tool.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.580]   You figure things out on the fly.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.260]   There's very little overhead,
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.740]   very little predetermination required
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.620]   to figure out how to get things done.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.140]   We'd sort of rock and roll and get things done.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.080]   So abstractly speaking, there's nothing particularly wrong
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.760]   with this mode of collaboration.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.960]   The issue is that it doesn't scale.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.360]   So email, the arrival of email made it possible,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.980]   made it possible for very large groups of people
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.380]   to coordinate with each other on a large number of things,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.420]   all using this hyperactive hive mind.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.260]   Because now with almost no friction,
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.860]   I can shoot off a message to almost anyone in my organization
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.220]   almost any of our clients, any of our contractors.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.180]   We have this very low friction simplified
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.840]   way of communicating.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.720]   It is in the scaling that the hyperactive hive mind
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.460]   began to weave its web of negative implications
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.340]   in the modern office.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.660]   And here's why.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.300]   Let's walk through this thought experiment.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.620]   If I work with one other person
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.700]   and we're working on one thing
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.220]   and we're not in the same room,
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.540]   going back and forth with unscheduled email messages
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.260]   is a perfectly reasonable way for us to coordinate.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.380]   All right, well, did you get this?
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.220]   Should we meet?
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.040]   Well, when can you meet?
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.880]   What do you think about this?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.700]   We could go back and forth.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.100]   It's a perfectly reasonable way for us to coordinate.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.980]   So let's say a typical thing,
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.020]   just so we can use round numbers.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.060]   So we want to coordinate about,
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.160]   it's going to require about 10 back and forth messages.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.000]   That's fine.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.700]   10 back and forth messages over the course of a day or two,
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.860]   no big deal.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.540]   Now imagine like the typical knowledge worker,
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.420]   we've now scaled up the number of people we work with
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.760]   and the number of things we work on.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.140]   And now we have 10 different things that are going on.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.220]   A big project over here,
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.060]   a report that has to get to a client,
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.220]   trying to reschedule a visit with a candidate
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.940]   that's coming in to interview.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.780]   We're trying to figure out a problem,
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.620]   working back and forth with facilities
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.780]   because there's something that has to be repaired.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.660]   So we have like 10 different things going on.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.900]   Each of them are being worked out
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.820]   with the hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.040]   Each of them on average,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.400]   maybe it's going to require about 10 back and forth messages
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.380]   to figure out.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.400]   Each of them on average is relatively time sensitive.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.320]   We need to get a resolution in the next day or two.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.800]   So we have 10 messages for each of these things,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.320]   each of which needs to be seen, processed,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.540]   and replied to within the next day or two.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.720]   Let's multiply these numbers through.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.920]   10 things, 10 messages,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.800]   that's a hundred total messages that have to be seen,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.720]   received, and replied to all within a day or two.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.500]   This is where we begin to get into trouble
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.700]   in the modern workplace,
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.440]   because now if there's going to be a hundred messages,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.340]   I'm going to have to get through each of them
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.140]   in a relatively timely fashion.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.180]   In the next day or so, there is no alternative for me,
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.880]   but to constantly check
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.040]   whatever communication channel we're using.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.820]   If it's an email firm, I'm always in my inbox.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.420]   If we're a Slack firm, I have to keep checking Slack.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.620]   And the reason why I have to do this
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.780]   is not because I'm lazy, not because I'm bad at tools,
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.600]   but because there's a hundred messages
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.920]   that are going to have to be hit back
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.620]   over that virtual ping pong net
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.940]   pretty quickly after they arrive.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.880]   So I have to check constantly.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.480]   And the data on this shows this is exactly what we do.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.540]   In my book, I talk about a really good comprehensive dataset
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.140]   from the software company RescueTime.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.580]   They studied tens of thousands of knowledge workers
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.140]   and found that they were checking inboxes on average
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.860]   once every six minutes.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.120]   It's required.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.500]   If you have hundreds of messages
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.560]   that are going to have to be seen,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.940]   each of which is going to have to be responded to
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.940]   relatively quickly, just so progress can be made
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.460]   on the various projects you're working on.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.100]   All right, so now we have a situation
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.660]   where we have to check an inbox or a chat channel
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.700]   once every six minutes,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.460]   because this is the only way now work is going to unfold.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.460]   Every one of those checks induces a cognitive context shift.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.540]   You see an inbox full of information,
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.780]   different than what you're primarily working on,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.100]   a lot of which is urgent,
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.220]   all of which is tied to specific individuals
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.660]   that need things from you.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.660]   That is a arresting context shift.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.300]   Your brain begins to immediately shift over its context
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.740]   to those things you see in your inbox.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.220]   Now, the issue is you're just checking your inbox
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.380]   real quick because you're seeing,
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.540]   hey, did the reply come back yet from Jesse
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.380]   about when we're going to set up our next meeting?
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.460]   So you pretty quickly try to bring your attention back
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.300]   to what you're doing,
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.780]   but you've already induced that context shift.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.980]   That has a cost.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.060]   Your cognitive capacity is going to be reduced
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.060]   and for a while after that check,
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.740]   10, 15 minutes after that check,
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.700]   you're still going to have a reduced cognitive capacity
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.620]   as your brain is now in this intermediate state
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.100]   between what you were focusing on before
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.780]   and what you just saw, and then you stopped looking at that.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.440]   You tried to go back to the main thing.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.740]   You have what's called attention residue.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.340]   Cognitive capacity is reduced.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.180]   Not only that,
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.820]   but you're going to get a low grade sense of anxiety
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.260]   because you see all of these unresolved tasks
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.020]   in that inbox, all tied to people.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.980]   We take seriously requests from people
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.860]   and you get an overall fatigue.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.020]   This is this burnout effect that office workers feel
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.300]   whereby two in the afternoon,
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.260]   they're just done trying to do anything hard
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.460]   because they burnt out their brain,
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.980]   shifting those contexts back and forth.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.160]   It's the shifts that kill you, the shifts that kill you.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.320]   So we've created a hyperactive hive mind scaled up,
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.900]   creates this need to have to check inboxes or channels
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.140]   all the time because you have a hundred messages a day
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.980]   that you have to hit back over the ping pong fence.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.460]   You can't wait four hours to do that.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.660]   And all those context shifts completely fry our brain.
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.620]   And so it's misery making, it's fatiguing,
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.860]   it's anxiety producing, and we get a lot less done.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.740]   So it's a huge problem that we try to coordinate
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.460]   so much work with the hyperactive hive mind workflow,
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.300]   not because it doesn't make sense, it's very flexible,
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.140]   but because it doesn't scale.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.740]   At scale, it requires constant shifts
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.780]   and our brains simply can't do that.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.020]   So if the hyperactive hive mind is so bad,
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.820]   this brings us to our third point, why is it so common?
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.340]   Well, I looked into this in my book
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.380]   and in my New Yorker reporting,
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.100]   and here's the story I uncovered.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.460]   It is largely accidental.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.960]   No one ever said coordinating all of our work
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.940]   with these rapid back and forth unscheduled messages
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.820]   is going to make us more productive.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.140]   No one ever said, look, there's going to be
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.320]   some sacrifices to this,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.620]   but it's going to be the right way to work.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.660]   It's going to unlock new levels of production.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.380]   No one ever thought that or said that.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.460]   We stumbled into this way of working
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.820]   and here's how it largely unfolded.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.580]   In the 1990s, email made a rapid move
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.720]   through the front office.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.180]   That is when most businesses that have standard
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.700]   computer cubicle style knowledge work,
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.220]   adopted email and began to use it extensively.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.620]   And the reason they did, again, I went back to the archives,
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.420]   I was looking at the New York Times business section,
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.560]   I was looking at articles in other technology magazines,
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.180]   trying to document, look at the documents
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.100]   of how people were talking about email
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.940]   when it first spread in the 90s.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.420]   The reason why email spread is not because they said,
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.420]   we will have this utopia where we can communicate
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.300]   with each other all the time.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.060]   It was because it was replacing three existing tools,
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.800]   fax machines, voicemails, and interoffice memos.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.480]   It was a better version of those three tools,
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.680]   which were very popularly used in the decades
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.980]   leading up to the arrival of email.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.260]   And email was unquestionably a better way
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260]   of implementing that communication.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.940]   Attaching a file is much better than faxing,
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.700]   sending an email is almost always much better
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.340]   than leaving a voicemail that requires someone
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.520]   to type in a code and listen to you actually talking.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.700]   Sending a CC message about the new parking policy
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.780]   to the whole office is clearly much more efficient
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.020]   than having to print that out
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.520]   and put it in everyone's mailboxes.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.760]   So it was solving a real problem,
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.520]   which was there is asynchronous communication that existed.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.980]   Those three tools implemented it.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.840]   Email was cheaper, had more features, and was faster.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.900]   That's why it spread.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.460]   Once it was in people's offices though,
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.160]   once people had those addresses,
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.680]   once the friction was removed
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.160]   for any interpersonal communication,
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.700]   the hyperactive Hivemind workflow emerged naturally,
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.540]   not by choice, but naturally.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.660]   And why did it emerge?
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.700]   Well, this gets complicated,
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.900]   but here's just a summary of it.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.940]   It emerged because we had an ethic of autonomy
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.240]   in the context of knowledge work.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.920]   We had an ethic that in knowledge work,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.040]   it's up to individuals to figure out
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.460]   how to organize their work.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.960]   Productivity is personal, we said.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.400]   How you keep track of things,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.520]   how you choose what you say yes to, no to,
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.240]   how you manage your time during the day,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.020]   how you manage your tasks,
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.860]   that's up to you as the individual.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.800]   Buy a Cal Newport book, buy a Stephen Covey book,
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.540]   buy a David Allen book, that's none of our business.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.880]   We give you objectives and we motivate you,
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.280]   but you figure out how to do your work.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.120]   That is the dominant ethic in knowledge work
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.980]   for various reasons.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.400]   In that context where we leave the organization
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.600]   and execution work up to the individuals.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.960]   It is not surprising that when this new tool emerged,
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.280]   we began to use it in the most flexible,
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.360]   easiest way possible.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.960]   The hyperactive Hivemind was convenient and flexible,
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.480]   so we all sort of fell into it
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.120]   because there was no one looking down
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.280]   at the organization as a whole
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.760]   and saying, "What's the best way to do this work?"
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.840]   When we make our own decisions,
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   we end up with whatever is easiest in the moment.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   And so we stumble backwards in this swamp of autonomy
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.880]   towards a world in which the hyperactive Hivemind
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.700]   was dominant.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.760]   And we look up and by the early 2000s,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.520]   found ourselves context shifting every five to six minutes,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.340]   miserable, barely able to get any real work done.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.940]   So that brings us to the final point,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.360]   which is what should we do about this situation?
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.240]   Well, now that we know that it's largely accidental
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.480]   that we arrived here,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.920]   now that we know that there's more damage
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.040]   than we may have expected occurring
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.420]   because of all these context shifts,
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.560]   this should embolden us to seek solutions.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.720]   And in seeking these solutions,
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.460]   I think the first point we have to make
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.520]   is that this is not a game
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.840]   that is going to be one with individual habits.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.800]   This has been, up until most recently,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.540]   the most common way we've tried to deal
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.800]   with the email problem, which is say,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.840]   "Well, people are just using email wrong.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.000]   "Don't check it so much.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.280]   "You're addicted to it."
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.700]   We introduced that terminology of addiction.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.200]   Remember when the hyperactive hive mind
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.440]   first began to emerge,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.080]   and we first noticed it when people
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.040]   were using early generation blackberries all the time
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.140]   to keep up with the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.080]   we introduced the term crackberries
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.820]   and tried to make it seem like these people
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.720]   had some sort of weird addiction to this thing.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.000]   They need to get rid of that addiction.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.680]   It's orthogonal to their actual work, but it wasn't.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.200]   They're checking the blackberries all the time
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.520]   because there was more work being worked through
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.980]   with ad hoc unscheduled messages,
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.200]   and they had to respond to those messages
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.800]   for work to unfold.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.580]   It was required, not a flaw.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.200]   So we're not gonna solve this problem
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.480]   by saying just check your email less often,
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.640]   or write better subject lines, or have better filters,
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.560]   or if you move from Gmail to superhuman
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.000]   or from superhuman to hey,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.120]   that if you just have enough automatic filters and features,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.560]   you can tame this problem.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.580]   You're just not handling email well.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.000]   But when we recognize that the problem
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.880]   is actually the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.160]   we know none of these individual habit fixes will be enough.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160]   The reason why we have to keep checking our email,
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.480]   we have to keep checking Slack,
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.400]   is not because we have bad habits or bad setups,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.960]   but because we have 10 different things
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.800]   that are being organized with unscheduled messages,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.160]   and we can't ignore those messages.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.680]   Each of these things has 10 messages
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.640]   that has to get sent back and forth today
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.700]   because we need to finish this by the end of the day.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.880]   So I have to keep checking,
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.120]   'cause if I wait four hours
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.520]   before I answer message number two,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.920]   we're not gonna get the message number 10
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.760]   before the day is done,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.580]   and it's a problem.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.600]   We check email all the time
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.640]   because the hyperactive hive mind demands it.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.720]   If that is the way we coordinate our work,
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.660]   there is no alternative
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.960]   to constantly checking in on these channels
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.240]   and keeping these messages bouncing back and forth.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.080]   Can't solve it by checking email less often.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.240]   We can't solve it with better inboxes.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.220]   We can't solve it by changing norms.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.200]   We can't solve it with response time expectations changing.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.020]   You can say what you want
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.320]   about response time expectations.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.240]   We have 10 messages that have to get back and forth
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   to schedule this visit tomorrow.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.340]   That has to happen.
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.400]   Don't tell me our norm is
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.160]   don't expect an answer within 24 hours.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.740]   These 10 messages have to finish today
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.080]   because that person's coming tomorrow
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.280]   and we have to tell them what time their meeting is.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.600]   So how do we solve this problem?
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.840]   You replace the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.240]   We need alternative ways of collaborating
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.640]   that do not depend on unscheduled messages
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.640]   that require a response relatively quickly
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.560]   after they arrive in your inbox.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.200]   That is the only way to solve this problem.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.480]   And that is gonna require hard work.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.080]   It means we're gonna have to identify
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.520]   what are the different things we do again and again
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.240]   in my job in our office.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.940]   And for each of those things actually work out together
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.640]   alternative systems for collaboration
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.200]   that don't require unscheduled messages.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.880]   And each different type of thing you do
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.160]   might require a different system.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.680]   And each system might require a polishing
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.320]   and optimization over time to get right.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.920]   And it's all a pain, but we have to do it
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.440]   because the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.600]   the flexible though convenient though cheap,
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.960]   is not scaling and it's killing us
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.640]   from a cognitive perspective.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.180]   And so that is the main argument I make
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.320]   in the end of that book, "A World Without Email."
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.520]   It's we have to start building from the ground up
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.680]   bespoke, clearly specified systems of collaboration
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.300]   that talk about when and how we communicate
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.240]   to get things done.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.120]   Unscheduled messages have to play a decreasing role
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.160]   in coordinating work.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.560]   So when I talk about a world without email,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.640]   I mean a world in which the hyperactive hive mind
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.040]   is rarely used.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.800]   Regularly occurring work has clear systems
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.240]   for how we collaborate that don't depend
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.480]   on unscheduled messages.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.080]   I could care less by the way about other uses for email.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.000]   Your broadcasting information, great.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.320]   I don't want you to mail it to me, that's fine.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.160]   You have a non-urgent request or question
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.480]   I can answer in a sentence or two,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.080]   yeah, email that to me and let me get to it
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.920]   when I wanna get to it.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.720]   That's a great use of email.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.500]   I'm happy with all of that.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.640]   The thing that's gonna kill us is we're going back
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.120]   and forth about something.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.520]   We gotta get that out of email.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.720]   We gotta get that out of Slack.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.920]   We gotta get that out of WhatsApp.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.920]   And we have to put in place bespoke systems
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.280]   that say here's when and how we communicate.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.240]   Now we're not context shifting.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.780]   Now we're not exhausted.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.560]   Now we're not reducing our cognitive capacity.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.720]   Now we can actually produce work without burning out
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.040]   and be proud of what we produce.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.240]   So when I'm making my case against email,
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.880]   I'm making my case against the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.040]   And when we know that's the villain, we know the solution.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.560]   We have to vanquish that particular enemy.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.040]   And yes, it's a pain because we have to replace him
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.560]   with alternative ways of getting things done.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.340]   But work is not supposed to be about friction reduction.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.160]   Work is not supposed to be about what's easiest.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.240]   It's about what works.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.980]   By definition, work is resistance against objects at rest.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.560]   It's supposed to be hard.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.960]   So yeah, it's a pain to figure out.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.040]   For this client memo we produce every month,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.440]   instead of just rock and rolling on email,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.600]   let's have a system where drafts go
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.720]   to these shared folders at these times.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.200]   And we use the comments and the designer knows
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.760]   that at this point he can grab what's
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.520]   in the shared document and design it.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.040]   And I'll sign off on it virtually.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.640]   And I have office hours every day.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.400]   And if you have questions, you come to my office hours.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.240]   That's when we discuss it.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.840]   You have to do stuff like that.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.680]   More overhead, more annoying, more delays.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.640]   But it gets rid of the need to have to check an inbox
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.520]   or check a chat channel,
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.340]   look for an unscheduled message and reply.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.480]   That is the key.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.780]   That is the world we need.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.380]   We have to get past this world where we just rock
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.580]   and roll with communication tools.
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.240]   We have to get more bespoke and more structured.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.720]   But if we do, we're all gonna be much happier
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.560]   and we're gonna get a lot more done.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.580]   All right, so that is my core idea.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.620]   The last core idea from my original list
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.760]   of ideas I wanted to tackle.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.120]   There's other core ideas I'll do
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.880]   and feel free to send in suggestions to me.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.080]   You can send that in to interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.500]   Other things you've heard me talk about,
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.840]   you think we should do a core ideas video on,
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.680]   I'm happy to hear it.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.480]   But that was the original list.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.040]   So our playlist will soon be completely up to date.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.000]   All right, well, we got a lot of good questions
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.560]   to get through today.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.920]   Before we do,
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.640]   talk about a couple of the sponsors
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.260]   that make this show possible.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.640]   First is My Body Tutor.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.160]   And My Body Tutor was founded by Adam Gilbert,
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.640]   who I have known for a long time.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.520]   As I've mentioned before,
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.780]   he used to be the fitness advice guy
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.520]   back in the early days of my study hacks blog.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.260]   His company, My Body Tutor,
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.820]   a brilliant idea, especially for our current moment,
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.800]   is a 100% online coaching program
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.100]   that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.120]   which is the lack of consistency.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.880]   They do this by giving you
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.080]   an online coach
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.600]   who helps come up with your plans
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.000]   around eating and exercising.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.560]   It makes sense for you and what you're trying to do
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.040]   and what's gonna be sustainable.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.240]   And then you check in with that coach daily.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.200]   See, that is the issue in health and fitness.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.440]   It's not figuring out what to do.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.920]   It is consistently doing it day after day
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.720]   and having a coach is the way to do that.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.000]   Now, of course, if you had to actually hire a trainer
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.520]   or a nutritionist to come to your house,
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.400]   it'd be really expensive.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.240]   But in the age of the internet, why do that?
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.000]   These coaches are online.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.160]   So now almost anyone has access
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.220]   to that type of consistency.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.340]   So anyways, I think it's a good idea.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.700]   I know he's been killing it,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.940]   especially during the pandemic
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.980]   when people stopped using gyms.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.580]   Adam and his coaches are the best in the world
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.540]   at delivering highly personal accounting and coaching.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.300]   So here's the good news,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.540]   'cause I know Adam and he's a good guy.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.460]   He is going to give Deep Questions listeners $50
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.380]   off their first month.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:22.380]   All you have to do is mention this podcast when you join.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.980]   If you have any questions,
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.300]   Adam wants you to call or text.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.580]   You can actually find his personal cell phone number
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.980]   at the top of every page of mybodytutor.com.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.660]   This is a highly personalized service.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.360]   I think that emphasizes it.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.380]   So go to mybodytutor, T-U-T-O-R,
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.860]   and mention Deep Questions when you sign up
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.540]   to get $50 off your first month.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.100]   But I also wanna talk about Blinkist,
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.500]   long-time sponsor of the show.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.980]   Now, Jesse, when we were last doing an ad for Blinkist,
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.100]   I had asked you to look up something
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.060]   on the Blinkist website and all hell broke loose.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.460]   Like, for one, your computer restarted,
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.800]   some weird capture thing happened,
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.740]   your browser overloaded,
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.180]   your smoke started coming out of the disk drive.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.620]   But the moral of that story is that
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.180]   the reason why that all started was
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.500]   you weren't seeing the Blinkist homepage
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.960]   'cause you were already logged in
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.380]   because you are a Blinkist user.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.660]   - Yeah, I am.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.700]   - And so let me ask you, I'll tell you how I use Blinkist.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.340]   How do you use, what's your Blinkist strategy these days?
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.300]   - Well, just this morning, I tried something new.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.980]   I went on to check out one of their audio books.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.100]   So for the sports gene with David Epstein.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.140]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.040]   - Before that, I was reading some of the blinks
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.060]   on the Ukraine crisis.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.460]   So I get a lot of those now.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.700]   - Well, so you're a more advanced user than I've been.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.560]   So like, I mainly read blinks of books.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.720]   But 15 minutes, you listen to it.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.060]   I like that you can listen to it now.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.900]   I think that's critical.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.720]   You can read them, of course,
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.700]   but you listen to these 10 to 15 minute summaries
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.400]   and I use it whenever I hear of a book where I think,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.840]   huh, should I read that?
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.760]   I go to the blink first and it actually really helps.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.920]   You can really get a sense.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.600]   I mean, it's not a good sign for the authors when I say no,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.040]   but you can really get a sense from these short blinks of,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.200]   oh, I see what this is about.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.160]   Okay, I get the idea, good enough.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.080]   And sometimes it's no, no, no.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.120]   I really want to go deeper on this.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.560]   And we should probably explain for the listener,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.240]   what are we talking about here?
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.320]   Blinkist is a subscription service.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.680]   What it gives you access to is these brief
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.040]   10 to 15 minute summaries of some of the best-selling,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.860]   most important nonfiction books of all time,
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.520]   but also other things as well.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.880]   They have blink summarizing podcasts.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.080]   They have blinks you're talking about now,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.000]   dealing with some breaking news even.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.120]   So, I mean, it's more than just nonfiction books,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.040]   but that's how they got started.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.200]   These high quality 10 to 15 minute summaries
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.360]   of important information.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.800]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.960]   just for our audience.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.000]   If you go to blinkist.com/deep,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.200]   the start a free seven day trial,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.060]   you will get 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.560]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.280]   blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.860]   and a seven day free trial, blinkist.com/deep.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:30.200]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.280]   Now I've gotten a couple of emails
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.080]   where people are asking how to submit questions.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.920]   So I'll briefly review,
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.640]   and all this information is at calnewport.com/podcast.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.960]   For the written questions, like we're gonna answer today,
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.540]   I send out every few months a survey
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.200]   to my email newsletter subscriber
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.760]   saying submit your questions.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.440]   You can submit as many questions as you want.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.880]   So if you wanna contribute written questions,
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.040]   you have to sign up for my email newsletter
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.280]   at calnewport.com and wait until the next time
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.520]   I send out that survey.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.600]   We probably have one coming up pretty soon, right Jesse?
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.620]   You look at the questions,
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.840]   we're probably getting to that point
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.960]   where we're gonna ask for new questions soon.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.520]   - Yeah, it'd be a good time to ask for some more
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.360]   in the spring time.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.880]   - So now's a good time to sign up for that newsletter
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.000]   if you wanna contribute.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.640]   The reason why I do that, by the way,
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.800]   is I figure people who subscribe to my newsletter
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.000]   and they're getting my weekly essay,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.880]   they know what I'm all about, they know my big ideas,
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.160]   they know my take on things,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.720]   they know the common vocabulary that I use.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.520]   So the questions they ask are way more on point
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.480]   for me and the show than if I just had a link
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.120]   for anyone in the world to send questions,
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.500]   we're gonna have, I don't know, a lot of questions about,
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.200]   I don't know what's popular these days, but K-pop bands.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.040]   - Crypto.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.000]   - Crypto, yeah, NFTs are K-pop bands.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.560]   So we do it that way.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.960]   The audio questions uses a completely different service
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.480]   called Speakpipe, but again, there's an easy link to it
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.640]   you can get at calnewport.com/podcast.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.320]   It allows you to record those audio questions
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.420]   straight from your browser.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.320]   All right, so speaking of which, let's get to some questions.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.760]   Our first one here is from K-pop crypto lover.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.560]   Oh no, I think we spoke too soon, Jesse.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.080]   We spoke too soon.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.320]   No, none of that.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.600]   These are newsletter subscribers.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.560]   They know what we're all about.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.080]   Our first question comes from Ryan.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   Ryan says, "I'm a university professor and a comic artist.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.160]   "I'm getting ready to launch my upcoming book
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.960]   "on Kickstarter on New Year's Day."
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.700]   All right, so that's a little bit of a reveal
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.880]   that this question was submitted a little while ago
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.440]   because we were recording this in March
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.340]   and he's talking about New Year's Day.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.380]   Moving on though.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.200]   Ryan says, "In an effort to get the word out,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   "I'm planning a big online tour
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.560]   "in which I'm talking with a different media outlet
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.980]   "every day of my month long campaign.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.820]   "My question is, I fear that I may be devoting
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.160]   "too much time to promoting the release
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.800]   "rather than finishing the book.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.940]   "My comic is almost complete, only two more pages to go,
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.160]   "but I'd really like to have it done by the launch.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.480]   "Any tips for prioritizing that deep cartooning work
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.040]   "in the face of trying to make a big noise
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.840]   "about my upcoming project?"
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.320]   Well, Ryan, it's a good question
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.720]   because I want you to be very wary
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.060]   of the publicity marketing.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:28.040]   It is an easy trap, a seductive trap
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.640]   for those that are producing commercial creative products
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.760]   to allow your energy to be increasingly drawn
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.040]   towards strategies for getting the word out.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.460]   Now, the reason why it's so seductive
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.240]   is because it presents a completely different
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.160]   type of challenge than actually producing creative output.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.240]   It's a challenge that is not trivial,
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.920]   but it's very tractable.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.640]   It's what I used to call checklist productivity,
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.440]   where you can go online and take an internet marketing
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.200]   course and follow some podcast of internet marketers
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.840]   and figure out a checklist, do this, this, this, and this,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.780]   and feel like you have some insider knowledge
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.240]   that the normal person won't do,
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.400]   but it's also consistently executable steps.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.300]   Make these calls, do this with your website,
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.360]   set up a funnel this way.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.480]   So it's very fulfilling.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.900]   It takes effort and it feels like it's insider information,
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.040]   but you know for a fact you can get it done.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.240]   Checklist productivity is incredibly seductive
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.640]   because there's never this moment of,
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.740]   "I'm just stuck.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.120]   "I'm trying to produce something new.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.460]   "I don't know if it's good or not.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.300]   "I could fail.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.460]   "I could produce something and it's bad.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.360]   "I couldn't have an idea."
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.860]   Checklist productivity, you can always get through.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.360]   Writers, cartoonists, artists get very seduced by this
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.520]   because, man, that's so much more appealing
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.080]   than actually producing writing or producing cartoons
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.840]   or producing art because it's tractable.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.880]   Check, check, check.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   You check off the check boxes as you go.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.200]   So I want you to be careful, Ryan,
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.720]   that you're not allowing your time
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.860]   to be increasingly consumed
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.580]   by these marketing publicity plans because it's fun,
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.660]   because it's better, it's easier,
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.720]   more fulfilling in the moment
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.680]   than actually trying to draw cartoons.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.080]   Now, it's not to say that stuff doesn't matter,
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.400]   but what I typically talk about
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.680]   is that when it comes to creative output,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.800]   the number one thing you have to do is be so good
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   you can't be ignored.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.600]   You have to produce stuff that is of really high quality.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.480]   You gotta do that.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.320]   That's the core.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.360]   Without that, with a few exceptions
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.040]   of internet influencer weirdness,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.200]   you're never gonna get somewhere that far.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.360]   That's where your attention has to be.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.320]   And then you want some sort
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.840]   of reasonable publicity marketing plan
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.700]   based on what you have available
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.180]   that helps try to spread the word,
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.440]   but if you don't have something to spread the word about,
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.280]   it doesn't matter.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.080]   You almost wanna confine the marketing publicity
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.480]   to like here are reasonable, tested things to do.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.720]   Here's when I'm gonna do this work.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.560]   I put it in a box.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.520]   I'll execute that.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.120]   It's a three-week period.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   But what I really care about is the production.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.640]   So in your case, I would say you need
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.100]   some cartoonish equivalent of the John McPhee method.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.040]   And by the John McPhee method,
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.660]   I'm referring to an essay I published
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.400]   on my blog and newsletter recently
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.460]   where I talked about on the occasion
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.740]   of John McPhee's birthday, his method of writing,
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.160]   which is 500 words a day.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.400]   And that's not a lot of words for a particular day,
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.620]   but as he says, you keep doing that
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.420]   and over time you're gonna produce quite a bit of work.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.180]   And he has 29 books, a Pulitzer,
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.340]   two National Book Awards nominations.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.540]   So you need whatever your equivalent is as a cartoonist
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.580]   is what I'd recommend of 500 words a day.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.420]   And the reason why I'm going
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.680]   for that tractable amount of words
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.100]   is because you're a university professor.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.420]   This is not the only thing you're doing.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.780]   And I would do it first thing in the morning.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.800]   And I don't know what that's gonna take for cartooning.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.980]   Is it a panel a day, three panels a day?
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.860]   I don't know the pacing,
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.420]   but basically like 60 to 90 minutes of work.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   And I would just make that an unviolatable core of your day.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.100]   You just do that every single day.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.800]   The marketing publicity stuff,
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.700]   that has to compete
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.740]   with all of your other university responsibilities.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.760]   You try to fit it in where you can
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.700]   and you have to use some weekend and evenings maybe.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.460]   Like that has to compete with your syllabuses
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.140]   and faculty meetings and everything else you're doing.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.740]   But the core is my 500 words a day.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.600]   My creative production at my creative peak,
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.480]   not a ton every day,
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.300]   but enough that you look back over a month,
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.460]   hey, I produced a good amount.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.420]   You look back over a year,
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.340]   you say, I'm very impressed by what I did.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.860]   You look back over a career and you say,
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.660]   I've been a pretty productive artist.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.100]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.500]   Go to this core of deep creative work
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.540]   that you don't violate.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.520]   The publicity marketing stuff,
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.980]   get that done as you can,
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.240]   have a plan, but keep it reasonable.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.380]   No one ever made themselves a long-term sustainable career
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.780]   as a respected creative,
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.860]   due solely or primarily to publicity.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.200]   It's always, always come down to producing stuff
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.660]   that people can't ignore.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.480]   The publicity marketing is all just about
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.220]   a delta on how long it takes people
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.420]   to actually discover it.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:00.680]   All right, so we have another question here from Mel.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.240]   Mel says, how do I get out of the urgent quadrant
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   for long enough to hire or outsource work
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.940]   and implement productivity systems?
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.340]   All right, so she elaborates,
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.820]   I manage my husband's medical practice.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.620]   I am burnt out and cognitively depleted
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.360]   by the volume time sensitivity
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.220]   and unrelenting nature of incoming work.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.340]   I spend all my time in the urgent quadrant
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.240]   and in hyperactive hive mind.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.920]   I don't have the option to leave the job.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.800]   I can hire and outsource to some extent
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.980]   when I'm able to make time for it,
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.400]   but how do I get out of the urgent quadrant
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.960]   for long enough to recruit and train staff
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.480]   and to implement sustainable productivity systems?
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.960]   Mel, I talk about exactly this problem in my book,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.320]   "A World Without Email."
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.080]   It is, I describe as a insidious negative feedback loop.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:49.940]   And here's what happens,
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.740]   and here's what's happening to you, but it's very common.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.300]   When you become too hyperactive
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.120]   with the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.000]   so that the sheer quantity of work
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.200]   that you're trying to organize
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.520]   in this very inefficient way with ad hoc,
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.220]   unscheduled back and forth messaging,
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.980]   when that gets to a certain point,
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.840]   you have so little breathing room,
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.760]   just trying to keep up
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.440]   with all these unscheduled back and forth messages,
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.220]   that there's no free time or energy
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.800]   to actually put in place the alternative systems
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.680]   that could reduce all of these unscheduled messages,
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.920]   these unscheduled ad hoc messages.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.680]   So when it gets too bad,
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.080]   you strip yourself of the time and energy required
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.180]   to make it better.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.160]   So it's an insidious negative feedback cycle.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.880]   And Mel, that's what you're in right now.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.160]   So what's the solution here?
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.180]   You have to temporarily, but drastically,
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.480]   give yourself some breathing room
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.800]   by dramatically reducing the amount of things
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.300]   that you're trying to coordinate in this inefficient manner.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.680]   So you do these drastic emergency reductions
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.940]   of what's on your plate.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.120]   That gives you breathing room to look at what remains
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.360]   and figure out sustainable systems.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.320]   It don't require you just constantly being on email,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.160]   constantly being on Slack, constantly checking your phone.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.620]   And then once these systems are in place,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.640]   then your breathing room gets much bigger
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.920]   because the things that remain have now been,
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.800]   from a cognitive perspective, made much more tractable.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.020]   You're able to add stuff back
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.020]   'cause now the systems are there.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.520]   But you have to pull things away
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.880]   and it's gonna feel painful.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.920]   It's gonna feel weird.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.560]   It's gonna feel like you're leaving money on the table.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.680]   You have to do that.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.920]   And then things come back
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.360]   once you have the actual systems in place.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.040]   Now, the added benefit of this approach
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.200]   is when you add things back,
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.220]   you maybe don't add back everything.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.640]   Maybe when you're trying to add things back,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.540]   you say this one type of business we do
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.480]   is not easily tameable by systems
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.720]   to get rid of unscheduled messages.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.080]   It's this particular client or type of work
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.040]   that requires and demands
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.200]   this berating constant communication.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.820]   And now it's really clear,
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.440]   well, that type of work is not compatible
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.400]   with the type of way we wanna work.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.320]   Let's not add it back.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.080]   Let's get rid of that type of business.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.000]   So it also gives you a chance to clean house
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.080]   as you're thinking about
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.040]   all the different type of business you do.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.440]   So what this means for your husband's medical practice,
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   for example, is cut back on clients, cut back on surgeries.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.760]   Like there's gonna be a period where you say,
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.220]   we're cutting back.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.200]   You're not stepping away from existing things,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.480]   but you're gonna put a hold
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.520]   on bringing on new things for a while.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.440]   You're gonna have a six-month period
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.340]   where you fall back towards a baseline
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.800]   and make less money and miss out opportunities,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.820]   but allows you to actually build in better systems,
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.520]   hire new staff, train that staff,
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   figure out how to make sure
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.060]   that you are not context shifting every two to three minutes,
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.160]   that you're not constantly in email,
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.640]   that you're not constantly on text messaging.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.480]   And here's the thing,
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.040]   who cares about six months worth of money?
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.880]   What's the point?
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.680]   That's a miserable existence you're talking about.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.240]   And your husband's probably burnt out too
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.440]   because he has too much work,
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.120]   it bleeds over to his practice.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.320]   That's the way you have to do it.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.460]   You have to make a dramatic temporary reduction
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.960]   if you're gonna get the breathing room required
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.280]   to build up systems that will be sustainable going forward.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.700]   The money will come back, but with much less stress
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.920]   once those systems are in place.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.480]   So that's what I recommend.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.760]   It's time, Mel, to do something radical.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:18.480]   All right, moving on here, we have a question from Orpheus.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   Appreciate the Greek mythology reference there.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.720]   How can you increase the intensity
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   of your deep work sessions
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.940]   if you're already focused and free of distractions?
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.700]   Orpheus goes on to say, I'm a music composer.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.640]   I can say, by the way, as an aside, I love,
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.800]   maybe this is why you chose the name,
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.760]   but obviously the character of Orpheus in Greek mythology
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.680]   is, has this beautiful singing voice
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.520]   and can write these, this beautiful music
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.880]   with which he woos Persephone.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.160]   So I like the fact that the person describing himself
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.840]   as Orpheus is a music composer, so well done, sir.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.180]   So anyways, Orpheus says, I'm a music composer
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.780]   who finds it takes me far too long to write music.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.680]   Following your book, "Deep Work," I have time blocked,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.420]   gotten away from distractions, set timers, and am focused.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.520]   Is there a way to continually increase intensity
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.000]   work produced in a certain timeframe
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   once all tenets of deep work are in place,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.800]   or should I just accept that this is a process
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.120]   that will always take a long time?
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.360]   All right, so Orpheus, I have three things to tell you,
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.560]   three additional things I want you to introduce.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.980]   One is ritual.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:34.200]   Where you do the work, what you do before the work occurs,
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.600]   especially for highly creative endeavors
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.320]   that require spontaneous creative production
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.640]   like music writing, music composing,
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.120]   this type of stuff matters,
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.640]   and it's probably worth investing money in.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.440]   You know, let me build out a space just for my composing,
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.880]   a special office I just go to, an outbuilding,
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.600]   or a really nice-looking building.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.200]   I remember at some point seeing the composing room
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.560]   that the movie composer, I believe it was James Horner,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.240]   used, and it was this over-the-top,
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.040]   decorated, really interesting room.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.180]   It matters for this type of thing.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.400]   What's your ritual before you write?
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.720]   When do you write? It's, you know,
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.160]   you walk through the forest,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.080]   you have a certain type of, you know,
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.000]   herb-a-mata tea just before you sit down.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.120]   There's a certain type of music playing
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.240]   on a vintage record player
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.960]   through really high-end speakers.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.080]   You want to lean on ritual for doing something
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.680]   that is as demanding as spontaneous creative production.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.080]   Don't think about this as wasting money.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.180]   Think about this as necessary investments
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.060]   to actually make creative work at this level,
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.080]   have a maximum chance of succeeding.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.280]   So that's my first suggestion.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.560]   My second is peers,
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.880]   by which I mean the people you spend time with.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.080]   Spend more time with people
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.880]   who do high-level creative work for their job.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.440]   Just being around people, artists and writers,
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.400]   other composers, other musicians
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.760]   that really take their work seriously
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.620]   and do it at a really high level,
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.820]   preferably at a level where you want to get.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.320]   It just affects the way that you approach it.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.040]   You're more likely to be locked in and focused
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.040]   because your mind adjusts to the norms
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.520]   and habits of those around you.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.400]   And when the norms and habits of those around you
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.320]   is very much focused on valuing of creative production,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.680]   your mind's going to be more on board
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   when you sit down at that piano and say, "Let's go for it."
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   So that could also help too.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.400]   So those are two things you might not have thought about.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.120]   The third is acceptance.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.360]   So after you've done those things and the other things,
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.760]   the time blocking and the timers
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.200]   and the training and everything else,
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   then just accept, "I'm doing creative work.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.700]   I've set the conditions to be as good as possible.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.080]   Where I end up at this point,
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.880]   this might just be what it feels like
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.520]   to do this creative work."
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.360]   You know, we sometimes create storylines
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.760]   about how it should feel.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.680]   We think like it should be the scene from "Amadeus"
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.360]   where Salieri has the entrance march
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.400]   and Mozart comes in and it's like, "Oh, I like that.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.560]   And can I try it?"
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.280]   And Salieri is like, "Do you want to see the music?"
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.040]   And Mozart says, "No, I think I got it."
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.000]   And he starts playing it from memory completely.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.240]   He's like, "Yeah, that's just it, right?"
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.600]   And then he stops for a second and says,
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.920]   "Wouldn't it be better if..."
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.160]   And he makes some changes and it becomes
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.240]   a beautiful, famous piece of Mozart music.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.560]   And Salieri is cursing the gods,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.440]   like how can he just do this in his head?
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.800]   Sometimes we think this is what creative work
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.640]   should feel like.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.400]   We have these storylines about we should sit at the piano
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.120]   and beautiful music just comes out
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   and everyone's really impressed.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.560]   And the Salieri's in our life are really jealous.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.360]   But that's often not what it's like.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.960]   Creative production is often painful.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.800]   So much of it happens in revision.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.280]   Now, I talked about last week, Brandon Sanderson
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.560]   and his process of writing super productively like he does.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.600]   But one of the things I picked up from the speech
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.960]   I watched of Brandon Sanderson
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.280]   talking about his writing process
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.920]   is how many revision processes go
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.160]   into actually getting one of his novels right.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.960]   So that means there's a whole part of his production
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.880]   where he's writing and it's painful and it's not very good.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.960]   But it's laying the foundation that's eventually
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.920]   on which he's gonna build a book that he is proud of.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.720]   So that's like my final point is acceptance.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.600]   If you're doing the stuff you're already doing
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.080]   and you add in the things I suggested
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.880]   you might be missing, ritual, peer group, alterations,
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:23.960]   doing the whole thing.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.360]   So now whatever it feels like,
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.680]   that's how it's supposed to feel.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.200]   And don't tell yourself stories
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.040]   that it should feel different.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.160]   That's probably what it's supposed to feel like.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.880]   Keep producing, keep being deep.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.480]   All right, we have a question here from Graham.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.400]   Graham says, how would you recommend
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.720]   structuring deep work sessions
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.360]   that require both reading and writing?
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.880]   For instance, would you find more value
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.400]   in reading an article or two and then writing
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.640]   or writing first to find out
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.280]   which articles you need to read?
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.200]   Well, Graham, the way I normally do this
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.360]   is write first, read second.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.960]   The reading is for the next day.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.440]   So I think the hard thing in writing
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.280]   is the actual writing itself.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.360]   That's where you should start.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.600]   You know, the first deep creative endeavor you do
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.800]   is the writing.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.520]   And then the reading can be later in the day
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.480]   because that's more flexible.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.240]   It can be over lunch break, you can read in the evening.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.320]   You know, you can sit by the fire, you can sit outside.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.040]   Like there's all sorts of different places you can read.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.280]   It's less cognitively demanding.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.320]   Give yourself more breathing room to have insights
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.160]   and to write things down.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.080]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.000]   Other people do it different.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.840]   Write first, read second.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.320]   And when you're reading, you're reading for writing
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.120]   that's gonna come in the future,
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.440]   not for the writing you're doing right then.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.920]   All right, so we have a few more questions I wanna do,
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.040]   but first I wanna talk about another sponsor
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.240]   that makes this podcast possible.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.440]   And that is our good friends at Grammarly.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.200]   Grammarly being one of the actual very first sponsors
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.720]   of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.080]   And for good reason, I think they align
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.360]   with a lot of what we're thinking here.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.880]   Now, here's the thing about Grammarly.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   It is not like those old fashioned grammar checkers
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.480]   that you remember from Word Perfect in the early 1990s
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.320]   where it can find a couple of common grammar mistakes.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.640]   Oh, you said it's with an apostrophe
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.800]   and you mean it's without it,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.960]   or you used the wrong form of there.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.280]   Grammarly today is an all-in-one writing tool
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.400]   that allows you to clearly
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.840]   and effectively communicate your ideas.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.120]   The type of things this tool can now do
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.880]   never fails to amaze me.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.240]   I mean, it makes us feel like we already live
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.760]   in the world of artificial intelligence and cyborgs
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.160]   because the power of the new Grammarly tool
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.840]   is something that I think is quite cool.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.640]   It can, for example, if you have their premium product,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.080]   Grammarly Premium, help you adjust your tone.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.560]   Here is the tone of your writing.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.200]   Here are some word changes that will adjust your tone
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.000]   to be closer to what you want.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.520]   It can help you do full sentence rewrites
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.280]   so that you can convey your ideas more clearly.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.680]   It'll give you clarity suggestions.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.800]   It'll give you a tone detector.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.880]   It'll look back at your writing and say,
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.800]   "Here is the tone this writing is coming across as."
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.760]   I've been playing around with Grammarly Premium
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.040]   because you can use it on almost any device,
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.120]   on almost any app where you're going to do writing.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.880]   And I am consistently amazed by how perceptive
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.320]   and precise its suggestions are.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.040]   And this type of thing matters because, look,
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.000]   we're in a world of communication, typed communication.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.680]   It's emails, it's Slack, it's blog posts.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.440]   There's so much we just write today.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.900]   We communicate through writing.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.760]   And all this stuff matters.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.240]   If your tone is good, your word choice is clear,
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.520]   it makes a huge difference compared
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.200]   to if it's not.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.560]   And having Grammarly Premium running on your devices
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.240]   and looking at the apps you do your writing
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.140]   is a way to make sure that you are ahead of the pack there.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.960]   Clear communication with the right tone, it really matters.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.160]   I have a whole chapter in my book, "A World Without Email"
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.000]   about how easy it is to misinterpret
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.880]   what people are trying to convey in written communication,
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.120]   how that's harder than we think and people think it's easy.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.480]   Grammarly Premium is a way to make sure
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.320]   that you don't fall into that trap.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   So get through those emails and your work quicker
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.960]   by keeping it concise, confident,
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.200]   and effective with Grammarly.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.220]   Go to grammarly.com/deep to sign up for a free account.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.000]   When you're ready to upgrade to Grammarly Premium,

[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:48.120]   So that's 25% off at g-r-a-m-m-a-r-l-y.com/deep.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.480]   I also wanna talk about Workable,
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.520]   a service that makes it much easier to hire people.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.120]   Now, Jesse, we've talked about before
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.360]   the ineffective method I used to hire you, right?
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.460]   Which involved me putting a net on the floor
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:13.400]   in Barnes & Noble near the business advice section,
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.240]   and then essentially cinching it up
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.160]   to capture and kidnap you.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.660]   Not a scalable solution.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.160]   If you want a scalable solution,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.160]   I would suggest going instead to our sponsor, Workable,
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.800]   which is gonna make that hiring a lot easier.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.520]   It helps you find the right candidates and hire them fast.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.840]   So one of the things it does,
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.480]   what is gonna help you,
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.180]   and this literally is their wording,
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.640]   cast the widest net possible.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.760]   And again, I have to caveat this,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.720]   they do not mean literally putting out a net
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.400]   to catch people, they mean it metaphorically here.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.900]   By posting your job to all of the top job boards,
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.360]   more than 200 total with just one click.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.800]   But what makes Workable really cool
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.120]   is not only does it make it really easy
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.720]   for you to post your job listing to all these places,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.160]   is that it then helps you on what happens next.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.840]   So it helps you evaluate and hire quickly
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.160]   with modern tools like video interviews and e-signatures.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.840]   It also has tools to help you automate repetitive tasks
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.460]   like scheduling interviews.
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.680]   So you can focus your time on actually talking to candidates
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.340]   and seeing who is right for your business,
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.480]   and not on the shallow logistical administrative work
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   that really makes hiring much harder than what realizes.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.280]   Like right now, Jesse, you're helping,
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.240]   we're hiring someone to help with some of the audio.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.080]   It's a pain, right?
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.040]   There's like a lot of admini...
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.680]   It's just, there's a lot more logistical
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.400]   and administrative back and forth, right?
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.680]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.840]   - And so if you're trying to do this for a lot of positions
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.960]   and you're hiring a lot of people,
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.360]   your day can get lost to the administrative details.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.320]   So Workable helps make that easy as well.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.180]   I mean, I have Jesse out there setting net traps
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.680]   all over the place to try to find this audio engineer.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.960]   I mean, we're hanging out next to like nightclubs
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.200]   and at conferences backed by the sound panels.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.320]   It's a pain to get all those nets set
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.640]   and to go see who we've captured.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.580]   We need Workable, Jesse.
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.240]   I think that's what I've learned.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.240]   We need to stop spending most of our ad budget on nets
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.360]   and instead get Workable.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.240]   - Yeah, the nets take up a lot of space too.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.040]   - Yeah, we have a whole room full of nets.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.300]   So Workable is our future.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.280]   So anyways, start hiring today
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.300]   with a risk-free 15 day trial.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.080]   And if you hire during this trial, which many do,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:25.920]   it won't cost you a thing.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.660]   So it's not gonna charge you if during the free trial,
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.140]   you end up hiring someone.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:34.140]   So go to workable.com/podcast to try it out for free
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:37.640]   for 15 days starting today.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.740]   Workable is hiring made easy.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.040]   I don't know, one day we're gonna look up
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.360]   and have no sponsors left, Jesse.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.460]   - We gotta tighten up the ship here.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.340]   We can't tell them about our nets.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.400]   Oh, well, we tried.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.280]   Let's do a few more questions here.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.820]   I have one from Katie.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:03.880]   Katie says, "I know thinking deep is a thought
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.320]   or work process of younger adults,
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.220]   but how about addressing the older population?
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:12.500]   Retirees like myself have lots of time on their hands.
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.480]   And really, after you've worked so long in one profession,
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.300]   you don't know what to do with so much time.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.300]   I'd like to learn Spanish or be more productive,
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.060]   but who knows in what, who knows in what?
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.100]   And how does deep thinking become a process in our life?"
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.700]   Well, Katie, earlier in this show,
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.380]   we did this question a few times.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.380]   And what I would often come back to is for people
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.540]   who are later in life, who are retiring or have retired,
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:42.100]   the deep life bucket method becomes very important.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:48.540]   Now go watch my video on the deep life core idea,
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.140]   youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.620]   Watch that video to get brought up to speed
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.560]   on what the deep life bucket method is.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.720]   But there is fewer circumstances
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:59.260]   where this method is more effective
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.560]   than for people who are retired.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.760]   Because what it's gonna force you to do
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.480]   is look at the different elements of your life
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.400]   that are important.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.280]   And then for each of those,
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   get rid of the noise and boost the signal.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.600]   Get rid of the junk that's not returning you much
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.160]   and put in place habits and endeavors
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.360]   that are really giving you a high return on time investment.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.200]   Now, when you're retired,
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.680]   you have a lot more time to invest.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.740]   So this process becomes more exciting.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.560]   But the bucket method where you're breaking up your life
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:27.120]   into these different parts prevents you from having capture
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.780]   in just one element of your life,
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.520]   or from getting too lost in minutia.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.440]   It gives you some structure to this whole process.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.700]   So I think it's one of the exciting things about retirement
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.560]   is you can re-engineer your life in the systematic way,
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.800]   and you have so much more levers to pull
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.440]   and knobs to turn than say someone who is up to their ears
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.080]   midlife at a peak of their career trajectory,
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.320]   which is eating up all their time,
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.680]   and every minute that remains is wrangling kids.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.140]   I mean, you now have the promised land, Katie,
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.960]   which is some room to actually do some cool things
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.800]   with your life.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.360]   So go listen to that.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.200]   Watch that video.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.020]   I'd say not listen,
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.080]   but watch that video on the deep life.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.880]   The bucket method will help organize
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.340]   your efforts going forward.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.540]   All right, so we have another question here
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:13.380]   speaking of careers.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:14.720]   This one is from Jeff.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.100]   Jeff says, "Hi, Cal.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.600]   Earlier this year, you were talking about
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.060]   how the principles of your book,
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.780]   'So Good They Can't Ignore You'
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.360]   don't really apply to lawyers
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.380]   because the more career capital they get,
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.060]   the more work they get,
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.940]   which leads to less freedom and less autonomy.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.900]   My question is what should we lawyers in the audience do?"
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:41.900]   And he goes on to say that he is a six-year associate.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:48.620]   Well, Jeff, what you can do is leave the big law firm job.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:52.980]   And not to be stark about it,
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.840]   but career capital theory is pretty clear.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.160]   You build leverage by doing rare and valuable things,
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.460]   but that's only really useful
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.500]   if you can then apply that leverage
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.900]   to shape your career towards things that resonate
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.060]   and away from things that don't.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.640]   Big city law firm jobs,
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.180]   where you work your way up the associate ladder,
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.220]   you're a six-year associate,
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.020]   which means you're about to go up for partnership.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.040]   And then after partnership,
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.360]   you go up for equity partnership.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.260]   And then you work up a ladder of equity partnership
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:21.020]   until the very highest you could possibly get
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.320]   is named a partner.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.820]   And the money goes up with each of those levels.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:30.060]   And the money is good if you're in DC,
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.460]   let's say, big city with one of these big firms.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.540]   These numbers really vary,
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.180]   but we're talking about you're starting
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.540]   as a younger associate,
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.860]   you're already at three or $400,000 a year.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:41.780]   As a junior partner,
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:45.940]   you're probably talking six, 700,000.
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:49.140]   Equity partner, you're gonna break at a big firm,
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.300]   you got like a Skaggan,
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.300]   you're gonna break a Wilmer,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.060]   you'll break seven figures.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.220]   And then these more senior equity partners
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.580]   in a big city, the big firm,
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:00.780]   one five, one six, something like that.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.340]   So like you make a lot of money,
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.620]   but it's incredibly time demanding.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.140]   And it demands more and more of your time.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.540]   There's almost nothing you can invest your career capital
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.220]   in other than getting more money
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.460]   and maybe some influence on what your practice is.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.260]   You can kind of carve out your own practices,
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.440]   but you're not gonna get more autonomy.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.980]   The other buckets, the non-craft buckets of the deep life,
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.000]   you're gonna have a really hard time doing much of anything
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:22.940]   in any of those buckets
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.740]   if you're gonna work up that ladder.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.180]   Now, for some, I don't know,
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.660]   they value the money, they value the prestige.
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.120]   For some, it's this money is going to allow a lifestyle
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.300]   that's good for the rest of my family
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.020]   and that's my contribution and that's fine.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.420]   But if it's not fine for you,
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.300]   if you feel overwhelmed by work,
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.380]   if it's stressing you out, it's making you anxious,
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.380]   you feel hemmed in, you feel miserable.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.940]   And a lot of lawyers do in those situations.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:50.500]   The answer is to leave the big law firm.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.340]   Do something else with your law degree.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.860]   And it'll be a lot less money, but so what?
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:00.420]   I don't know, what's the good of the one six
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.480]   if you only have six hours a week
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.560]   that you're seeing your family, right?
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.080]   So I usually am pretty radical about that.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.200]   You have to go into a big firm law career
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.040]   with your eyes open.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.960]   This is what it's gonna be and it's not gonna get better.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.200]   And so many people stumble into it
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.020]   because it's just, this is the next step up,
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.760]   this is more prestigious than this.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.160]   And it's not that there's not value
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.560]   in doing something competitive, there is.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.800]   And it's not that it will make you feel better
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.620]   because it does.
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:24.800]   And it's not that you don't get pride
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.800]   out of having such a hard elite job, you should.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.320]   It's very difficult to give you someone
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.200]   to pay you seven figures for anything, right?
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.180]   That's hard to do.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.480]   And there is some pride there,
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.760]   but if it is making you miserable, there's no way.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.560]   There's no way to reconfigure your job
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.420]   at a big law firm that's gonna get rid of that misery.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.420]   So I just like to put that option on the table
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.400]   of the proverbial big city lawyers.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.200]   Know what you're getting into.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.220]   And if that's not working, I can't give you a way out
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.640]   that's gonna preserve that salary,
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.880]   that's gonna preserve the house in Chevy Chase
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.760]   and the private school in the second house on the beach.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.580]   I can't give you a way out
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.560]   that's gonna preserve all of that.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.400]   It's gonna be a pretty radical lifestyle change,
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.500]   a different type of law, something your own firm,
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.900]   something that you can control
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.760]   how many clients you take on or off.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.400]   And that's basically what you're gonna have to do, Jeff.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.680]   So look, this is probably the time to think about that
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.880]   before you go up for partnership.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.220]   I hope I'm not the bearer of bad news,
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.200]   but I just think it's important to be clear.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.680]   This is the reality of that job.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.040]   And let's not pretend like it's not
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.540]   or like it's gonna be different somehow,
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.840]   different somehow for you.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.180]   You know, Jesse, I went down,
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.760]   the reason why I had those salary numbers on hand
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.160]   is for some reason I went down a rabbit hole
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.320]   of lawyer compensation,
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:38.480]   because I know a lot of lawyers who are very stressed out
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.240]   and I was trying to compare, I was like,
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.040]   well, how much like do I make as a writer
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.040]   versus what they're doing
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.800]   and how much more flexible is my job?
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.960]   And I went down this rabbit hole
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.440]   and you can like find a lot of these numbers.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:51.560]   It's a big topic of discussion in the DC area.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.540]   But I never know,
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.360]   I never know how people think about those jobs.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.520]   Like when you hear those numbers, those salary numbers,
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.780]   did that surprise you as more than you thought,
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.740]   less than you thought
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.740]   or about what you would have thought
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.340]   lawyers were making around here?
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.820]   - About what I thought, I would say.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.460]   - I find that people who live in the cities,
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.900]   like, yeah, that's what I'd expect.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.140]   And people who don't, like what?
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.740]   You get a million dollars a year
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.480]   to be a junior equity partner, what is that?
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.100]   - Yeah, it's also a weird perspective for me
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:22.940]   'cause I have a couple,
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.140]   like a few like really good friends
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.420]   who kill it on the internet.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.060]   So then you, when I see those numbers,
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.220]   I mean, I'm nothing like any of that,
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.940]   but I see those numbers and I'm like, that's nothing.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.260]   - Here's the hierarchy,
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:39.140]   the elite job hierarchy in terms of salaries, right?
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:44.140]   So you have lawyers and like investment bankers,
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.920]   lawyers at big firms and investment bankers
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.340]   for firms like Goldman, right?
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.740]   So lawyers, you hit seven figures
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.560]   when you get to the partner level,
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.840]   again, big firm, big company.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.000]   If you're at something like Goldman Sachs,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.040]   when you get to the managing director level,
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.440]   you're gonna hit seven figures plus with bonuses, right?
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.180]   So that's, and the elite jobs,
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.040]   actually this is gonna be at the bottom of our platform.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.480]   Then the next thing you have above that is,
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.600]   all right, so then the more elite jobs are,
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.000]   I'm trying to see how I order this.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.780]   I guess I would order it next,
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.240]   maybe like venture capitalists.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.680]   If you had a really big venture capital firm
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.000]   where you can get a cut of the returns,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.920]   now you can jump above that low seven figures
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.840]   and get that good healthy mid seven figure type payouts.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   And then you have this big leap
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.400]   where you get to the tech sector, like your friends.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   And in the tech sector,
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.600]   because you can have businesses that are bought,
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.560]   that's where you start to get eight figure
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.440]   or low nine figure paydays.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.660]   So now it's okay, I've started a tech company
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.480]   and I netted 30 million in the sale.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.840]   So now we're at that like eight figure level.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.280]   And then the people who lord over it all
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   is the hedge fund managers.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.040]   'Cause now when you're a hedge fund manager,
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.600]   they laugh at everyone else
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   because they can do eight or nine figure income
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.980]   every single year,
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.860]   because they're getting their carry cost
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.280]   of these really big hedge funds.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.920]   And so then they look at the tech people and say like,
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.160]   look, you're laughing at the Goldman guy
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.280]   who makes one five a year
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.240]   because you sold your company for 30 million.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.200]   So that took you five years
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.600]   to sell your company for 30 million.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.960]   And I pull in 150 million a year every year for my hedge fund
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   and then the very top hedge fund people
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.380]   will bring in a billion dollars a year plus.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.800]   So there's your hierarchy of like crazy amounts of money
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.860]   that elite jobs.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:41.820]   Notice nowhere in that hierarchy that I say,
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.000]   author podcasters,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.720]   they don't land, we don't land on that hierarchy,
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.120]   unfortunately,
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.160]   professor podcasters don't land on that hierarchy.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.320]   But that's a whole interesting world,
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.760]   like the super big money job world.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.880]   CEOs are in there too.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.880]   CEOs of big companies land like where the tech people are,
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   seven, eight figure salaries.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.800]   - Have you seen the new show on Showtime,
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.280]   super pumped or read the book?
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.920]   - It's about Uber?
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.880]   - Yeah.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.240]   It's about Travis Kalanick.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.000]   There's a episode two just was released this week
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   and there's a good scene in there
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.640]   where the VC brings him to the airfield
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.760]   where there's all the private jets.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.960]   And he's like, what do you need to say to me?
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.840]   He goes, are we going somewhere?
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.320]   And then he was like, so-and-so.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.560]   And then Travis is pretty brash, pretty confident guy.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.040]   And he was like,
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.640]   I started to have a couple of lines about like Elon Musk
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.840]   and Bezos and stuff like owning like 40 of those planes.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.120]   And like, what do you really want to do?
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.600]   - What I really want to do is own all of those planes.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.760]   - Not go on that jets.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.840]   - Yeah.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.200]   Oh my God.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.640]   We're getting there.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.880]   We have a couple more steps
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.720]   before we're buying the Deep Questions private plane.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.960]   Like, so we are-
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.440]   - You gotta get it before the 200th episode
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.240]   so we can go to South Africa.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.000]   - To go to that, yeah, for that main episode.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.720]   Yeah, so we're almost there.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.160]   We want to get like a boom arm for our computer monitor
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.000]   so we can move it.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.240]   So that's first.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:16.360]   I want to get longer cables for our video switcher
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.200]   so that when we have guests,
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.680]   we can bring the video switcher
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.920]   so you can switch video for us.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.000]   That's two.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.320]   So boom arm for the computer monitor.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.640]   That's number one.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.320]   Longer cables for the video switcher.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.280]   That's number two.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.240]   Private jet.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.520]   That's number three.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.000]   Number four, I'm thinking we should have our own coffee maker
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.800]   because, you know, we buy a lot of coffee.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.960]   And so those are the things we're working on.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.640]   I think with that sweet workable money
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.280]   and grammarly money,
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.840]   we'll have that private jet
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.280]   right after we get those longer cables.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.720]   Oh, that's depressing thinking about big money people.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.560]   But I got to say,
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.920]   those people must all be incredibly stressed out.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.760]   Right?
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.600]   That's all stressed out.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:01.000]   I think the sweet spot I still think is genre novelist.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:01.840]   Right?
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.200]   So you produce one thing a year,
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.360]   but you don't have to win book.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360]   It doesn't have to be literature
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.040]   because there's too much stress if you're a literary novelist
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.240]   because you live and die by the reviews.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.120]   But no, you're writing like a Jack Reacher book.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.480]   It doesn't have to be literature.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.720]   You have your formula, one book a year.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.880]   No one expects you to do anything else.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.200]   They don't, you know,
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.840]   Lee Child doesn't have a big social media presence.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.680]   He doesn't podcast.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.520]   You just have to write a book.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.480]   They don't expect you to do anything else
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.080]   because people are just used to buying your book.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.440]   You make a good amount of money.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.440]   Like Lee Child,
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.280]   he bought the apartment above their apartment for writing.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.520]   So he could get there pretty quickly,
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.760]   but it's not, you know, Travis was his name money.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.240]   He's not flying around in private jets.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.080]   And, but they, you know,
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.040]   they have like a writing house by the beach
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.720]   and they're very little is expected from them.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.800]   That's the sweet spot.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.760]   Like you have a lot of money,
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.040]   but not a crazy amount of money,
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.200]   but it's the money to anxiety ratio.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.840]   I think that's gotta be the,
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.520]   if we put the other way, anxiety, the money ratio,
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.760]   that must be the lowest anxiety,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.440]   the money ratio you can find, in my opinion,
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.480]   is successful genre novelist that produces one novel a year
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.200]   in a successful series.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.280]   That's the sweet spot.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.160]   - Like it.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.560]   - Yeah. So I gotta start writing.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.520]   So I'm gonna announce my new detective series
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.400]   about a suave computer scientist
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.760]   who by day solves theorems
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:22.040]   and by night fights international terrorist rings.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.680]   Well, you know, fighting off the women
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.840]   who fall in love with them.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.280]   - And then when you do the audio version,
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.000]   you need to have some character in there
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.720]   with the voice that you used last week.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.560]   That was classic.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.960]   - You know, that French character.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.560]   Yeah, that French character will be in there.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.960]   You know, we got a note from Tim Ferriss,
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.360]   his chief of staff, who like runs all this podcast.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.200]   And he sent us a note saying
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.880]   that he really appreciated the accent.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.560]   - Oh, it was great. I was dying.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.040]   - So that character will be in there.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.440]   And the character will obviously be me.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:51.040]   Like we'll call him like, you know, Kevin Newhouse,
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.920]   but like, it'll clearly be me, you know,
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.880]   but I'm gonna have David Goggins voice him.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.720]   So he's gonna have this like really like aggressive,
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.640]   deep, awesome voice.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.200]   And the audio books are gonna have
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.760]   a lot of musical interludes,
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.760]   like action musical interludes while I fight.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.880]   And then I'll buy the house next to mine
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.800]   to be a writing house.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.760]   And well, there we go.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.080]   So it's all mapped out.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.160]   - Oh man. All right.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.640]   Nonsense. It's all nonsense.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.040]   All right. Let's try to do two quick ones
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.600]   because I know we're running a little late here.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.640]   All right. We got one here from Jeff.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.520]   Jeff says, "Does context switching
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.080]   affect reading comprehension?"
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.600]   Yeah, it does.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.320]   If you're trying to read a book,
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.800]   but you keep initiating context shifts,
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.480]   like you have to keep checking your text messages
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.160]   because there's like a conversation going on
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.520]   or you keep checking your inboxes.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.880]   Or if you're like me the last few days,
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.720]   you're constantly checking updates
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.520]   on the baseball collective bargaining agreement
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.880]   coming together.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.480]   You're gonna remember much less from the book.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.800]   Your mind is gonna have unrelated networks
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.400]   that are activated and some relevant networks inhibited.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.960]   You won't understand that as well.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.800]   So if you're reading something you care about, just read.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.240]   And if you wanna communicate, go off and communicate.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.520]   Separate those two things.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.160]   All right. One more question.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.880]   Matt says, "What do you think of the critique
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.840]   of hyperlinks expressed in the writings of Nicholas Carr?"
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.480]   Well, Matt, I think that critique quickly aged.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.840]   It quickly aged and the specific content of that critique
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.360]   is not that relevant,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.040]   but the spirit of that critique is really relevant.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.840]   So just briefly, I think Matt is talking about the book,
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.400]   "The Shallows" by Nicholas Carr, which is now pretty old.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.040]   It's from the first decade of the 2000s.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.520]   And it was one of the first books to look at the impact
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.000]   of content consumption online
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.040]   on our ability to think deeply or think clearly.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.560]   And back then, the studies he was citing
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.840]   had to do with the impact of comprehension
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.920]   of reading websites that have hyperlinks
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.640]   because you read for a little bit
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.840]   and then you follow a hyperlink
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   and you follow that hyperlink
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.000]   as opposed to linearly consuming information
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.720]   as carefully structured and written by the author.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.400]   Now, it's less relevant today
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.000]   because people don't read long articles
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.920]   with hyperlinks anymore.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.200]   The technology went past that.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.080]   That's an out of date technology,
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.800]   but things are even worse.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.360]   So instead of now making it easy for you to escape
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.560]   from a carefully structured piece of long form content,
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.960]   we just got rid of the carefully structured
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.360]   long form content.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.200]   And we just read 250 characters for Twitter
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.840]   or captions on Instagram,
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.400]   or we shortened that down to memes.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.640]   Let's just have a picture with a couple of sentences on it
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.400]   or videos that are incredibly tightly edited,
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.880]   boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.120]   And so we got rid of the option
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.000]   of even not following rabbit holes
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.840]   by just making everything just quick rabbit holes.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.920]   And I'm sure that is amplifying the issues
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.040]   Carr talked about, reducing attention,
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.240]   reducing the comfort when it does come time
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   to read something like a book,
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.760]   reducing our comfort with doing that,
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.000]   our mind wanders, we can't sustain attention.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   So yes, the hyperlink critique quickly got aged,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.680]   but the underlying spirit of the medium
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.280]   of internet communication,
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.440]   pushing us towards a more fragmented mind,
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.360]   those issues have amplified to a point
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.400]   that I think even Carr wouldn't have predicted
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.760]   in his most pessimistic moments
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.320]   back when he was writing that book.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.040]   All right, well, that's all the time we have for today.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.000]   Thank you everyone who sent in their questions.
