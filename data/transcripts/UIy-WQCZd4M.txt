[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.820]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.940]   Today's episode marks the fourth in the six-episode series
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.080]   on fitness, exercise, and performance.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.440]   And today's episode is all about optimal fitness programming
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.500]   that is how to design a fitness and exercise program
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.720]   that can achieve the goals that you want
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   for fitness and for sports performance.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.040]   Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.220]   In previous episodes, you taught us
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.440]   about the various adaptations that occur
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.760]   at the level of cells, at the level of organs,
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.800]   indeed at the level of the entire body,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.200]   that underlie things like improvements in strength
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.880]   and speed, hypertrophy, aka muscle growth,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.080]   and the various forms of endurance.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.340]   And you laid out beautifully the various protocols
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.400]   that one can do in order to achieve
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.400]   each and every one of those adaptations.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.120]   Today, I'd love for you to teach us
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.320]   how we can combine different protocols
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.900]   to achieve multiple adaptations in parallel.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.200]   For instance, how to improve endurance and strength,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.180]   how to achieve some level of hypertrophy,
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.960]   perhaps directed hypertrophy at specific muscle groups,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480]   while also maintaining endurance
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.780]   and perhaps improving speed, for instance.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.160]   And if you would, I'd love for you to tell us
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.800]   how we can combine different protocols
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.000]   and vary those across the week, across the month,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.400]   across the year, so that we can make regular progress.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.100]   And perhaps even you could give us a window
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.800]   into the ways to make the fastest progress possible.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.920]   - Yeah, I would love to do that.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.840]   You know, we've invested a lot of time
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.160]   in the previous episodes covering background
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.540]   and concepts and detail about the physiology
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.880]   so you understood why you're making the choices
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.320]   you're making and why other choices are less effective.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   In this discussion, I would actually like to jump
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.600]   maybe more directly to the answer
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.560]   and kind of get right into the protocol.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.100]   So maybe a little bit less background.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.400]   If you're interested in that stuff,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.560]   I suppose you have to go backwards a little bit
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.840]   and watch some of those previous episodes.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.640]   But I would love to jump into just some samples,
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.980]   some case studies, if you will,
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.640]   and kind of walk through different protocols.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.760]   I know that over the course of my 11 years
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.280]   as a college professor and being in the public space
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.720]   a little bit, probably the most numerous style of question
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.520]   I have gotten is exactly that.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.920]   So I know the rep range for this,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.320]   or I know the style of training for that adaptation.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.880]   But how do I put them together?
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.440]   And I would just like to spend our time today
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.700]   going through those things.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.800]   And the reason I wanna do it is this.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.260]   Some people listening at home surely just love exercise.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.160]   They're already bought in
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.560]   and they're gonna train no matter what.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.800]   And they're interested in just actually being more effective.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.320]   And so the way that you structure
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.440]   and put your plan together will in large part
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.320]   determine getting more progress for less effort,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320]   or actually being able to put the same amount of effort
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.320]   in and getting results faster.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.800]   There's also some folks probably listening who are like,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.680]   "Okay, I exercise, I do what I can.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.280]   "I'm bought into the benefits."
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.760]   So you've talked so elaborately
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.280]   over the hundred plus episodes you've done
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.160]   about the various benefits of exercise.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.920]   But you're kind of doing it
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.260]   because you know it's important, but you're not there.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260]   So for those folks, it's sort of like,
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.200]   "Okay, how can we actually make this thing more effective?"
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.660]   So we can make sure you hit the things
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.700]   you absolutely have to get
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.200]   for the short and long-term benefits,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.680]   to make sure that you're looking the way you wanna look,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.940]   you're performing physically the way you wanna perform,
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.160]   and that you can do that across your lifespan.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.860]   So how can we give you all some structure
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.760]   to where, again, you don't have to turn into
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   an absolute lover of physical fitness
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.220]   and it doesn't have to take over your life,
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.200]   but you can still get more results
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.280]   for your same time restrictions,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.000]   whether that be you have two days a week
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.960]   or five days a week or only certain access
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.660]   to equipment or experience, whatever the case may be.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.400]   How can we help those folks as well put together a protocol
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.280]   that will get them closer to their goals
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   with less restrictions?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.940]   - Fantastic, and I'm hoping that along the way,
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.680]   you'll also point us to how often
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.760]   to take the fitness assessment for each of the adaptations
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   that you referred to in a previous episode.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.040]   We will also link to that fitness assessment segment
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.980]   in the show note captions for this episode,
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.920]   because that fitness assessment for different adaptations,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.340]   I think is a really powerful way for people to touch in
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.580]   and see how much long endurance do they have?
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.420]   How much anaerobic capacity do they have?
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.340]   How much strength do they really have?
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.040]   And then perhaps you'd also be willing
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.200]   to throw in a couple of additional ways
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.440]   that we can assess our level of fitness and progress
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.760]   in this arc of a fitness program across the year.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.720]   - Amazing, I can't wait to do that.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.500]   I think it is also important before we jump in
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.800]   to acknowledge a lot of folks maybe thinking themselves,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.660]   I don't really necessarily need a plan.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.560]   Why do I have to do that?
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.400]   I don't have a certain goal I'm going after.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.140]   I'm not running a race anytime soon.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.680]   I'm not a competitive athlete.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.200]   I go to the gym and I work out, and that's great.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.720]   Well, I would like to try to convince you
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.080]   that regardless of where you're at,
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.400]   having a plan will achieve those things we just talked about
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.340]   which is more success in a shorter timeframe.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.420]   There's actually a significant amount of research
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.600]   to support this.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.360]   Those individuals who go on a specific training plan
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.900]   compared to those who do not will receive better results
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.480]   independent of the effectiveness of the program.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.280]   So we've talked in previous episodes
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.460]   about tons of different styles and strategies.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.860]   And to reiterate, it really doesn't matter
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.460]   which one you pick.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.660]   The fact that you have a plan is always more effective
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.280]   than not having a plan.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.720]   And so again, even if you're not planning
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.300]   on competing with something,
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.040]   if you wanna shorten the amount of time you're in the gym,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.960]   get more results from it,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.000]   I would strongly encourage to put something together.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.380]   The two largest reasons why people don't get results
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.620]   with their fitness training protocol
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.400]   is number one, adherence.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.860]   And then number two, some sort of progressive overload.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.400]   Both of those two things are challenging to accomplish
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.960]   without a plan, right?
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.480]   So the reason people don't go to the gym, one of them,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.440]   and one of the reasons why it takes them so long
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.160]   is 'cause they don't walk in with a very specific plan.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.960]   It's sort of like going to the grocery store
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.040]   and figuring out what you're going to buy
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.820]   versus knowing exactly what you're gonna get
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.120]   in your shopping list, grabbing those things,
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.960]   and getting out.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.860]   You'll notice your time in the grocery store
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.160]   is half the length.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.920]   You're more productive and you didn't waste money
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.380]   on extra things, okay?
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.800]   So that alone will drive adherence
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.160]   because you're now going to think to yourself,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.800]   oh, that 90-minute workout I do is actually really just 60.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.200]   And so now the next time you go to training,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.100]   you're like, man, I don't have 90 minutes.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.400]   You realize it's only 60, or 40, or 30, or 20.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.460]   Whatever it needs to be.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.780]   So that alone will get you there.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.620]   The second part of that, which is overload.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.500]   It's very difficult to understand and remember,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.360]   well, the last time I did lat raises,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.960]   I used, I think, five pounds,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.640]   and then I think I did like 12.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.480]   Well, if you don't have some sort of system of tracking,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.080]   and this can be as simple as a notebook,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.040]   just writing down what you did before
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.520]   and doing a little bit more the next time.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.080]   That is going to almost guarantee you success.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.620]   So having some structure,
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.140]   and this structure can be fairly loose.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.820]   We're going to talk about a bunch of different examples,
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.460]   is something I strongly encourage everyone
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.420]   to utilize for their exercise.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.100]   - Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.340]   that this podcast is separate
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.540]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.460]   It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin's
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.100]   teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.120]   It is, however, part of our desire and effort
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.940]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.800]   about science and science-related tools
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.080]   to the general public.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.180]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.720]   we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   Our first sponsor is Momentus.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.040]   Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.320]   The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.640]   with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.760]   First of all, as I mentioned,
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.720]   their supplements are of extremely high quality.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.440]   Second of all, their supplements are generally
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.480]   in single ingredient formulations.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.920]   If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol,
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.360]   you're going to want to focus mainly
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.480]   on using single ingredient formulations.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.240]   With single ingredient formulations,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.560]   you can devise the most logical and effective
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.020]   and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.340]   In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.320]   And this is, of course, important because we realized
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   that many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   reside outside the United States.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.220]   If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.720]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.080]   in particular supplements for hormone health,
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.200]   for sleep optimization, for focus,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.400]   as well as a number of other things,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.040]   including exercise recovery,
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.160]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.840]   so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.720]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.380]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.000]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.880]   I've been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.440]   for about the last eight months,
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.780]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.560]   I'm sleeping about the same amount,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.920]   but I'm sleeping far deeper,
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   and I'm now getting the proper ratios
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.960]   of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep,
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.560]   and slow wave sleep, and waking up feeling far more
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.480]   recovered mentally and physically.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   The underlying mechanism for all that
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.600]   is very straightforward.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.460]   I've talked many times before on this podcast,
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.520]   and elsewhere, about the critical relationship
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.800]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.700]   That is, in order to fall asleep at night,
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.140]   your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.560]   in terms of core body temperature,
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.660]   and waking up involves a one to three degree increase
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.960]   in core body temperature.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.580]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.140]   you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.600]   to be one temperature at the start of the night,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.400]   a different temperature the middle of the night,
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.520]   and a different temperature as you approach morning,
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.080]   each of which can place you into the optimal stages
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.960]   of sleep, and have you waking up feeling more refreshed
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.840]   than ever.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.060]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.440]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman,
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.080]   and check out their pod three cover,
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.380]   and save $150 at checkout.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.860]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.460]   United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.660]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.940]   to save $150 at checkout.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.480]   So what sorts of things should people be thinking about
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.880]   when developing an overall fitness program?
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.500]   - A few minutes ago, we were talking about
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.200]   how two of the major reasons people don't get as much
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.400]   out of their training programs as they would like
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.780]   is because of one, a lack of adherence,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.440]   and two, a lack of progressive overload.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.380]   So the solution to that is constructing a plan
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.440]   that lives within your realistic limitations.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.220]   So I would like to walk you through my 10 step approach
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.320]   to how I design training programs.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.800]   Now before I do that, I think it is fair and important
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.480]   for the audience to understand that
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.640]   this is simply my approach.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.280]   I've been doing this a long time.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.800]   I played college football,
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.320]   and I wrote my own training programs back then.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.880]   I have and am still working with professional athletes
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.440]   in PGA Tour, in the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball,
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.780]   as well as a ton of general population folks.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.460]   So this is a combination of the evidence base
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.960]   that we've been talking about in terms of best practices
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.860]   for strength and conditioning,
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.000]   as well as just my years of experience.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.900]   So there are many, many ways one could do this.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.860]   I'm not even suggesting this is the best.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.720]   This is simply how I do it.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.320]   This is exactly how I handle it
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.860]   when a new individual comes to me
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.900]   and how I teach my students.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.280]   So step number one is assessing properly
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.100]   and identifying a training goal.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.540]   Now that's actually sort of funny
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.560]   because we hear that a lot,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.740]   but a lot of people actually never take that step.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.940]   Not to call anybody in the room out.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.160]   - What's happening here is this morning,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.840]   Andy, Dr. Galpin and I were training together,
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.360]   and he was providing amazing tips on form
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.920]   and set rep cadence and this sort of thing.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.040]   And he said, "So what's your training goal
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.940]   "for the next 12 months?"
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.980]   And I paused and it turned into a very long pause.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.400]   - Which is an easy, nice way of saying
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.360]   he didn't have an answer.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.660]   - I didn't have an answer.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.900]   Of course, I don't just want to maintain
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.360]   what I've developed in terms of strength
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.200]   and hypertrophy and endurance,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.360]   but I don't have a clear goal.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.880]   So I'm hoping that by the end of today's discussion,
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.340]   I will be on track to a clear set of goals.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.180]   - Amazing.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.320]   I'm not going to bore you all here,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.820]   but really I can't stress enough
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.920]   how important that step really truly is to getting results.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.760]   The analogy we use here is if you left your house
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.440]   and you were attempting to get to the grocery store
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.720]   and you just started driving,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.600]   and if you drove every possible road,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.720]   you would eventually get to a grocery store.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.920]   And so yes, that can work.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.980]   A better approach is saying here's where I am,
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.460]   there's where I want to go.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.880]   What is the optimal route there?
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.560]   And that's really what you're doing with goals.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.700]   So it is a boring step.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.880]   It is not interesting to hear.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.840]   I don't have any real hacks or tricks for you,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.400]   but it is step number one on purpose.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.040]   We have to know exactly where we're going.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.760]   You can do this in two ways.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.960]   Way number one is to just pick something,
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.300]   arbitrarily decide I'm going to run a 5K,
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.640]   or I've done that before
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.360]   and I want to improve it by 10 seconds.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.840]   I want to lose 10 pounds.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.060]   You can just pick one, that's great.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.960]   Another way is to run through that fitness testing protocol
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.760]   we described a few episodes before.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.240]   And if you do that, you can see which of these areas
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.320]   that maybe you have the largest lagging in
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.260]   or what is the most severe performance anchor
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.840]   is how we refer to it.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.720]   And then choose that as your primary goal.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.100]   So either option, some people come into training programs
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.540]   with a very clear goal in mind,
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.060]   they want to add more muscle or whatever, whatever.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.900]   Okay, great.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.240]   If you're like, I don't really know,
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.020]   you know, I just kind of work out,
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.340]   then run the fitness testing protocol.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.680]   You'll see what score is the lowest in,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.460]   and then you'll maybe make that a priority
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.760]   for the next, say, three months.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.680]   - So the first step is to identify a specific
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.120]   or set of specific training goals.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.600]   - A really nice tool for helping you set a goal
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.560]   is a system called SMART, right?
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   Now there's a little bit of debate
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.460]   on what those acronyms actually stand for,
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.120]   but we'll get close enough, right?
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.120]   So SMART is often specific, measurable, attainable,
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.100]   realistic, and timely.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.680]   So starting off with S, specific.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.360]   In general, the more specific your goal is,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.220]   the higher likelihood you will have at succeeding in that.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.080]   M, being measurable, means it needs to be something
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.280]   that you can actually put a metric on.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.220]   So this can be objective or subjective,
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.180]   but generally I like to have at least one objective measure.
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.400]   So remembering objective is something
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.000]   that is not based on feeling.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.840]   It is not up to you.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.860]   This could be something simple like your body weight.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.560]   It could be how much you can bench press.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.820]   What's your one mile time?
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.240]   And whatever is most important to you.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.040]   It actually doesn't have to be a fitness related goal.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.940]   For example, if you're using fitness
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.300]   as a way to enhance your sleep.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.380]   The main metric you may be interested in is,
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.640]   you know, amount of hours slept.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.180]   It could be something like efficiency
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.440]   or whatever is most interesting.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.280]   It could be work productivity.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.160]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.740]   So it doesn't have to actually be the fitness goal.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.740]   But what is the motivation of why you're doing it?
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.740]   So that's specific, measurable, attainable, or actionable,
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.040]   as is often described,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.820]   is something that is within your capability.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.600]   So attainable, a bad example of attainable
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.900]   is something like my goal is to win more games.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.020]   That may not be up to you.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.760]   The other team you're playing, it could influence it.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.800]   The schedule, et cetera.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.220]   So attainable should be something
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.140]   that is within your control.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.100]   Realistic or relevant to you is something that is,
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.460]   again, something realistic that you can achieve.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.060]   You wouldn't want to make a goal that is,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.100]   you know, you want to double your body mass.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.380]   This is not going to happen.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.460]   So think about the constraints.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.380]   How old are you?
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.460]   What's your training experience?
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.640]   How much time do you really have to invest in this?
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.180]   And then pick something that is realistic.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.620]   And then honestly, my little twist here is,
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.820]   take that and minus 10%.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.300]   'Cause typically when people put together training programs,
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.180]   their goal tends to be quite lofty,
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.360]   and they get some small percentage of the way in,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.980]   realize they're never going to get there, and then back off.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.320]   We actually, this sort of reminds me
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.260]   of a classic deception study that we did in my lab one time
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.500]   where we took people and we had them do
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.180]   this maximal front raise.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.740]   Basically, so you held a dumbbell out in front of you
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.580]   for as long as you possibly could.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.860]   And the goal here was actually,
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.660]   it's a deception study, so we're tricking them.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.220]   And so we said, okay, we want to just get normative values
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.180]   to see how long people can hold this front raise.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.520]   And I think we used something like 5% of their body weight.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.020]   And so they came in and they did it one time,
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.140]   and we timed them.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.300]   They didn't get to see the clock, they left.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.180]   And then we said, we got to come back in and repeat it,
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.720]   right, we got to do a couple of tries here
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.920]   to get a normal value in case it's off or whatever.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.920]   Well, the participants were split up into four groups.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.780]   So group one actually was told that their time
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.060]   was 15% lower than that they actually got.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.260]   Group two was 5% lower.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.580]   Group three was 5% higher.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.160]   And group four was 15% higher.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.780]   So the second time they came in to do it,
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.960]   our graduate student "made a mistake"
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.540]   and left the timer in front of them.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.100]   So the first time again, they did the exercise,
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.940]   they're just holding it.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.740]   They don't have any idea how long they're holding.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.760]   The second time they had a giant iPad set,
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.500]   like just a little bit off center,
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.860]   or they can clearly see it.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.440]   So they watched the time go by.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.400]   And of course, what happened was,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.460]   those folks say who did one minute,
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.280]   the very first time when they tested,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.220]   they came back in to do the second time
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.680]   and they're holding it.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.260]   And we told them they actually got 45 seconds.
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.300]   When in reality, they had done a minute.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.200]   So they're holding it and holding it.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.060]   And they think they only did 45 seconds.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.180]   By the time they get to like second 40, 41, 42,
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:42.180]   they get past 45, they almost all quit like 47, 48 seconds.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.220]   'Cause they wanted to beat their previous score,
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.180]   but then were like, cool, I beat it and then they quit early.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.000]   So they were actually not yet to failure,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.540]   but they were just happy enough
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.340]   to beat what they thought they'd done and then they quit.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.260]   The other group on the inverse side,
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.740]   again, say they got a minute.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.440]   We told them they got a minute and 15 seconds.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.260]   They got to like 45 seconds, 50 seconds
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.100]   and started realizing,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.580]   oh man, I have 30 more seconds to go.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.140]   And they quit way early
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.360]   because the carrot was way too far out.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.400]   They realized I'm never gonna get there.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.420]   So I'm just gonna stop now.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.380]   Can you guess which group did the best on the post-test?
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.760]   - Ones that were just within about 5% of.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.600]   - Totally.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.260]   So they wanted to improve.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.980]   And so again, say they got a minute the first time.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.700]   We told them they got a minute five
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.160]   or sorry, they got a minute five the first time.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.260]   We told them they only got a minute.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260]   They actually exceeded that greatly
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.560]   because they wanted the PR.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.440]   So making sure that that goal is properly aligned,
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.560]   it needs to be a little bit scary,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.740]   a little bit unrealistic.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.740]   Well, you're gonna have to work for this.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.300]   If it's too easy, you'll quit.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.260]   You won't feel like a challenge.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.960]   If it's too hard though, you'll quit early as well.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.140]   So you wanna make sure it's that reasonable balance of like,
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.280]   ah, should I train today?
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.620]   Or like maybe I'll just go through.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.980]   If I do that, I'm not gonna hit.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.040]   I gotta get after it.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.820]   But not like, oh my God, like there's just no chance here.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.480]   So you're gonna walk away early.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.420]   - That's a fantastic study, I have to say.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.860]   It's very simple.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.340]   I think it illustrates a number
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.060]   of important psychological principles
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.260]   about goal setting, motivation, self-perception,
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.980]   but also the dopamine system.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:28.520]   The dopamine system is this universal reward system
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.840]   that meaning it doesn't only work for food
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.100]   or only work for fitness goals
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.380]   or only work for academic goals or relationship goals.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.400]   It is the universal substrate for all of that.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.540]   And I actually think there's some real gems of information
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.740]   in the study design that you described.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.980]   So just cue that for maybe a potential collaboration
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.100]   between our laboratories,
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.480]   because I think it's very important,
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.540]   but it does cue up another question
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.020]   relevant to fitness in particular,
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.880]   which is, what are your thoughts on intermediate goals?
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.880]   So let's say my goal is to drop 2% of body fat
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.160]   from where I am now, a year from now.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.120]   Roll into the next year from now,
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.720]   about 2% lower on body fat,
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   but maintain my lean body mass or maybe even increase it.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.020]   How should I assess progress?
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.260]   Because the dopamine system loves a goal,
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.380]   it loves anticipation of a goal,
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.820]   but it responds best to we sort of re-up, if you will,
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.560]   our dopamine anytime we get a signal
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.880]   that we are on the right track to that goal.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.040]   And that signal could be, okay, I did the workout.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.400]   I just trust that these workouts
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.720]   are going to give me the result I want.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.740]   But of course, we know that when people get a glimmer
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.900]   of the idea or some objective feedback
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.420]   that they're on the right path,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.300]   that dopamine system really fires and provides motivation
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.180]   for continuing toward the ultimate goal.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.500]   And as we've talked about in the strength, speed
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.100]   and hypertrophy episode, resistance training itself
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.760]   has this built into it because of the infusion of blood
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.100]   into the muscles, you actually get a little window
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.680]   into what you might get in terms of an adaptation
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.800]   simply by way of the so-called pump.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.720]   Whereas endurance type work generally doesn't have that.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.660]   You don't see yourself get better, drop back
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.100]   and then adapting to actually get better.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.240]   But that's actually what you see with weight training.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.260]   So given all of that contour of the dopamine system,
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.620]   what sorts of intermediate goals should I set for myself
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.000]   or should somebody set for themselves?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.140]   And I realize it will probably depend on the ultimate goal,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.900]   but would you say check in on progress once every week,
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.260]   every month, three months?
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.740]   - I can't, I don't know if you can tell the look on my face.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.740]   I love this question and this topic.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.340]   I spend so much time on it on my senior graduate level
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.820]   program design course.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.020]   I've been fortunate to work with a few athletes
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.260]   where we've had multiple years.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.820]   And if you can really take the time to step back and go,
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.820]   it's not about optimizing for the next six weeks.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.700]   And in this case, it's not the next fight.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.620]   It is the championship fight that we need to get to
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.380]   in three years, or it is the Olympics,
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.860]   which run a quad program, right?
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.100]   You're really optimizing for that four year.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.700]   If you can have that foresight and really think about
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.620]   that and then work backwards,
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.300]   you can see some pretty tremendous things.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.740]   The sort of saying that is like we tend to overestimate
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.360]   what we can get done in a week and underestimate
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.200]   what can happen in a year.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   That can be extraordinarily powerful.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   However, you have to have those metrics called out
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.540]   ahead of time because you will lose motivation
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.020]   in that short term because you won't see
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.920]   that result immediately.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.820]   But if you remember, I'm on a path to 4% or 2%
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.820]   or whatever you need to be.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.200]   Therefore, I only need to be this far right now.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.580]   I need to be that far and then that far.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.540]   It's actually quite clear.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.160]   And so what we would actually do in that scenario,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.840]   not to go like so off track here,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.700]   'cause I can really go on this stuff,
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.860]   is let's say it was the year recommendation.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.020]   You're gonna actually need to go to the last part of smart,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.300]   which is timely.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.420]   So part of setting this goal is making sure
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.220]   you understand the time domain responsible.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.340]   And it's actually quite great here because
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.500]   not to go inception on us where we're like list
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.900]   within a list and Rob kills us over here,
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.900]   but number one of this program design thing
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.980]   was assessing your goal.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.900]   Number two is identifying your defender.
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.960]   What I mean by that is what is stopping you
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.780]   from hitting that goal?
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.140]   So you wanna lose 2% body fat in the next year.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.500]   Okay, great.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.580]   What's gonna stop us?
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.740]   Once we can achieve that,
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.720]   and we'll go into more of that in a second,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.460]   then you just start walking that 2% backwards.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.920]   So you might have to go something like this.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.880]   Look, every time I start working out really hard,
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.740]   I always get hurt.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.580]   Interesting.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.400]   Okay, great.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.720]   So maybe instead of jumping really hard
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.500]   into a high intensity interval training program,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.720]   knowing we're likely to hurt something
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.320]   or get burnt out or quit
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.800]   or whatever the defender is for you,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.000]   maybe we invest something right now,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.300]   which is maybe improving your flexibility
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.560]   or working on movement technique.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.080]   Whatever's gonna stop you from getting hurt.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.240]   Or maybe we progress slower so we don't get there.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.580]   That will allow us to do the work necessary
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.140]   to hit that goal 12 months from now,
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.040]   not two weeks from now, not two months from now.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.020]   Maybe that's not the case.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.800]   Maybe you're like, no, look, hey, I move well.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.600]   I feel like I'm in decent shape.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.060]   I've got enough muscle mass on me.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.400]   We've talked in previous episodes
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.620]   why having insufficient muscle mass
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.240]   is sometimes detrimental for fat loss.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.500]   So you checked all that boxes.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.400]   I don't get hurt very often, right?
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.540]   I got equipment around, no problem.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.680]   I've got the time in my schedule
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.320]   and I have enough muscle, great.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.980]   Well, now we maybe just split it up and say,
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.240]   look, we got 12 months, we got 2%.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.880]   It's as simple as doing a half a percent
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.360]   per quarter of the year.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.120]   And now all we're looking at is that number, right?
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.040]   I don't have to necessarily get all these things done.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.040]   I can go quarter, half percent, half percent,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040]   half percent, half percent.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.840]   You're gonna get there, right?
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.560]   The other scenario that I laid out a second ago,
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.380]   it maybe needs to look like something like this.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.420]   Quarter one is gonna be 0%.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.300]   Like, whoa, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   You may not lose a pound for the next three months.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.100]   We don't care.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.140]   That's not the goal of these three months.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.840]   I know that's the goal this year.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.380]   That's our major macro cycle goal.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.220]   We're going to get there,
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.780]   but to get there most effectively,
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.960]   we need to invest in working more with your chiropractor
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.980]   or whatever the thing is, right?
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.080]   That will allow us to then go half a percent quarter two,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.340]   when we can really start training,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.640]   but we're gonna ramp into it.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.320]   Quarter three, we're gonna go another half a percent.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.760]   And now we're halfway there.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.220]   Quarter four, we've invested so much.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.280]   You're ready to go.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.120]   We're gonna go hard.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.680]   We're gonna get that last 1%, that last quarter,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.520]   and we're gonna get there and you won't be hurt.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.360]   - So that makes it very clear.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.800]   And I can also envision how the precise structure
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.240]   of these intermediate goals would vary
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.880]   depending on what sort of adaptation,
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.720]   one is pursuing.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.800]   And I do remember from our previous episodes
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.960]   that fat loss itself is not an adaptation.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.800]   It is a by-product of other adaptations.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.560]   So I just want to make sure that you know
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.280]   that I was paying attention.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.500]   It's committed to memory.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.340]   - Absolutely.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:30.100]   - Some goals such as fat loss are very quantifiable
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.660]   and yet they might not be linear, right?
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.320]   It's hard to know.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.360]   The assumption is if you ingest X fewer calories
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.340]   than are required per day,
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.080]   then you'll lose X amount of weight,
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.640]   some percentage from body fat.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.520]   I think that cues up the idea
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.700]   that we need to build some flexibility
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.520]   into our thinking about these intermediate goals
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.400]   in order to just make sure that dopamine system
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.820]   isn't tethered to exact numbers.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.960]   Because after all, a reduction in 2% body fat,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.120]   for instance, is really a desire to achieve
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.240]   a different sort of overall body composition
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.680]   or re-composition.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.560]   I don't know, by the way, that that's my exact goal.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.680]   I think one of my goals is to be able
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.260]   to run a mile faster.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.360]   And I'm sort of haunted by this experience
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.120]   of wanting to run across country in college
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.700]   and trying to walk on.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.040]   We weren't a Division I school,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.660]   but the threshold for being considered for the team
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.180]   was you had to run a sub-10 minute two mile,
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.160]   which turns out to be very, very fast.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.740]   - That's really hard, yeah.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.000]   - I did not do that.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.400]   I didn't even come close.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.300]   And I don't think that I could reasonably do that now.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.880]   I'm not interested in committing
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.520]   to the kind of training required.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.960]   The sacrifice isn't meaningful enough for me.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.480]   - Fair and honest.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.240]   - But lowering one's mile,
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.040]   time to run a mile by, I don't know, 10%,
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.480]   seems like a reasonable goal across six months.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.600]   - Sure. - Great.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.500]   So in the case of a goal like that,
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.720]   clearly there are specific training programs,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.420]   but this raises the issue of
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.760]   what if I have other goals as well?
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.460]   And at what point do people having multiple goals
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.620]   start to set up collisions between goals?
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.320]   How do we know whether or not something is reasonable,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.900]   not just on its own,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.180]   but because of the other things
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.940]   that one has structured into their program?
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.360]   So being able to reduce a mile time by 10% in six months,
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.860]   okay, maybe that's doable, maybe it's not.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.760]   You can tell me.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.020]   But also being able to double the amount
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.600]   that they can do for a single repetition leg extension,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   for that matter, at the same time,
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.300]   that seemed like incompatible goals.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.220]   - Right, so a couple of things.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   Number one, the more specific and precise
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.580]   you can be with a single goal,
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.120]   the faster you will get there, generally.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.520]   So in theory, if you had one thing you wanted to achieve,
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.520]   the best way to go about it is to focus on that.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.640]   Give it the most priority.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.900]   That doesn't mean you can't do anything else along the way.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.280]   You can, but you would want to focus on that.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.080]   The more additional goals you bring in,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.940]   the more distraction you're creating for that primary goal.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.220]   Depending on what those goals are,
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.880]   you can actually do them at the same time.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.700]   Some other combinations are less effective.
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.720]   Think about it like this.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   We went through those nine adaptations
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.140]   and we went through them in a specific order on purpose.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.620]   The closer those adaptations are together in that list,
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.500]   the more compatible they are to training each other.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.540]   The further away, they become more challenging.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.020]   So just to give a few examples,
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.380]   if you wanted to improve your speed and power,
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.540]   you could basically train those simultaneously.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.100]   They would not interfere with each other at all.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.860]   In fact, since power is speed times force,
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.780]   it would be complimentary.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.980]   If you just walk down the line from there to strength,
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:56.820]   hey, same thing.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.100]   If you get faster, that's gonna aid in strength
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.760]   because force is mass times acceleration.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.900]   So if you improve acceleration,
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.920]   you're contributing to strength.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.180]   Same thing with power.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.260]   So speed, power, and strength
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.820]   are generally very complimentary.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.700]   You can absolutely train all three of those goals
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.960]   at the same time and have no issues.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.160]   Getting into hypertrophy.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.480]   Now we've got a little bit of distinction.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.660]   If you're gonna train strength and hypertrophy,
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.840]   as we talked about in that episode,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.220]   at the base, those are gonna be complimentary.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.740]   You add on some muscle, you're gonna get stronger.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.980]   You start training for strength,
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.900]   it's probably gonna help you out on some muscle mass.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.460]   As you get to the end of that spectrum,
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.940]   the overlap between the two starts to go away
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.040]   such that if you truly wanted to maximize strength
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.900]   above everything else,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.100]   if you continue to train for hypertrophy as well,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.040]   that's going to take too many resources
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.720]   out of your recovery bin and you won't be able to do that.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.020]   The inverse would also be the same.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.700]   If you're training to maximize strength,
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.160]   you wouldn't be able to put enough volume on
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.180]   to get sufficient hypertrophy.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.180]   So if you wanted to then combine speed with hypertrophy,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.420]   you're going farther away from each other,
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.060]   which means it's going to be more and more distraction.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.100]   So the hypertrophy training would cause a ton of fatigue.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.660]   You wouldn't be able to go at max speed
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.380]   for your speed or power strength.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.140]   So you're gonna be compromising those results.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.460]   Now, speed training won't compromise
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.560]   your hypertrophy training because it's non fatiguing.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.220]   Right, and so boom, here we have a little bit
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.820]   of an interference effect one way,
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.580]   but probably not the other.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.300]   Let's move down the spectrum one more time
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.260]   and get into endurance.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.580]   We won't go through all of these things,
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.140]   but you're getting the idea here.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.740]   Oh, a little bit of a high intensity intervals.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.060]   Okay, cool.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.060]   Now, would that compromise my speed, power or strength?
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.900]   Probably because there's a little bit of residual fatigue.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.300]   If the volume was low enough, then you'd be fine.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.980]   All you're worried about there is not necessarily
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.180]   like some sort of cellular mechanism.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.820]   It's just simple fatigue.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.820]   It is amount of energy expenditure versus
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.940]   is that compromising my recovery to come back?
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.100]   Would those first three or four of those,
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.080]   speed, power, strength, interfere with your ability
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.140]   to elevate your anaerobic capacity?
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.860]   Probably not.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:14.700]   Almost surely.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.440]   In fact, if you look at any of the literature
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.180]   on endurance training, you will see that speed,
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:25.060]   power and strength almost always improve endurance.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.460]   Endurance training added on top of strength
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.300]   can be detrimental, can have a neutral effect,
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.220]   but generally doesn't help one get stronger
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.260]   by adding additional conditioning.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.820]   Unless you're so unfit, you can't get through
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.700]   the volume needed in the strength training.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.620]   One more example here so we don't drag this out too far.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.260]   In the case of something like I wanna lose fat,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.900]   well hey, we don't have to worry about interference.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.260]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.280]   If you're fatigued for your hypertrophy session,
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.580]   not a big deal.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.740]   We're just trying to get some work done.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.140]   If your hypertrophy session fatigued you
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.500]   from your conditioning, it's cool
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.360]   'cause you got the work done.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.680]   So you don't have to worry about it so much.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.140]   So it really kinda depends on the actual goal
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.740]   and what you wanna pay attention to is actually
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.580]   what are the chances of overlap,
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.740]   which means what are the adaptations you get physiologically
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.260]   that cross over from one to the other,
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.580]   and then what are the ones that are actually
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.460]   gonna start interfering?
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.100]   In fact, in my class, I have this giant matrix chart
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.740]   of interference effect going from adaptations
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.020]   through a whole bunch of systems,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.780]   everything from handling pH to lymphatic drainage
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.380]   to bone mineral density, et cetera.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.620]   You can walk through these whole things and say,
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.300]   which ones actually have a positive effect?
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.580]   Which ones have a massive positive effect?
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.700]   And then which ones actually have
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.700]   a little bit of interference?
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.980]   And perhaps if you guys are nice enough,
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.800]   we could throw that into a newsletter or something,
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.400]   some PDF or something.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.860]   - I think that would be immensely valuable.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.140]   I think some of that more extensive information
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.220]   when it's laid out in grid form like that
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.820]   would be really useful. - It's easier to contend with.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.900]   - Well, now we've said it.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.440]   - I didn't say it would do it, I said perhaps.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.580]   - I think it's a great idea.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.080]   I think it's a terrific idea.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.820]   The idea that items closer to each other on the list
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.340]   of those nine different adaptations
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.200]   are going to be easier to achieve in parallel
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.560]   than items further apart makes perfect sense.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:28.260]   And what I heard was that there's a few caveats
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.900]   that might seem minor, but they're actually quite important,
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.220]   such as anything that is relatively low intensity
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.820]   and doesn't impede recovery can probably be included
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.880]   as a parallel goal.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.420]   So some speed work in conjunction
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.220]   with some long duration cardio work.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.060]   - No problem. - For instance,
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.660]   even though we're talking about number two on that list
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.100]   and number nine on that list.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.060]   - In that case, the long duration endurance,
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.220]   even if it's low intensity, may actually interfere
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.860]   with the speed if the volume gets too high.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.320]   If you're talking about, I went on a 30 minute jog,
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.620]   for most people that it's totally fine.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.820]   What we're really talking about here
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.960]   is when the miles start piling up
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.360]   or the time really starts getting there
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.900]   in combination with some of the things,
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.100]   the factors we've talked about earlier,
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.080]   which is exercise choice.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.900]   So more eccentric landing based exercise choices,
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.440]   running, for example, is more likely to interfere
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.160]   than cycling, right?
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.320]   'Cause you're not landing.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.400]   Swimming is low impact.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.640]   So if you're gonna do those things,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.040]   you can hedge your bets a little bit
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.520]   by choosing an exercise choice that is less impactful.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.440]   Again, if we're literally,
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.540]   'cause there's oftentimes confusing here was like,
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.120]   oh, don't do 10 minutes on the treadmill before you lift.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.800]   You're gonna cut, oh, like timeout.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.120]   A warmup is fine.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.720]   We're really talking about probably more than 30 plus minutes
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.000]   at higher than 60% heart rate,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.120]   like random numbers, something like that.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.080]   Depends on the person, et cetera.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.260]   But it has to be a decent chunk.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.780]   Again, you can actually fix that
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.120]   by then just consuming calories.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.360]   You can also fix that by making sure everything else
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.440]   in the hidden invisible stressor bucket is improved.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.480]   So this is like one of our tricks that we'll get into
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.780]   when we get into the recovery,
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.720]   is you don't necessarily need to reduce your training
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.040]   if you just ramp up your recovery.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.320]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.760]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.440]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.920]   and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.400]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.640]   I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.240]   So I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.880]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.680]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.120]   once or twice a day is that it helps me meet
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.200]   all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.300]   That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals,
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.880]   and the probiotics are especially important to me.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.040]   Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.060]   which are critical for recovering from stress,
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.700]   from exercise, from work, or just general life.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.080]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.800]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.880]   to claim a special offer.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.420]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.840]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.480]   Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.040]   go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.640]   to claim the special offer.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.400]   I'm going to take the liberty of assuming
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.900]   that most people fall into one of either three bins
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.200]   in terms of their goals.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.720]   Again, most people, certainly there are going to be people
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.040]   that lie outside these bins.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.740]   I think if you polled 100 people or 100,000
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.880]   or a million people as to what their major goals were
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.460]   in working out, they'd say,
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.660]   as you so nicely listed out before,
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.100]   aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.300]   But that one in three really kind of sit higher
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.520]   than most people would like to perhaps even admit.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.600]   They want to look good,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.100]   which usually means they want to lose some fat,
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.020]   gain some muscle in specific places.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.260]   I realize there are folks out there
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.860]   who want to gain a lot of muscle, just muscle everywhere.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.080]   But I think most people would like to have
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.400]   a little more shape here or a little more muscle there
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.140]   to either balance out their aesthetic
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.940]   or to accentuate certain parts of their physique.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.340]   And they would probably like to shave off
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.180]   some subcutaneous fat,
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.340]   although there are those exceptionally lean people out there
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.000]   and they exist too.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.700]   I think it would be gain muscle in specific places,
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.860]   lose fat and do it in a way that also provides some booth
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.100]   to their health span and longevity.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.700]   I would say that that might even be 50% of people out there.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.240]   Again, I'm taking the liberty of guesstimating.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.500]   Another bin I would venture is interested in getting stronger
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.080]   and putting on more muscle.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.300]   Certainly there are a number of people
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.600]   that are interested in doing that.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.100]   And that could even be more muscle all over
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:45.220]   or more muscle with some accentuation to certain areas
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.340]   where they happen to be weaker
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.700]   or less developed as it were.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.300]   And then the third bin would be people
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.180]   that really enjoy cardiovascular work.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.820]   Oh, I should say the second bin,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.080]   probably care about their longevity also,
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.820]   but it's not really foremost.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.820]   Like, yeah, I feel great now and I'll live to be whatever,
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.420]   but I only want to do it if I get that much muscle, right?
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.140]   We know these kinds of folks.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.540]   - Yeah, I run a poll in my class every year
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.120]   when I ask like, "Why don't you guys all lift?"
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.100]   And of course, I make them put their hand up.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.020]   I'm like, "You guys are in my class,
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.960]   "you're gonna put your hand up, let you lift weights."
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.660]   And then I ask them like, "Why do you train?"
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.300]   And like health is, long-term health is like on the list
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.360]   and they all, I'm like any of you that selected health
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.500]   are liars.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.500]   Like you're 20 to 25, you are not exercising for health.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.200]   You're exercising 'cause you want to look a certain way
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.180]   or get stronger.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.840]   Once you get past that undergraduate age though,
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.900]   the actual desire to live longer and better
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.500]   actually becomes pretty real.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.720]   - Yeah, I think that there are people
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.700]   who want to feel better.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.540]   They know that exercise and the results from exercise
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.780]   can make them feel better.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.620]   But yeah, that second bin tends to be more focused
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.280]   on the aesthetic change, it seems, or being strong.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.520]   And then the third category I think are people,
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.580]   I know a lot of folks like this, who really enjoy
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.220]   what are normally considered endurance type activities.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.740]   And here, I just want to highlight again
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.380]   what you so beautifully illustrated in previous episodes
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.000]   that you can gain a lot of endurance
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.320]   even using weights or machines.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.220]   It just depends on how you use them, right?
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.900]   It's not about the exercise,
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.700]   about how you perform them and et cetera.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.620]   And you, again, beautifully provided all those details
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.360]   as to how to create endurance
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.400]   regardless of equipment standards, et cetera.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.580]   But that third category seemed to be people
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:30.140]   who enjoy running, cycling, swimming, hiking, dancing,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.340]   activities that they can do for long periods of time
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.260]   that often will involve some sort of skill
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.660]   that is based on improving motor patterns.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.340]   So maybe not so much stride,
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:45.000]   but certainly for people that really love tennis.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.900]   People that love a sport like golf, right?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.200]   Do they want to be able to not just walk, you know,
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.620]   they want to walk the 18 holes,
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.900]   they want to have a great golf swing, et cetera.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.860]   I'm not a golf player, so forgive me if my nomenclature
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.540]   is off. - Golfer, golfer.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.000]   - Yeah, golfer. - You don't play golf.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:40:59.840]   - Oh, got it, you don't play golf.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.560]   - Well, you play golf, you wouldn't call a golf player.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.780]   - I played miniature golf a few times, that's about it.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.260]   Although, Stanford does have a beautiful golf course.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.220]   I'm told I should learn how to play golf.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.620]   - I'll come up and play it for you if you want.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.460]   You come up, I'll play it, I'll say how it is.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.520]   Get me on that course. - Almost see it from my lab.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.020]   So category one, I think,
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.080]   is a significant fraction of people.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.480]   So as we lay out these different ways to assess goals,
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   and as we approach the structure of a program,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.820]   as you'll tell us.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.640]   If we could perhaps touch back to those
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.800]   every once in a while.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.560]   Again, I'm taking the liberty of assuming
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.400]   that we will net about 80 to 90% of people out there.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.800]   Again, those categories being people who want to
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.400]   lose some fat, maybe build some muscle
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.000]   in specific areas on their body,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.360]   and really want to be healthy.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.240]   They want to feel great and they want to have
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.560]   a long health span, AKA end lifespan.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.040]   They want to live a long time feeling great.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.760]   Second category, people who want to build
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.040]   more muscle and strength.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.720]   Sure, they don't want to damage their health,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.100]   but that's not their main focus.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.800]   Their main focus is on building muscle and strength.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.640]   And then that third category of people who really
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.620]   want to do more endurance type work,
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.120]   feel great and strong doing it,
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.180]   but not because they can carry heavy weights
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.420]   while they're doing it, but rather they can feel vital
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.460]   and they can push harder for longer.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.380]   And maybe even translate that to some of the more
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.200]   recreational type activities or sports like tennis
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.940]   and things that are more long duration,
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.620]   playing soccer, maybe even softball or things of that sort.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.460]   - Yeah, surfing, swimming.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.320]   - So those three categories, maybe we could call those
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.280]   B and A, B and C for sake of today's discussion.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.600]   I think if you're willing to embrace that,
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.060]   I think that will be informative toward our listeners
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.920]   in a way that simply not assuming what people's
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   different goals are might not be able to accomplish.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.120]   Said differently, hopefully by doing that,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.260]   people will derive a lot more from the description
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.520]   of the program that you're going to give us.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.360]   - Love it.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.840]   - Now I am certain that I want to let you return
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.720]   to your list of the five things that people need to consider
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.640]   when establishing a exercise program.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.720]   - Yeah, great, let's do that.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.280]   I also do want to acknowledge a point
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.580]   you've brought up acutely.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.360]   Exercise doesn't mean just lifting weights.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.500]   That's my background, that's what I spend my time on.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.060]   So I sort of default to examples in that category,
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.620]   but it doesn't have to be that.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.900]   You've articulated plenty of other ways
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.580]   where you can get amazing forms of exercise
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.580]   that have nothing to do with lifting weights.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.340]   So for those folks in, was it Bin C or three?
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.180]   I can't remember.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.460]   - Bin C, we go A is gain muscle, lose fat,
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.680]   be healthy now and forever.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.520]   - Right.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.920]   - Bin B is get stronger, gain muscle,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.940]   don't damage your health,
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.080]   but not really focus on health in the immediate term.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.440]   And then Bin C is want to play
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.340]   or do endurance type activities
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.760]   and quote unquote feel strong doing it.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.320]   So have more vigor to be able to do that longer
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.040]   and maybe with more attention to skill, et cetera.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.280]   And of course also want to improve their health.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.160]   - What you've effectively done
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   is you've given us three different avatars
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.040]   with three different goals, right?
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.360]   So the next step for each person or group
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   is going to be to identify their defenders.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.040]   But before we get that,
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.480]   we got to close the loop on this smart thing.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.560]   So in each case, they have either chosen that goal
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.160]   based on their personal preference
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.240]   or perhaps they did our fitness testing protocol
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.220]   and realize they need to gain strength.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:30.220]   So whether the reason they chose to be in buckets B or A or C
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.880]   was because of our protocol or personal preference,
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.080]   it really doesn't matter.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.160]   They still want to go through this process
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.600]   of laying out their goals
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.080]   and making sure that again, they are specific, right?
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.280]   So let's go through BNC, which is a great one.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.160]   So you want to have more energy
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.440]   and you want to feel stronger
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.480]   when you're doing your kite boarding.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.560]   You want to feel stronger
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.480]   when you finish your round of tennis,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.460]   round of golf, game of tennis.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.560]   Okay, great.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.780]   That's a different strength.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.620]   Absolutely.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.640]   See, I hear, I know what you're saying though.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.480]   Amazing.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.040]   So that goal needs to be specific to that, right?
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.840]   So it would be hard to make a goal like
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.140]   I want to feel better at the end of my round.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.780]   Boy, that depends on too many other factors.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.420]   A better goal would be something like this.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.260]   I want to be able to run this two mile loop
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.260]   that I do around my neighborhood
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:25.260]   and I want to do it and have a lower heart rate at the end
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.340]   or I want to be able to get my heart rate back,
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.260]   my heart rate recovery back faster.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.100]   Amazing.
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.140]   That will probably align with you
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.720]   feeling quote unquote stronger with it, right?
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.640]   So I did the same course and either I can do it
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.880]   at the same speed and it's not nearly as hard
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.260]   or I can go faster, whichever one, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.620]   But that would be an example of a specific goal.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.180]   The other buckets you laid out
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.880]   kind of already have specific goals
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.580]   like I want to get stronger.
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.260]   Well, that's going to be the goal.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.660]   The other one is going to be, you know,
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.620]   I want to lose some fat.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.300]   Okay, that's kind of, the goal is sort of implicit in that.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.720]   It's the other people where you're just like,
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.740]   I don't really care about that.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.700]   I just want to be able to surf the great waves
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.360]   and then not feel exhausted afterwards.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.300]   All right, cool.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.040]   Well, then you still should pick a metric
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.720]   that is not that activity maybe
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.500]   'cause it won't be within your control
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.960]   depending on the waves and the temperature
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.520]   and all this stuff that you can use as a proxy to say,
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.200]   if I were to do something that represented me
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.220]   feeling probably better when I surf, what would that be?
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.060]   And it's not perfect,
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.120]   but it would be still as specific as you could get.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.560]   You still want to make sure it's measurable.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.660]   Again, this example might be something like
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.440]   you're going to go to the pool and time
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.460]   how long it takes you to swim 800 meters or something, right?
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.020]   It's attainable and then you'll set a goal
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.680]   that's realistic and timely.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.060]   I'm going to improve by 5% in the next two months.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:47.900]   Okay, cool.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.500]   That probably falls into the realm.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.400]   And then you're making the assumption that if you did that,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.060]   you'll probably feel better when you go out
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.180]   to do your primary activity, which is say surf.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.680]   The reality of it is every time we work
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.540]   with an actual athlete, that's what we do.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.140]   Athletes don't come to us to lift weights.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.520]   They don't come to us to get stronger.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.020]   They come to us because they want to play better
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.540]   and they want to stay on the field more.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.280]   What we're trying to convince them of is
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.000]   if you do this thing in the gym,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.060]   then that should translate into you being better
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:19.280]   at your sport, recovering faster, being less injured.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.620]   But it's still just a proxy.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.700]   And so that's all you're doing
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.500]   with these other non-specific goals,
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.460]   especially when they're performance-based goals.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.120]   And we didn't package it that way,
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.400]   but that's really what you talked about for Ben C there.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.700]   It is a performance-based goal.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.760]   I want to be able to perform when I'm in the field.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.700]   In my brain, that's a sport.
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.640]   In your brain, it's when you're at yoga class.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.440]   It's the same thing.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.300]   We've said this earlier in our series
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.900]   that if you have a body, you're an athlete.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.380]   I want to prepare your body
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:49.500]   such that it can do exactly what you want it to do.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.160]   You then get to have the choice of what you ask it to do.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.040]   You call it a sport.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.660]   You call it your Saturday hike with your family.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.020]   I don't really care.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.880]   It's the same thing.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.580]   You get control of your body performing
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.100]   the way you want it to perform,
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.060]   and that's what this whole thing is about.
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.040]   Great, so now that we've covered, I think,
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.100]   as much as we need to regarding assessing
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.400]   and choosing a goal,
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.460]   I want to get back to this idea
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.260]   of identifying your defender.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.040]   So you really need to think carefully
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.420]   about what is stopping you from hitting those goals.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.740]   And so you're forecasting a little bit.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.780]   You're also going back into your own personal history.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.260]   Do you have history of knee pain?
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:30.020]   Do you have a history of working too much?
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.080]   Do you have a history of a lot of travel?
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.780]   Do you have a history of getting sick a lot?
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.980]   What are these things that are happening
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.220]   that are gonna stop you from hitting your goal?
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.900]   A couple of examples I've already laid out,
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.680]   so we don't need to go too much longer here,
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   but in the case of somebody who is in maybe bin A,
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.800]   which is I want to lose some fat,
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.220]   maybe gain a little bit of muscle.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.700]   Okay, what's stopping you
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.000]   from the strength and conditioning side?
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.740]   Is it the fact that you can't train consistent enough?
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.120]   Is it a fact that when you go to train,
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.540]   you don't know what to do?
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.820]   Is it a fact that when you go to train,
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.480]   you train your ass off and you're not getting results?
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.320]   Okay, great.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.860]   All three of these different scenarios
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.720]   are going to result in different programs
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.920]   because they have different reasons you're failing.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.460]   And that is really critical.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.020]   Instead of just going, I want a fat loss program,
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.140]   and picking one up off the internet,
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.140]   it may not actually be addressing
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.820]   the point of failure for you.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.820]   So the sooner you can choose your programs
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.700]   based on why you're failing,
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.980]   the sooner you'll start getting results.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:34.060]   You have to run a little bit of a critical analysis there,
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:38.300]   and it can be something scientific,
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.500]   and it could be a measurement.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.380]   And it also could just be you thinking about,
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.640]   you've tried this in the past, and why didn't it work?
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.400]   I wasn't that interesting.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.100]   Okay, tell me more about why it wasn't interesting.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.700]   I'm not really into machines, and that's all I had.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.900]   Okay, great.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.380]   Or I loved it, I loved the gym I was at,
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.480]   and I was getting results, but it was so far away.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.220]   Okay, interesting.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.300]   Why did you stop before, why didn't it work?
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.600]   Or if it did work in the past, amazing.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.080]   Let's go back to something similar,
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.820]   but has your life changed at all?
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.300]   Is there anything different about now
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.100]   than when it worked three years ago?
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.980]   Yes, no.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.140]   If not, maybe we run it right back.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.280]   If it is, okay, we're gonna sort of predict those things.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.520]   And you wanna work, effectively what I'm saying is,
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.260]   throughout this entire 10-step process is going to be,
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.380]   you wanna make sure that there are the non-negotiables
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.600]   that are in your life that you know are going to be ahead
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.100]   of your fitness program, and you wanna work
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.180]   with those things, not against them.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.140]   'Cause life will win.
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.180]   When it comes to your children, when it comes to your job,
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.920]   life is going to win.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.720]   You're gonna have to give up something.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.440]   It's gonna take some hard work.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.740]   But we wanna fight the right battles for most people.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.800]   Even for our professional athletes,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.640]   we get this all the time,
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.620]   it's just like they have nothing else to do but train.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.400]   They're like, whoa, hold on now, they're getting traded,
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.660]   they have agents to deal with, they may not have a contract,
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.340]   they have families, blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.480]   Life will get in the way, I promise.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.160]   And so you wanna fight the battles that you can win,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.160]   not ones that you're going to lose.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.820]   And so that's really what this game is about.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.780]   So if the battle is, hey, my job is super hectic.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.820]   Okay, great.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.340]   We're gonna come up with a different strategy
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.220]   that's more flexible, maybe.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.940]   I'm still gonna hold you to the fire,
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.220]   I'm not gonna be easier on you,
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.820]   but we're just not going to try to set up a situation
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.460]   where you have to do this workout Monday,
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.360]   Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.980]   Because you know your job is on the road
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:33.460]   and you provide all the income for your family.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.860]   Whatever the thing is, right?
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.340]   That's what we really wanna identify.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.200]   So when I say identify your defenders,
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.420]   you need to run a little bit of a critical analysis on this.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:46.520]   And a little bit of a tool I'll use for this
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.900]   is a modification of another system
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.540]   I stole from Kenny Kane, which is what we call
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.380]   the quadrant system.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.780]   So you can imagine everything in your life
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.020]   goes into one of four buckets, all right?
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.740]   Now bucket one, I'm just gonna call business.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.340]   And this has anything to do with your job,
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.900]   income, sort of all those things.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:08.120]   Bucket two is relationships.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.660]   So again, this could be family or love life,
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.420]   like anything that we would call relationships,
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:17.420]   social connection, purpose, anything, right?
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.500]   Bucket three is your fitness.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.220]   And bucket four is your recovery.
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.360]   So one of the first steps we take
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.800]   is we walk through this and we say,
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:30.580]   all right, you have 10 points total.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.580]   And you get to distribute these 10 points
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.040]   across the four areas.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.500]   So not 10 each, you get 10 total.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.520]   As we walk through and we say, right now,
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.060]   where are you giving your points?
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.000]   And we could do this right now for you if you'd like,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.820]   or I could make up a scenario.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.660]   Do you wanna do it?
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.600]   - Sure. - Great.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.620]   So Andrew, right now in the last month,
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:58.300]   if you had 10 points total in those four categories,
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.760]   where would you be distributing the most points?
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.660]   Which category and how many points would that be?
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.540]   - Business, my work.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.880]   - Business, work, job, sort of all those things.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.940]   And how many out of 10?
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.300]   - Which doesn't, I should say, ever quite feel like work.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.980]   Running a laboratory and doing the podcast
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.420]   doesn't ever really feel like work in the traditional sense,
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:22.420]   but it's career, it's work, it involves relationships,
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.260]   but it certainly doesn't enhance my fitness,
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.780]   except of my vocal cords and recovery.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:34.780]   So with those notes there, I would say four to five.
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:40.320]   - You pick.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.380]   - Five. - Five, fair.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.620]   That's the most common number.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.620]   - Five, business five.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.900]   - Great, once again I'm typical, which makes me happy.
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:48.720]   - You nailed it.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.420]   - One of the few ways in which I've been accused
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.820]   of being normal, I picked five for business.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.940]   - No kidding.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.180]   What's the next highest and what's that score?
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.740]   - I do invest in relationships, I would say,
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:06.460]   does it have to be around, can it be a decimal?
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.620]   - It has to be a whole integer.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.720]   - Oh, a whole integer.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.460]   Two.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.200]   - Two, all right, we're seven out of 10 here.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.460]   So would you say it is fair that you spend
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:23.100]   roughly 2 1/2% of your, it's not necessarily time,
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.880]   it's energy, time, focus, sort of all of these things,
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.260]   2 1/2 times as much on your business
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.420]   as you do in your relationships?
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.800]   - It varies depending on what's going on.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.320]   It feels a little skewed in the direction of business,
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.360]   so I might want to adjust to a four, three ratio there.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.200]   - Maybe not, no.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   - I'm gonna hold to five, two business relationships,
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.420]   and then just for sake of example,
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.240]   and because this doesn't seem like
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:57.860]   a exceedingly precise measure, it can have some slop.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.700]   - Of course.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.560]   Where would you put fitness in recovery?
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.700]   - I definitely put energy into fitness,
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.140]   so I'm gonna give that also a two.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:08.980]   - Yep.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:12.180]   Which leaves?
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.240]   - Two to one for recovery.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.420]   - Great.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:16.680]   That, what you just laid out is, again,
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.980]   the most quintessential split you could have.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.240]   In fact, you run this game on everyone,
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.820]   they're gonna come up with basically the same answer,
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.740]   unless they don't work out or whatever, right?
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.700]   Okay, so a couple of rules here.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:31.700]   Recovery must be at minimum half of your fitness allocation.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.520]   In your case, two to one.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.360]   You're fine.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.200]   - I thought you were gonna say it has to be half,
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.100]   like it has to be five out of 10 points.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:37.940]   - No.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.660]   - In which case, it doesn't leave much for anything else.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.540]   - I would like it to be minimum 20% of the total,
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.580]   which means two out of 10.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.500]   Now, and when I say recovery, I don't simply mean muscle.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.360]   I mean, you need personal time.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.380]   You need meditation.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.960]   You need sleep.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.820]   You need to go to a concert and get out and see people.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.140]   And so, like, whatever the things
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.220]   that give you energy back, right?
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.600]   Some folks, that's personal time.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.360]   Some folks, that's social time.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.600]   Whatever that means to you, right?
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.340]   - Yeah, I actually get a lot of energy from my work.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.380]   And so, that's why some of these numbers are a little bit,
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:14.400]   you can kind of cloak the underlying dynamics.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   - So here's what we do from this game.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.820]   We look at that and we say, if that's our split, Andrew,
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.620]   five, three, two, one.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.060]   - Five, two, two, one.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.100]   - Five, two, two, one.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.480]   - I'd love to be able to put three in relationships,
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.660]   just because, but then I need 11 out of--
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:30.220]   - Right, so here's the fun game we play.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.500]   You're currently at this and you don't get the add to 11.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.740]   You have to stay at 10.
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.920]   Your 10 is different than my 10, maybe, right?
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.100]   But 10 is 10, or just whatever the maximum
[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.900]   you can actually do, it's you.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.500]   So if we went back to our training goal,
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.240]   whatever that goal was for you,
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.780]   and we went back to our defenders,
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.980]   we would look at this score now and say,
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:54.220]   is three out of 10, fitness is three, right?
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.140]   - Fitness is two. - Fitness is two.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.540]   - So it's five, two, two, one.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.440]   - Is two out of 10 sufficient to hit that training goal
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.660]   in that timeframe you described?
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:07.700]   And let's say you said, I want to hit a new PR
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.400]   in my mile six months from now.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.860]   - Yeah, for simplicity's sake,
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.040]   and also because it's largely true,
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.680]   I'm going to put myself in what I referred to
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.680]   as bin A earlier, right?
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.980]   My bifat percentage is okay.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.540]   It's in the range that I would like,
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.920]   but I would like to bring it down a little bit,
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.560]   probably gain a little bit muscle here and there,
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.580]   keep or gain some endurance.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.440]   And certainly, certainly my immediate and long-term health
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.680]   are extremely important to me.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.520]   - Great.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.640]   So then the question and then the answer may be yes,
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.280]   that this is the optimal split for you.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.180]   If it is not, then we have to make a choice.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.320]   We either alter the goal or the timeline
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.320]   to make it realistic, or we alter our quadrant.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.360]   And then if we're going to alter our quadrant,
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.200]   the next step is critically important.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   We need a list of very specific life actions
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   that we're going to take that allows that split to happen.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.040]   So if you said, for example,
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.160]   I want to put three into relationships, great.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.760]   What specific life actions are you going to take
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.840]   to pull one from fitness,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.880]   you can't pull any from recovery or one from business?
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.600]   And you don't have to actually answer this,
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.080]   it's too personal. - Thank you.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.180]   - I know you don't like making these things about you 'cause-
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.800]   - Right, and that's the other reason to do it.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.520]   And it is a diabolical trick
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.800]   to insist that these be whole integers,
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.940]   'cause I would have done like a 4.5 for business
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.720]   and a 2.5 for relationships.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.840]   But obviously you write the rules on this, not me.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.280]   - So you would just walk through that list, okay?
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.440]   And the list could be something like,
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   I promise to not work after 7 p.m. Thursday through Sunday,
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.160]   or whatever the thing is, right?
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.800]   I promise I'm going to make sure
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.680]   that I don't start work before 8 a.m.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.600]   or whatever, right?
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.340]   No more trips.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:59.040]   Just make those things specific and measurable,
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.920]   not just like I'm going to work less.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.760]   That's never going to go.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.140]   What is the very specific life action you're going to take?
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.000]   There's going to be alarm that goes off Tuesday night
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   at 5 p.m., and no matter what we, at Barbell Shrugged,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.740]   we used to have a little shirt that was like D3AT,
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.480]   which is like drop everything and train.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.060]   Which means at 3 p.m. in the afternoon,
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:18.940]   no matter what's happening,
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.640]   we dropped everything and trained.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.740]   Because that was like when you start a business
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.600]   and you're going, things just run away from you, right?
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.140]   And it's just sort of like, man, it's not my company,
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:28.980]   but those guys are like,
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.600]   we are a strength and conditioning company
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.040]   and we're not training.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.440]   So we had to just make this hard rule
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.840]   and it was just like a little thing that came up
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.500]   and it was easy to say, drop everything and train,
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.780]   three o'clock, there you go.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:42.780]   - I like this drop D, E, everything, A, N, N blank.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:47.340]   Like it could be drop everything and pick your favorite.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.640]   - Totally, drop everything and read.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.440]   - Pick the relevant, read, yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.240]   I really miss reading for pleasure.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.160]   I would put that under recovery.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.440]   - Drop everything and breathe.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.440]   - Oh, and breathe, you were saying.
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.280]   Oh, and breathe.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.100]   I was saying read.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:00.940]   - I said that too.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.560]   - Yeah, because for me reading is actually
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.380]   is both recovery and relationship.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.580]   Because oftentimes in my relationships I insist,
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.580]   not insisted, I certainly didn't insist.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.460]   We've had a format of reading the same book in parallel.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:16.300]   - Oh, great.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.480]   - Yeah, not necessarily side by side,
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.280]   but the same book in parallel and then discussing it.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.720]   It's a wonderful practice
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.060]   or listening to the same audio book.
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.900]   - It works well.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.980]   You can do drop everything in play.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:26.860]   You're just going to go do something fun.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:27.780]   You're going to play video games.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.820]   You're going to go play with your kid.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.420]   You're going to do whatever, play with your dog.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.440]   It doesn't even have to actually be play,
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.220]   but play it to you could signify personal time.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.480]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.320]   So yeah, that's it.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.540]   - I really like this drop everything and blank category.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.560]   You probably shouldn't have more than what,
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.580]   two or three of those overall.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.580]   - Pretty much like one is the one to two, maybe.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.420]   - Great.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.240]   - Is where you want to go after that.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.220]   - So the idea is then to redistribute the numbers
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.740]   on this list, but through a very concrete action.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.980]   And I like this drop everything in blank
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.100]   because it speaks to the non-negotiable aspect of it.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.260]   - Has to be.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.380]   Life will get pushed.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.840]   - It's not a fine time to, right?
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.680]   - Correct.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.020]   - It's not in next year I'm going to.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:09.860]   - Correct.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:10.680]   - I love it.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.060]   - Yeah, when you put those things,
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.740]   those things you might as well just don't even put
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.580]   on your list, right?
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.420]   'Cause it's not going to happen.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.320]   - Yeah, you're talking to somebody who loves rules
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.740]   because when they are non-negotiable rules,
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.980]   they provide this incredible organizing force for the brain.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.260]   It's really a neuroscience thing in my mind.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.100]   - Totally.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.860]   - And actually we did an episode on happiness
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.220]   where you find that once people make a decision,
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.700]   if they eliminate the possibility of other decisions,
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.540]   literally the hatches close, that is it.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.380]   - Burn the boats.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:44.060]   - The rates of subjective happiness,
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:47.380]   immediate and long-term happiness over time go way, way up.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.980]   And so I'm convinced that the nervous system
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.740]   doesn't like to keep the valves
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.300]   on these dopamine circuits open.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.580]   I actually think it diminishes from the reward component.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.340]   And there are actually some data on this.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.220]   Anyway, I don't want to take us off track, but.
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.800]   - The last part of this, what we do then,
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.880]   is we take that quadrant and we take that list
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.720]   and then you're going to print it physically.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.260]   And you're going to put it in two places.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.360]   This could actually be on your phone.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.580]   You don't have to print, you can screenshot.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.480]   It can be the background of your phone.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.640]   So every time you click on your phone,
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.300]   you immediately see that quadrant.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.540]   Like it's a very clear reminder of like,
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.100]   what are my priorities today, right?
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.140]   Just a simple little picture.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.920]   I also like to put it in your place of failure.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.760]   So for a lot of people, that is like on their laptop
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.020]   or right above their workstation, right?
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.660]   It's like the thing that's going to lose
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.120]   and beat your fitness is your job typically, right?
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.880]   Or it's on your TV.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.940]   It's on your Netflix control.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.260]   No, sorry, Netflix, no offense.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.100]   But you know what I mean?
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.180]   Like it's whatever the thing is that you fail for.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.140]   I play too many video games.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.220]   Great, there, I work too much.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.060]   Okay, great.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.840]   And you put it there and you put it also,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.540]   the last component, it has to also be
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.900]   in the hands of somebody who can hold you accountable, right?
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.340]   Wife, training partner, business partner, whatever.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.260]   So it's like, hey, Andrew,
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.180]   like you promised you were going to do X yourself.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.660]   Why are you still here?
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.520]   You committed to this, you got to get out of here.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.420]   Someone who will like, be like, no, no,
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.220]   it's drop everything and read.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.820]   It's eight o'clock, you're supposed to be reading.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.660]   You got to go.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.000]   You're going to get a check back in on that.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.780]   Check back in every week, check back in.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.300]   It doesn't matter every month.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.740]   And then you can adjust, it's fine.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.900]   You can always change the system,
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.260]   but that has to now change.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.580]   You got to print a new one
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.640]   and now it's a whole new promise you've made yourself.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.820]   So you've got to be able to hold yourself accountable
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.640]   to those things.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.320]   It's got to be flexible enough to where it's realistic.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.700]   It can't be, I'm not going to work
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.440]   after six o'clock every day.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.620]   Maybe it's just three days a week.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.400]   Maybe it's on Saturdays I promise to work
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.220]   for the first two hours so I don't work Saturday night
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.180]   or whatever, or the inverse.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.500]   I'm not going to work Saturday, you get it.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.800]   You could come up with a million examples here.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.180]   So that's the system we use to make sure
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.000]   that we have now a properly identified where we're going.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.720]   We found a roadmap to that.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.180]   And now we know exactly how we're going to stay on track.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.940]   I have to take this opportunity to add one more thing
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.640]   to our drop everything list.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.300]   And you gave the example of deer,
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.220]   which is maybe drop everything and read
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:10.480]   or drop everything and relax or another example.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.500]   I have to add a deal, which is drop everything.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.600]   And this is for you, Lex, love.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.660]   - Actually one of the advantages of having a dog
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.180]   or having children is that the drop everything
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:27.180]   and love is often enforced by the faces of those
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.320]   that you love, they just show up
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.700]   in whatever space you happen to be in.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.440]   - Especially if you work from home.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.860]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:37.440]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.760]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.400]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.000]   to help you better understand your body
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.880]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.380]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.760]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.620]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.760]   and wellbeing can only be analyzed
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.960]   from a quality blood test.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.300]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.700]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.920]   is that you get information back about various levels
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.920]   of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.900]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.460]   Inside Tracker makes knowing what to do
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:10.060]   with all that information exceedingly easy.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.920]   They have a personalized platform
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.620]   that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course,
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:18.040]   but then also what sorts of behavioral dos and don'ts,
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.540]   what sorts of nutritional changes,
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.640]   what sorts of supplementation would allow you
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.380]   to bring those levels into the ranges
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.880]   that are optimal for you.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.260]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.920]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.460]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.500]   - Let's move on to the next one, shall we?
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.160]   Number three here is going to be what I call calendar
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.120]   or sort of time frame.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.380]   So it's going back a little bit and saying
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.700]   you've decided on this goal
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.920]   and you've identified the defenders.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.320]   Now we need to come up with a realistic time frame
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.200]   for how long it's going to take to accomplish that goal.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.640]   And when you do that,
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   you need to look at your life schedule.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.940]   And what I mean by that is,
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.960]   do you have important deadlines coming up?
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.240]   Do you have holiday?
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.840]   Do you have a trip?
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.140]   Do you have travel?
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.240]   Do your children have something coming up?
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.100]   You need to take all that information
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.480]   and I literally lay out a calendar
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.160]   and I write all those dates in a physical calendar first.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.600]   And the reason I'm suggesting this
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.080]   is you want to work your training backwards around that.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.680]   As we've been discussing, life will win.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.740]   If you try to plan a training program
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.680]   that is five days a week, 90 minutes a day,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.440]   and all of a sudden you look two weeks from now
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.420]   and you realize you've got a grant deadline
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.200]   and then you've got to take two days to go to Austin,
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.160]   it's just foolish.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.880]   You're going to fail and then you're going to quit
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.720]   and you're going to be like,
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.920]   "Man, again, my training program failed."
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.680]   So you need to figure out what are the non-negotiables
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.960]   are in that business quadrant
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.100]   and just not be foolish, all right?
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.000]   So let's imagine you're going to plot out
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.540]   say a 12-week training phase
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.240]   and you've decided on this goal.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.060]   And then you look and you realize
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.660]   in the middle of this 12-week span,
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:07.000]   week five is really hectic and chaotic.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.240]   Or you realize that this is a quarter
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.880]   in which something important is due.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.080]   Maybe we'll want to either adjust the goal
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.980]   or what we really do in this step
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:20.060]   is going on to actually step number four,
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:25.060]   which is choose the number of days per week you can exercise
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:29.160]   and the length in terms of amount of time
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.600]   you can truly afford to train.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.480]   I would rather you underestimate that than overestimate it.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.720]   So again, you look at the calendar,
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.400]   you put all these non-negotiables,
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.960]   the deadlines you cannot move in the calendar.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.520]   And then you say, "Look, based on this realistically,
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.040]   I can conservatively train three days a week
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.320]   for 60 minutes total.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.760]   And that includes the time I walk into the gym,
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.480]   my warmup, my down regulation, breathing at the end,
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.720]   and then me getting back either in the shower and back."
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.400]   'Cause really now it's maybe 90 minutes
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.240]   by the time you traveled, you transitioned,
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.560]   you picked back up on work, you showered, you ate, et cetera.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.920]   That time just runs away from you
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.480]   and all of a sudden it was a two and a half hour thing,
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.940]   even though it was a 45 minute workout.
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.660]   So you really need to figure that thing out.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.140]   If you're a few weeks in and you realize,
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.400]   "Oh, I actually have a little more time than I thought."
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.240]   You can always train more.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.240]   You can do another thing, you can add up.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.880]   But what you don't wanna do is set up a program
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.160]   that is requiring you to do certain exercises on one day
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.260]   or certain styles of training on another.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.920]   And then you constantly miss one of those days.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.880]   I thought I could do four days a week,
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.380]   but one day a week, something's getting pulled out.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.040]   That's just gonna keep you off schedule.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.800]   It's gonna make you feel like a failure
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.480]   and you're gonna run into problems with your training.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.120]   So schedule three, if you are sure you can get three
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.040]   and if there's an extra day,
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.080]   we can always do other fun stuff, right?
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.320]   So that's really step three and four.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.740]   Figure out your life events over the course of this time.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.680]   How many days a week can you train?
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.000]   And how long in terms of minutes per workout?
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.880]   Notice we haven't selected a single exercise yet.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.480]   We haven't worried about how heavy, rest intervals,
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.000]   all those modifiable variables.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.080]   You don't need to pick those later.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.040]   First, where are we going?
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.080]   Second, how are we going to get there?
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.180]   Which is the quadrant and identifying of defenders.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.920]   And then the third is what are the restrictions
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.400]   I need to place on myself in terms of program design
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.000]   based on how often and how long I can work out?
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.920]   That is going to allow you to go back
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.220]   to some of the previous episodes and go,
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.360]   man, you gave us all kinds of ideas.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.080]   How do I know which one to choose?
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.240]   This is your answer.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.600]   You're going to choose based upon the limitations
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.520]   of time and frequency.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.920]   So if you've already said, let's imagine we're in bucket A
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.800]   or bucket C, it doesn't matter.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.520]   And you go, look, the most I can afford with where I'm at
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.160]   with what's going on in my life is three days a week.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.780]   Well, we automatically know we're going to have
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.740]   to start choosing a training style
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.920]   that's limited to three days a week.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.360]   Don't even worry about the four or five days.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.000]   Those are off the table.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.040]   And so we've placed restrictions.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.880]   It kind of goes back to that concept of,
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.400]   I think it's one of your podcast guests, Jocko, right?
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.780]   It's just like, hey, structure gives us
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.160]   actually some freedom.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.480]   So by creating some restrictions here,
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.620]   we're a little more free to go,
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.880]   I only actually have to choose between A and B.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.320]   Rather than sitting down and going, man, there's all,
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.520]   I'm 20 hours into this exercise podcasting.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.800]   There's so many options between a pick.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.560]   Well, you create a little bit of restriction
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.880]   and now it's easier to go, oh, my only option is A or B.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.720]   And there we go.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.860]   - So that's number four.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.280]   That's three and four.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.380]   At that point, once we're good there,
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.520]   now what you want to do is go to step number five,
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.480]   which is actually select your exercises or your movements.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.160]   And this is going to be as simple as selecting
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:48.000]   like a kettlebell swing or running or swimming.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.480]   It could be your entire exercise mode.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.360]   And what you want to do with exercise selection here
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.420]   is make sure that you're balancing those exercises
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.360]   across the whole week,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.220]   not within necessarily every workout.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.800]   So if you have four days a week, five days a week,
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.700]   you want to look at the exercise selection and say,
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.940]   okay, I need to have somewhat of a reasonable balance
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:14.640]   between movement patterns or muscle groups
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.200]   or front and back, side to side,
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.680]   however you're thinking of it, just across that week.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.500]   So again, say we're on a three-day program
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.740]   and we're in either of the buckets,
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.040]   any of the buckets really,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.680]   and we say, okay, great, maybe it's not ideal
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.480]   if all I select is cycling every day.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.720]   That's not a lot of balance.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.640]   I don't notice any, there's no upper body work there.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.960]   There's no torso work.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.000]   There's no other position.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.400]   So maybe I'm going to really focus on cycling.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.300]   So I will do only cycling two days a week,
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.080]   but that third day I need to pick something
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.760]   for the other movement areas.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.900]   And that's going to make sure you stay
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.620]   in a reasonable balance.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.240]   If you have an exercise that you like, great.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.640]   If you have exercise you have access to.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.040]   Again, maybe the gym is a giant pain in the ass.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.020]   And so you can say, look, it's too far away.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.900]   The closest one is 45 minutes there and back.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.520]   So maybe I'm going to restrict myself
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.040]   to only kettlebell and bands and running
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.160]   'cause I can do those in my house.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.000]   Awesome.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.200]   We've actually created some freedom
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.000]   because we gave ourselves some restriction.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.160]   And now we just have to figure out
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.520]   how am I going to give some movement patterns
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.260]   somewhat balanced across my three days.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:23.200]   So really when it comes to exercise choice,
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.920]   it is selecting the patterns
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.360]   that you know how to execute,
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.840]   giving yourself again somewhat of a balance
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.440]   between the muscles and the joints
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.740]   and the movement patterns,
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:39.120]   making sure that you are specifically targeting
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.700]   any muscle group or movement that you want.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.040]   So making sure you want to improve muscle size
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:45.880]   in your glutes.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.760]   You better make sure some of the exercises you're doing
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.640]   at least one day a week,
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.600]   you feel it in your actual glutes.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.640]   So you can check that box.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.960]   It doesn't have to be every exercise.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.480]   It probably shouldn't.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.080]   It doesn't even have to be every single day.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.880]   But make sure it's checked off somewhere on that list.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.740]   And the last one is,
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:08.080]   is there a strategy in which you can progress it?
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.100]   So if you're like, I'm just going to do body weight exercises.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:10.940]   Okay, great.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.520]   Well, how are you going to progress those?
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.120]   In a case like body weight, it's really hard to add load.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.640]   Maybe you can put a weight vest on or something,
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.600]   but then maybe you don't have that
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.440]   or that's an extra thing or that can only go so far.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.400]   So what's my progression strategy going to be?
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.720]   Well, in this case, maybe you just increase the complexity
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.260]   by going from two legs, like say a body weight squat,
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.400]   to a single leg squat,
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.140]   or you just increase repetitions,
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.280]   or you increase time you're going to hold it.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.760]   My point is your progression strategy
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.440]   will be based upon the restrictions that you placed
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.080]   based on availability and things like that.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.860]   The last thing I would recommend here
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.920]   in terms of exercise progression,
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.340]   to make sure that you can continue to do these things
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.040]   while lowering your risk of injury,
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.800]   both in the short term and long term,
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.400]   is to progress your exercise complexity in this fashion.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.360]   So make sure, number one,
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.480]   you can do the exercise properly with assistance.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.800]   So let's imagine a scenario
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.480]   where we're going to try to squat.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.840]   So give yourself, put your hands on a bench
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.680]   or something like that.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.720]   Now, can you execute that squat perfectly with assistance?
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.880]   So you're holding onto something.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.720]   Okay, great.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.040]   If you can't, then don't progress past that.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.560]   Don't go now do a barbell back squat
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.840]   if you can't do it correctly when you had assistance.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.720]   But let's assume most people can do that.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.640]   Okay, great.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.100]   Now you can move on to the next step,
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.920]   which is can you do it well without assistance?
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.000]   So this would be body weight only.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.660]   Check, cool.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.500]   We're good there.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.700]   Okay, now you can go ahead and move on.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.000]   Can you do it well with an added eccentric load?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.600]   So in this particular case, if we're learning to squat,
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.240]   we can do it well when I hold onto something.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.080]   That's great.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.960]   Okay, now I can do it well with just my body weight.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.660]   Now, if I put a little bit of weight on,
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.360]   whether it's a kettlebell in the front like a goblet squat
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.880]   or dumbbells to the side or whatever you want to do,
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.600]   can I lower it and go all the way down
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.040]   and stay in perfect position?
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.560]   If you can do that, great.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.880]   You're allowed to go to the next step,
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.380]   which is can you hold it isometrically?
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.520]   So can you go all the way down
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.320]   and then hold that bottom position?
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.120]   What you don't want to do is start adding load or speed
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.480]   or fatigue if you're going down to the bottom position
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.240]   of the movement and you're out of control.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.320]   We really want to avoid this.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.260]   So I want you to show me you can go down
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:31.800]   and you can lower the weight under control.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.400]   You can hold it in that position under control.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.840]   If we're clear there,
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.460]   now we can add the concentric portion, right?
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:43.500]   You can now go ahead, you can lower it,
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.680]   you can hold that position of most danger,
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.040]   now you can move up at whatever speed we want.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.200]   We are all good there.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.760]   Once you can show me those things,
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.960]   you can add the last two steps,
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.320]   which are now speed if you choose to,
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.880]   and the last one, which is fatigue, right?
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.920]   I would really discourage people
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.960]   from doing exercises to fatigue,
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.760]   especially with a moderate or high load,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.480]   unless you can promise me you can do these first six steps.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.520]   If you can, you can basically go hog wild
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.540]   with your training and your chances of injury are very low.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:19.480]   Again, both acute injury, as well as long-term injury,
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.560]   which is just sort of like my joints ache
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.280]   and all of a sudden my shoulder hurts
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.300]   and things like that.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.200]   That's really what I'm looking for.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.080]   And once you're clear there, you can train pretty hard.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.940]   - I really like this because recently I was showing somebody
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.700]   how to use a, in this case, it was a hack squat machine.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.840]   I noticed that they were very timid
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.000]   of getting into a deep squat position.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.840]   And they cited a previous knee injury,
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.520]   which is long since healed.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.360]   - Right.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.280]   - But even with proper foot placement and everything,
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.160]   you just tell they were getting ginger about it
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.960]   as they approached that bottom position.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:58.120]   But over time, with pauses at the bottom,
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.480]   they become very comfortable.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.440]   And now actually are going well below 90 degrees angle
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.840]   between femur and lower leg.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.360]   So it was clear that it wasn't something
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.440]   range of motion limited, or it was just,
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.000]   it was a mental thing, but a logical one for them.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.420]   Now, after what you just said,
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.960]   I think a better strategy that I could have used
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:25.120]   would have been to have them get into that position,
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.840]   just no weight at all, maybe nothing on the sled,
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.580]   and then slowly working up from there,
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.620]   as opposed to doing what we did in our case,
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.460]   which was to just convince them
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.680]   that they were much stronger than they thought they were.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:38.600]   We eventually got there,
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.000]   but I'm realizing that there was far too much
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.920]   mental anguish involved in that process.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.160]   - Yeah, this whole progression, by the way,
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.800]   this can all happen in one session.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.080]   If you can check the boxes, like in that example,
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.760]   you may have been fine to jump there.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.880]   It may have just been a, hey, you're fine here,
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.280]   get through it, oh, okay.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.840]   This whole progression might take two years.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.880]   I mean, this really depends on your background,
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.440]   if you actually have injury history,
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.300]   your comfort, your confidence, like all these things.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.520]   So you don't need to worry
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.160]   about rushing through that progression.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.420]   You don't even need to get all the way to the end,
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.480]   if you don't want, especially with speed
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.800]   and things like that.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.120]   But again, it can't happen.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.960]   It doesn't have to be like, well, it's a month of this,
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.720]   a month, like, but no, if they feel great
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.800]   and you can go through one to seven in five minutes,
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.520]   then you're good to go.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.400]   - Number six.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.520]   - Number six now is just order.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.600]   So you know how many days per week you're gonna work out.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.540]   You know how long they're going to take.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:31.280]   You've selected all the exercises you need to get done.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.120]   You've balanced that across the week.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.680]   Now you just need to put them in order.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.440]   And the easy answer here is generally,
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.580]   do what's most important first in the workout.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:45.040]   There is some minor interference effect
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.560]   or some other things there, but the reality of it is,
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.840]   if you do the priority first,
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.980]   you're probably going to be okay.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.800]   So whether this priority is a muscle group,
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.680]   so in the example, you wanna make sure
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.500]   your glutes get trained, maybe do it first.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.180]   If you're trying to maximize your back squat,
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.580]   you may not wanna do a bunch of glute exercises
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.620]   to fatigue first, but that's not the priority we picked.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.580]   We picked a different one, which is buckets A, B, and C.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:14.740]   Okay, great.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.620]   By doing it first, you told me the priority
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.820]   was to make sure I do something for my glutes.
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.200]   And then I would also like to get my back squat
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.120]   a little bit stronger or whatever.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.060]   Okay, fine.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.600]   The same thing could be done for your endurance training.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.700]   You could do your endurance training before your lifting
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.800]   if you understand that that means you might be compromising
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.740]   your lifting quality of the workout a little bit.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:37.680]   But you might be fine with that
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.340]   if you say the endurance work is more important right now.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.180]   Amazing.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.100]   You don't know the answer to that, though,
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.860]   if you hadn't gone through steps one through four.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.400]   And that's why those things are critical.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.380]   So it makes what we call chaos management,
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.940]   which is things happen in the moment.
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.780]   I don't know what to do.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.860]   What should I choose?
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:55.500]   That decision becomes really clear
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.980]   'cause you can always go back to the beginning
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:59.640]   and go, my priority was this.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.940]   Then therefore, that's my choice today.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.640]   So it provides a very simple set of instructions
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.820]   for when the workout gets cut short,
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.580]   when your workout has to be in a hotel
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:12.840]   and any number of things that pop up in real life,
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.680]   whether again, you're an athlete or non-athlete,
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.560]   either way, life will get in the way at some point.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.740]   So you need to have rules and a system that says,
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.920]   when this happens, I go right back to this
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.060]   and that's my choice.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.540]   Done, I'm moving on.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:27.680]   No decision to make here.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.960]   It's already been determined a week ago, five weeks ago.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.140]   We're off and rolling.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:34.380]   So the order again is pretty simple.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.380]   Just put the one that is most important first.
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:41.700]   Now I know you like to do legs on Monday.
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:42.580]   That's great.
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:43.580]   I actually love that too.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.620]   I do the same thing generally
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.780]   because to me that's almost always the most important thing.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:51.960]   If I miss a bicep workout, I'm probably fine,
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.380]   but I really don't like missing the big movement pattern.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.940]   So I make sure that those happen on a day
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.440]   that tend to be more stable for me.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.780]   Mondays are generally pretty stable.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.240]   Things get chaotic as the week moves along for me.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.460]   Others might be the opposite, right?
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.840]   Others might wanna go, hey,
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.720]   I'm actually gonna keep Monday as my flexible day
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:13.300]   or off day because I like to get a lot of my work done,
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.420]   get that cleared so I can have, oh sure,
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.300]   like working around you.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.980]   Some people love to train on Saturdays
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:18.820]   'cause it's their most free.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.220]   Some people hate it.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.760]   Sure, you tell me what is the biggest priority
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.060]   and when are you the most fresh?
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.500]   Monday, Tuesday, it doesn't matter.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.600]   Depends on your work schedule.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.780]   Maybe you work the weekends, I don't know, right?
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.240]   You decide what day of the week
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.640]   are you generally the most consistent,
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.140]   the most consistent schedule and the most consistent energy
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:41.060]   and do the thing that is most important on that day.
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:43.840]   It doesn't matter Monday, Tuesday, day one, day three.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.360]   We were sort of talking about this earlier,
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.300]   but you actually don't even have to do a week schedule.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:51.180]   Our brains tend to like to go year, month, week,
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:53.420]   but a lot of folks will even just run this thing
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:55.380]   in terms of like a seven or nine day schedule.
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.280]   In fact, we ran a nine day training schedule
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.560]   for one of my major league baseball players
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.320]   and he's eight or so years into his career
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.360]   and he's hitting all time PRs in velocity.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.200]   He's very, very good.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.660]   And it was a nine day training cycle
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.340]   and we ran that for the entire season.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:15.760]   So it doesn't have to be a seven day split,
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.300]   but it tends to work for a lot of people
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.220]   'cause most people have a fairly consistent schedule
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:21.140]   across the seven days.
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.620]   So pick the thing that is most important and do it first
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.980]   and do it on the day of the week
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:26.740]   that is most consistent for you
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.060]   in terms of schedule and energy.
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:31.080]   I really like what you're describing.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.240]   I should just say that one of the reasons
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.820]   I put legs on Monday is because I tend to get enough sleep
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.660]   on the weekends.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.540]   I generally get enough sleep during the middle of the week,
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.880]   but oftentimes things will come up.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:44.400]   I can be pretty sure, however, that I've quote unquote
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.920]   caught up on my sleep on the weekends.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.160]   This notion of catching up on sleep
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.520]   is a little dicey scientifically,
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.200]   but tend to be pretty rested by Monday morning.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.340]   And actually my week begins on Sunday
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.860]   and Sundays are when I get my long form cardio.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:59.300]   So those two are really non-negotiable.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.820]   And the reason that long form cardio is on Sunday
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:04.080]   is that it can take many different forms.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.220]   It can take a hike with a weighted vest.
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.360]   It can take the form of a jog.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.560]   It can be done with other people.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.560]   It can be family time.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.220]   It can be time with friends and so on.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.400]   And that's pretty hard to do
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.700]   during the middle of the week,
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.900]   or pretty hard to ensure, at least for me.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.060]   I also find that by bookending the week
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:24.820]   with some non-negotiable days of training on Sunday, Monday,
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.300]   then if the week gets busy Tuesday, Wednesday,
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.260]   or even sometimes Thursday with travel and things like that,
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.220]   one can sort of catch up toward the weekend.
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.180]   It's not ideal.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.860]   I mean, ideally it's spaced out,
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.020]   but really this isn't about what I do.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:39.460]   This is really just to underscore the principle you described
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.020]   which is I have a very clear sense now
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.100]   over three decades or so of training
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:48.020]   and three decades or so of being involved
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.340]   in academics and science and work
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.580]   of when I tend to be most rested,
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:55.120]   when I tend to have some flexibility in my schedule,
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.540]   and also when I'm trying to combine fitness
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:00.060]   with some of my social engagements,
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.260]   which is actually quite fun.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.180]   One thing I noticed that the four boxes
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.020]   that you mentioned before,
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:07.400]   work relationships, fitness, and recovery,
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.020]   some of them do have some crossover.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:09.860]   - They all do.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.380]   - You know, a hike with family or friends
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.460]   is both relationship and fitness and so on.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:18.040]   But I love the principle
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.040]   because anything that can add consistency,
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.160]   as you pointed it out,
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.620]   is going to greatly increase the probability
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:24.480]   of reaching one's goals.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.980]   That's sort of an obvious one.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:28.500]   But in an earlier episode,
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.260]   you also said something that I wrote down
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.700]   and is really still ringing in my mind,
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:32.540]   especially now,
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:35.780]   which is that consistency always beats intensity.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.020]   - Correct.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:38.300]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.780]   We used to do a thing
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:43.780]   when I was training NFL players for the combine
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.200]   many years ago,
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.260]   where Saturdays were supposed to be the day they came in
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:51.280]   and we did the most regeneration.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.280]   So this is when they get bodywork done
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.480]   and we do hot, cold contrast
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.800]   and sort of all these things.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.220]   And our attendance was like 1%.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.060]   Nobody showed up, right?
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.300]   - For a massage?
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.140]   - Nobody showed up.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:03.980]   - Wow.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.220]   - Seems right, but remember.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:06.420]   - I love a good massage.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.300]   - Of course.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.740]   But remember, you're 18 years old.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.840]   You're likely to be getting millions of dollars
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.220]   handed to you in the next few weeks or months.
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.060]   And--
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.160]   - He's not referring to me, by the way.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.000]   - No, no, no.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.940]   He's actually quite a bit older than 18.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.540]   And I'm not getting handed millions of dollars each week.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:25.180]   - Right.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.940]   So I would think that,
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:29.220]   but those folks like they recover super fast.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.240]   They've never really had that.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.100]   And also like Friday night, kind of enticing.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.300]   And so nothing was there.
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.260]   And the strategy then was what if we,
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:43.260]   instead of having a important hard training day on Saturday,
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:47.520]   we transition and it is only things they want to do.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.880]   So we basically identified,
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.180]   what are the things in training you love the most?
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.740]   And let's do those Saturdays.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.020]   And it turns out for those folks, no surprise here,
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.940]   it was what we call the gun show.
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.580]   So they would come into the gym
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:01.820]   and we would literally do nothing but biceps and triceps.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:02.760]   They'd just get a pump.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.380]   And then the deal was though,
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:05.820]   you come in and literally would come in
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.640]   as we would pick three guys.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.820]   So you, you and you.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.500]   You pick your favorite bicep exercise.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.420]   You pick your favorite one.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.400]   You pick your favorite one.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.240]   You three over there,
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.900]   you pick your favorite tricep, tricep, tricep.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:15.900]   And we just run a big circuit.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.640]   Like it's just like, how many reps?
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.480]   I don't know.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.320]   I don't care how many reps.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.140]   I don't even care.
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:20.980]   Just like pump away.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.240]   Like I don't even care, right?
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.240]   We chose small muscle groups.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.720]   It's not really gonna interfere with much.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.200]   We're training them for the NFL combine,
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.040]   which is like, it's not a,
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.820]   it's legs performance basically, right?
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:31.660]   So it was like,
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.800]   if they smash their biceps and triceps on a Saturday,
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:36.320]   it's not gonna influence what we did on Monday.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320]   So recovery wasn't an issue.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.160]   Once we finished the gun show though,
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.940]   now you have to go do your regen stuff.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.480]   So if you need chiro work,
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.560]   you need physical therapy,
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.680]   whatever you're gonna do.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.820]   So we would get them in the building
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.480]   with the low hanging fruit.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.580]   And then we would actually get them to do their work.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:53.560]   You can do the same thing.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.820]   And I honestly do the same thing.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.000]   I tend to do either,
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.700]   if I'm gonna do an upper lower split,
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:03.980]   I'm gonna do that stuff either Friday night or Saturday,
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.740]   because it's very difficult for me
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:09.680]   to do a hard long workout Friday night, right?
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.040]   Or even Friday morning for that matter.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:11.880]   The same thing Saturday,
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.700]   I wake up and it's now it's like,
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.220]   it's family mode, it's kid things.
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:16.060]   I wanna do stuff.
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:19.100]   I want, man, but I can usually convince myself
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.240]   to be like, all right, just go in there,
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.620]   go 20 minutes and get your upper body stuff done.
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.980]   All right, I can walk myself into that mentally.
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.180]   It's harder to walk yourself
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.600]   into your five sets of five deadlift.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.740]   It's sorta just like, whoa,
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.120]   I ain't got that in me right now.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.840]   My high intensity intervals, the max of,
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.140]   I don't have that right now.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:38.380]   So I'll either go for my long steady state stuff,
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.620]   which is like, I'm gonna, I'm going on the bike,
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:43.800]   I'm riding down to the beach or coming back nasal only.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.820]   I can get myself to go for a bike ride like that or whatever.
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:50.580]   So I picked the thing that I'm likely to do on the days
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.280]   where I'm probably gonna be my weakest quote unquote,
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.680]   not physically, but motivation wise.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.520]   For a long time, I tried to like,
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.800]   it just got stuck in a way where my harder stuff
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.440]   was Friday nights.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.740]   And I'm just like, why am I doing this?
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.200]   I was having like a 50% success rate,
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.540]   just like we were having like a no percent success rate
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:10.080]   with the NFL guys on Saturday.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.140]   So you have to be a little bit tough.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.560]   You have to grind sometimes,
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.860]   you have to get some motivation, go after it.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.200]   But you also have to be like,
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.680]   well, this is just stupid planning, right?
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.160]   Like why put yourself in a position
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.680]   where you're just failing over and over and over
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:27.280]   when I could move it and go, look,
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.120]   those sessions are going to be things that are easier.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.020]   They don't require as much gusto to get up
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:35.960]   and get them done.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.920]   I get those things done 90% of the time.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.320]   'Cause the worst case I can be like,
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.560]   all right, we're gonna go do a family thing,
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.400]   give me 20 minutes,
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.040]   I'm just gonna run up there and smash the upper body.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.600]   And you don't need, I don't need a 20 minute warmup.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.880]   It's like, I can just kind of jump into those things
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.780]   if I had to.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:54.160]   If I feel great, then I can still go do something else
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.000]   or I could do more, I could do a longer session.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.760]   But you're sort of immune to any situation.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.200]   So I would bookend those, I guess is what I'm saying.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.020]   What's the day you're gonna have the best day
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:05.820]   and what's the day you generally have the worst?
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:10.240]   And put the programs around those situations.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.720]   - I love the idea of identifying the friction points,
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.340]   the high friction and low friction days.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.880]   Friction meaning anything that impedes you
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:18.100]   from training consistently or well.
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.920]   And there are so many factors that ratchet into that sleep.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.200]   Other social engagements work.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.800]   Friday night, I also find it tough
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.880]   to do any kind of training.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.040]   I do cardiovascular training.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.960]   I do interval type training on Fridays typically.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.880]   But there's a lot of cumulative fatigue and stress
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.280]   that happens across the week.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.960]   And usually for a long time, gosh, more than a decade now,
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.720]   I've been telling myself that Saturday is the day
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.280]   that I try to reduce my cortisol
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.200]   as much as possible from the week.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.760]   And then Sunday is the day that I enjoy
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.040]   that low cortisol state.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:56.440]   And that's actually what opened up into the long slow run.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.320]   I actually like to think of myself as a bit of a mule
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.080]   during those long runs.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.200]   I actually have a shirt that has a sloth on it
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.020]   that I wear to remind myself to go slowly on those runs.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.380]   Not that I ever run that fast,
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.780]   but there's the whole mindset around it
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:15.960]   is to be a bit of a mule, just kind of moving through it.
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.440]   And the fatigue factor is more one of,
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.760]   at first there's a little bit of boredom,
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.460]   but then I've noticed there's a whole different set
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.880]   of mental escapes that open up
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.400]   under different training types.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.460]   And this is maybe something we get into a little bit
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:31.240]   in a future episode or discussion.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.520]   When you train really intensely for short periods of time,
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.680]   one way, your mind goes into a particular state
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.380]   when you do long duration training,
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:41.240]   your thinking and indeed even the way
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.300]   it affects sleep patterns is also very different.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.440]   I think one of the great futures for neuroscience
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.200]   and exercise science and collaboration
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.640]   is to identify how different patterns of physical movement
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.860]   relate to different patterns of thinking and vice versa.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.320]   Anyway, that's something maybe to just earmark
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.720]   for a future conversation,
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.580]   but there's clearly a relationship there.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:00.420]   - Yeah.
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.360]   Yeah, well, when we certainly know
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.660]   of a pretty clear relationship
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:08.760]   between even what we would classify as zone five exercise
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.760]   and deep sleep.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.760]   - So a zone five, again, being,
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.000]   you're breathing a lot through your mouth
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.040]   because you have to in order to bring in enough oxygen
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.200]   to offset the acidity created by the carbon.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.040]   Exactly.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.280]   - Yeah, this is the high heart rate.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.640]   So, I mean, if you're going to look at it and hit a number,
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:29.280]   looking for something like 30 plus minutes a week,
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.480]   being in the top 10% of your heart rate.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.120]   - That impacts deep sleep.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.080]   - Is going to positively impact deep sleep.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.740]   As long as it's done very far away from deep sleep.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.400]   So you don't want to do that at night.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.020]   So in terms of time.
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.600]   So if you hit those numbers earlier in the day,
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.000]   oftentimes that will enhance deep sleep.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.820]   - Yeah, I was looking at some papers recently
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:52.820]   and the number that kind of emerged from those papers
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:56.620]   was that unless it's low intensity exercise,
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:32:01.240]   trying to exercise about six hours or more away
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.300]   from your sleep time would be ideal.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:06.240]   Now that said, for those of you that have to hit the gym
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.600]   or go for a run in the evening
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.060]   and then are trying to fall asleep four to six hours later,
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.860]   I wouldn't want that statement to impede
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:16.120]   your regular exercising.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.020]   - Yeah, there's an easy trick to that.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:20.520]   Just finish it with down regulation breathing.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.340]   So that's sort of one of our things that if you,
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:25.080]   'cause that is a realistic situation, right?
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.940]   - Finish work at five or even six,
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:29.180]   and then by the time you're training or running
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.700]   or whatever you want to call it, it's a 738,
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.380]   you're home at nine, you're eating,
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:34.220]   and then everyone's like,
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.480]   you can't eat two hours before bed.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.020]   Pretty soon you run into a number
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.500]   of different collision points
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.440]   that make you wonder whether or not
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.500]   you're doing everything wrong
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.860]   or if it's really worth training at all.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:45.020]   And I would argue it's better to train than not to train,
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.100]   provided that you can still get to sleep.
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:49.040]   - 100%, so you have to walk a little bit of a game.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.300]   We run into this issue with the NBA players, right?
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.180]   You're playing games at six o'clock at night at start.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:57.180]   Major League Baseball is a 705, 710 pitch, right?
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:58.020]   And also by the way,
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.860]   we're changing time zones every five days, right?
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.420]   UFC fighters and such, we're usually training twice a day.
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:05.880]   There is no option to train.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.420]   Well, I mean, we are training twice a day always.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.740]   So we have to come up with strategies for that.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.140]   And there's other like non-athlete scenarios, of course,
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.380]   where it's like, there is no other option here, cool.
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:17.600]   So what we do is a couple of things.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.740]   Number one, the further away you can make it from sleep,
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.580]   the better, if possible.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:24.480]   We do need to train though,
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.260]   around the same time you're going to be playing.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:28.340]   That has to happen.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:31.900]   So the harder and longer we go in the training session,
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.560]   the harder and longer we go
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.780]   in our down-regulation post-exercise.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:38.300]   And that is, in my estimation,
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:42.820]   the number one lever you can pull that can help, right?
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.380]   Now, if it really does start crushing sleep,
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:49.260]   you're going to have to make a critical decision there.
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:53.460]   In general, it's not a good reason to not exercise,
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:57.140]   but maybe you restrict to only a couple of days a week,
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:59.000]   you go all the way up in intensity,
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.360]   and the rest of the days, maybe 70%.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.300]   You stay in just kind of a working zone.
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.500]   Awesome.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.160]   Maybe it's a longer down-regulation,
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.260]   maybe there's other strategies you can do.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:12.260]   But yeah, you want to be careful of,
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:14.400]   and we've had this situation a number of times
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.460]   where it's sort of just like sleep complaints,
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.280]   sleep complaints, sleep complaints.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.020]   We run full sleep studies on them in their house.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.300]   We do the whole thing with absolute rest.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:25.900]   We come in, we do the whole thing, eye tracking,
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.940]   biomarkers, the whole thing.
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:29.660]   And it's like, oh,
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:32.180]   you just need to stop doing intervals at 8 p.m.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.220]   - Right, and I would add to that,
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.460]   another incentive for being able to train
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.740]   with or without caffeine is that it's very clear
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:42.300]   that even if you can fall asleep after ingesting caffeine
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.060]   within the preceding hours,
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:47.980]   that caffeine consumed in the, gosh, even 12,
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:51.180]   but really eight to 10 hours, four hours prior to bedtime
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.080]   really disrupts the architecture of sleep.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.640]   So if you critically rely on caffeine in order to train,
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.560]   whatever your training might be,
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.420]   and you know that sleep is important for recovery,
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.660]   well, then it's pretty obvious where I'm going with this.
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:06.160]   So having that flexibility is vitally important.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.460]   - Yeah, you've probably also covered this,
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.900]   but you can actually measure that directly.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:12.440]   So by eye tracking patterns,
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.940]   you can actually identify the effects
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.560]   that caffeine has on sleep
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.200]   independent of a sleep time or not.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.840]   - Right, there are never positive effects.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.280]   - Correct.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:26.180]   - That said, I am a proponent of caffeine early in the day,
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.220]   and caffeine does have a lot of, well,
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:33.220]   it's anti-neurodegenerative.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:34.880]   As long as you're not getting anxiety,
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.860]   it's pro-performance, both mental and physical performance.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:39.660]   But of course, if you do not need caffeine,
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:41.920]   if you're one of these mutants that do not need caffeine
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.580]   in order to go about your daily living
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:45.840]   with focus and intensity,
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.540]   then by all means, don't start taking caffeine.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.000]   - I'm not the hugest fan.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.640]   I am scientifically, 100% I'm bored personally.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.880]   I don't do well on it.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.780]   - Well, you seem to ride a little bit more
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:58.480]   of what we would call sympathetic tone,
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.320]   kind of shifted towards more alert.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   I tend to be naturally a bit more like my Bulldog Costello
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.520]   was a little bit more on the mellow sleepy side.
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.320]   And caffeine just puts me right at that alert
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.480]   but calm place.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.280]   And I can get away with drinking it.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.000]   I wouldn't say ridiculous,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.720]   but a fair amount of caffeine and remain there.
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.040]   But I do restrict it until the time right up about 2 p.m.
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:24.080]   at the latest is really when I'm trying to drink caffeine.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.120]   Number seven.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.520]   - Great, so number seven and eight are pretty simple.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:31.340]   This is now choose the intensity and the volume.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:35.200]   So we've discussed those at length in the previous episodes.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.760]   We probably don't have the time to go back
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.000]   over all those details.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.200]   So remember the adaptation you're training for
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.120]   and pick the appropriate rep range, total amount of sets,
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.680]   as well as the intensity to then get
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.940]   the corresponding adaptation, right?
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:52.080]   All you have to do is select those things.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.940]   In terms of progression through a week,
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.140]   the rule of thumb we say for intensity
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:01.560]   is something around 3% per week, right?
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.400]   For volume, it will depend on what you're doing
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   a little bit, but anytime you cross more than 10% per week,
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.520]   you're going to start running into problems.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.360]   So I like 5% better.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.600]   It doesn't need to be as low as three.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.300]   You can jump up much more than that.
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:18.680]   Five to 7% is better.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.960]   So if you are doing, say running,
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:25.140]   because the numbers make it easy,
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:27.520]   and you're doing 10 miles per week total.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.580]   If you were to go up to 11 miles the next week, great.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:33.640]   You're right around 10%.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.680]   But what you wouldn't want to do
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.960]   is say I'm running 10 miles this week.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.960]   And I did maybe four, Monday three, Wednesday three Friday.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.480]   So four, three, and three, you got your 10.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.240]   Then you wouldn't want to add a mile every day.
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.940]   So Monday, instead of doing four, I did five.
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:52.280]   Wednesday, instead of doing three, I did four.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.520]   Friday, instead of doing three, I did four.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.160]   What you actually did is you went from 10 to 13,
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.720]   which is a much higher percent jump than the 10% prescribed.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.600]   So the same thing would be true for lifting weights.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.600]   The same thing is actually true for calories
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.320]   and trying to add them, et cetera.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:09.640]   So the body tends to not handle those things as well,
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:12.320]   jumping more than 10% per week.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.720]   So keeping with this idea of increasing progressive overload
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:20.120]   being 10% more over some period of time,
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.360]   am I correct in assuming that I want to identify
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.440]   one, maybe two meaningful variables
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.600]   and progressing that or those variables?
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.780]   - So progressive overload can come in the form
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:33.840]   of any of the modifiable variables.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.160]   So you could increase the complexity of the movement.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.760]   You could increase the intensity or the load.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:43.080]   You can increase the volume by either more sets,
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:46.500]   more reps or more total exercises in a day.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.820]   - What about time under tension?
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.860]   - You could also manipulate the tempo of each repetition.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:55.220]   You could also manipulate how many times per day you train.
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:57.020]   So you can manipulate frequency.
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:59.980]   You can also manipulate rest intervals.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:03.700]   So you can progressively load any of these things,
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:07.380]   increase intensity, run a little bit faster,
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:11.120]   complete the same amount of work slightly faster,
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:14.500]   put 5% more on the barbell or the load or the handle
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.340]   or whatever you're gonna do.
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:16.440]   That's a simple way.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.860]   If you want to think about volume,
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:20.040]   in the case of endurance work is simple,
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.540]   mileage, time, whatever.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.840]   In the case of lifting, all you have to do
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.880]   is take the amount of repetitions you're doing per set,
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.020]   multiply it by the sets, add that all up.
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:35.140]   So if you're doing three sets of 10, that's 30 repetitions.
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:38.100]   If you did three exercises, you just did 90 repetitions.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:39.420]   Put that number down for Monday,
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.780]   put that number down for Wednesday,
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:43.580]   put that number down for Friday, add that total up.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.900]   So say you did 90, 90, 90.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:46.740]   You would look and say,
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.000]   my total number of repetitions this week is 270.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.020]   If I wanna go up 5%,
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:57.260]   then I need to go up another 15 or so total repetitions.
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.780]   Great, that's all we have to do.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.600]   That's the increase.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.700]   You may keep the load exactly the same,
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:05.020]   keep the exercises the same chain, nothing else,
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:08.940]   but you wanna add 15 more total reps for your week.
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.200]   And you may choose to do that
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.580]   by adding one more repetition per set.
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:14.260]   Close enough.
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.620]   So last week I did three sets of 10,
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:18.300]   this week I'm going to three sets of 11.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.980]   It can be as simple as that.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.300]   Again, it can be complex.
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.120]   I walked you through,
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.920]   it can be any of the modifiable variables,
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.560]   but the progression I just laid out is fairly simple
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.540]   and it's honestly the one I recommend for most people
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.180]   just because it will avoid confusion
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:34.260]   and it will avoid people taking massive leaps in volume.
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:37.960]   So the typical strategy I would recommend here
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.200]   is increasing load or intensity
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.020]   or a little bit of a combination slowly
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:48.340]   for about six or so weeks
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.800]   and then taking what we generally call a deload.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.700]   So back down to maybe 70%,
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:55.900]   whatever that number is you've been doing.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:57.500]   So you did three sets of 10
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:01.220]   and you worked yourself all the way up to three sets of 15.
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:04.540]   Back that down and maybe we'll do two sets of eight
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.580]   for the week.
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.820]   And then we'll come back the following week
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:09.820]   and go back and do the highest we've done.
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:12.460]   Now all of a sudden we're going to do four sets of 12
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.380]   or something like that.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:17.260]   So if you get these little deloads every,
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:20.000]   depending on what you're doing, four to eight weeks or so,
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.220]   you should be in a spot where you can continually progress
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.460]   for a very long time without either burning out
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:28.360]   or overloading and overstressing an injury pattern.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:32.720]   So the simple way, pick intensity or volume
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.500]   and just go up slightly every week
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.560]   for a short span of time, generally around six weeks.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.380]   And then you come back and change your strategy
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:40.440]   if you'd like.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.960]   - Because you mentioned sets and repetitions here,
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.540]   just wanted to remind folks that in the episode
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:48.740]   that we did on strength and hypertrophy,
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.640]   and that also included speed,
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.400]   there was a description of a terrific program for strength,
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.080]   which is the three by five program
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.560]   or three to five program as it's called,
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:02.040]   which is to select three to five exercises performed
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:05.840]   for three to five repetitions, three to five times per week
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.120]   with three to five minutes rest in between those exercises.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.380]   - For three to five sets.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.540]   - And if I recall correctly,
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:15.600]   the protocol for generating hypertrophy muscle growth
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.960]   is to perform a minimum of 10 and probably more like 15
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.120]   to 20 sets per muscle group per week.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.600]   And that can be done in a single session per muscle per week
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.000]   so one could train for instance,
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.680]   quadriceps one day per week
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:34.480]   as long as you're getting that volume of sets per week,
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:36.520]   or it could be divided up across two
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.600]   or three different sessions
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.000]   for that individual muscle group.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.760]   Of course, people are going to target
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.560]   all their major muscle groups
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:46.080]   and hopefully some of them minor muscle groups as well.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.140]   And as I recall, the number of repetitions
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.520]   that can generate hypertrophy is quite broad,
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.780]   anywhere from six repetitions
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:53.200]   all the way up to 30 repetitions,
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.400]   but by the end of the set,
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.920]   it should be two failure or close to failure with good form.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.760]   Is that correct?
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.560]   - Yeah, and we would say close to failure
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.680]   is probably most appropriate.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.920]   You can actually reach failure
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.640]   maybe on a few of the sets, maybe the end,
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.100]   and probably best to choose that
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:17.280]   with the exercises that are safer.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.420]   Not that any exercise is particularly unsafe
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:21.080]   if you do it appropriately,
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.360]   but you may not want to go to true failure on every set
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:30.360]   for the more complex, larger, riskier exercises.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.640]   So, pretty close to failure, but not all the way.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.440]   - And I realize I forgot to mention
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.200]   rest intervals between sets.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:43.080]   It follows that if a large range of repetitions
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.060]   are performed, that a large range of rest intervals
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:49.800]   are allowed, meaning there could be rest intervals
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:52.160]   between sets of as low as 30 seconds between sets
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.040]   or as high of two or three minutes,
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.240]   depending on the loads that one is using.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.380]   And that, of course, will scale
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:59.660]   with the number of repetitions.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:00.500]   - Excellent.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.060]   In fact, that sort of leads me into step number nine
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:06.080]   of designing your own training program,
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.560]   which is you've decided our goal.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.960]   We've worked our calendar out.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.000]   We've figured out how many days per week
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.560]   and how long we're gonna work out in those sessions.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.400]   We then went and selected our exercises.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.720]   We balanced them across the movement patterns
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:20.520]   and the muscle groups that we need
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.960]   so we're not causing excessive stress
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:26.660]   on the same exact joint or muscle group over time.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.980]   We then ordered our exercises based on priority.
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:33.080]   Because of that, we have identified our goal.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.760]   We went back and we selected the volume,
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.640]   which is the repetitions per set,
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.380]   the total amount of sets, and the load per set
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:42.480]   that matched the goal that we wanted to get
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.720]   or the adaptation.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.160]   Now all we have to do is fill in the rest intervals,
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.200]   which reflect back again the goal.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.560]   So generally, higher rest intervals,
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.040]   which means time that you rest between your sets.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.840]   Higher, somewhere between two to five minutes
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.280]   for things like speed, power, and strength.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.120]   Perhaps a little bit lower, although as you mentioned,
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.280]   it could also stay high for hypertrophy.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.440]   And then for endurance, you follow the rest interval
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.440]   that reflects the type of endurance training
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.240]   that you'd like to get.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.320]   That's walked us through one through nine.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.160]   We're almost done.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.800]   We've put together a pretty nice little protocol.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.320]   It should be well-rounded.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.160]   It should be effective.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.040]   We've also talked about how to progress it
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.720]   from week to week, keeping it within, again,
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:27.560]   four to six weeks, maybe up to eight,
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.000]   before we then take a back off.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.760]   The very last thing we have to do
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.080]   to make sure this training program is customized to you,
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.380]   your goal, and your situation,
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:39.560]   which is then going to enhance your likelihood
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.680]   of adherence and consistency,
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.200]   as well as increase the likelihood of effectiveness,
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.520]   is we just have to do a little bit
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.320]   of what we call chaos management,
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.400]   which is take a quick moment to think through,
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:55.740]   this program looks great, but if I had to nitpick it,
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:58.720]   where are the possible chances of failure?
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.240]   And you just want to sort of think about
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.800]   where would I predict things would go wrong?
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:07.360]   And if anything pops out to you,
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:10.600]   try to come up with your solution at the beginning.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.080]   And this could be a number of things.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:15.140]   So maybe you've picked an exercise and you realize,
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.600]   man, I really actually don't like that exercise.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.280]   Or maybe you look at the schedule now
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.440]   that it's laid out in front of you,
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:23.380]   you look at your work schedule and you're like,
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:25.280]   ah, maybe that's a bit aggressive.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:27.440]   I don't know, it could be any number of things,
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.060]   but it is a useful exercise
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:31.440]   to just think through everything realistically.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.840]   I typically just like,
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:35.240]   it's the adage I teach my graduate students,
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.080]   before we hit submit, we're going to sleep.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.560]   So it's there, it's ready, we're going to take 12 hours,
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.720]   we're going to wake up the next day,
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:44.760]   look at it again and go, are we sure we're good here?
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:46.800]   Yep, make adjustments if you need.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.200]   If not, if you feel confident,
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.620]   then hit send and cross your fingers.
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:53.680]   - Yeah, we were referring to submitting the manuscript.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.360]   It's interesting you say that I have a statement
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.700]   that I always make to people in my lab.
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:01.540]   They hit submit and now I say that you realize
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:02.700]   you're going to wake up tomorrow morning,
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:04.460]   there's going to be an email in your inbox
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:06.140]   that something was formatted incorrectly
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:07.520]   and you're going to spend tomorrow
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.880]   reformatting and submitting again.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:13.320]   So I've also learned that every project
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.160]   is actually two projects.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.920]   - I'm sorry, I'm trying to not die over here
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:16.760]   and interrupt you.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.600]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.940]   I've done this enough times,
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:21.440]   I've done this many dozens of times.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.240]   And then there's also another truism of science,
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.800]   which is that there's the project,
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.640]   there's a scientific question
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.660]   and then the paper is yet another project.
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:32.320]   And I actually think this is an analogy
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.980]   that carries over to other domains of life.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.040]   I think that anytime we take on something,
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.600]   if we want to write a book or we want to get a degree
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.640]   or we want to run a fitness program,
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:44.120]   I think it's worth thinking about those decisions
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:47.160]   as actually taking on two major things,
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.560]   because one is the planning and organization
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:50.380]   around that thing,
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:51.820]   and the other is the actual performance of the thing.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:54.800]   And so I say that because here,
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.720]   what you just described,
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.760]   this 10 steps to consider in designing a program.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.640]   I think some people who are real list makers
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.080]   and love the precision and the thoroughness,
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.120]   and I'm one of these people thinking, this is great,
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.360]   I just want to check off each one of these things
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.800]   on the list and figure out the ideal program for me
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.760]   for a given period of time, et cetera.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:17.200]   And then other folks might be thinking, well, that's a lot,
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.480]   that's just a lot to do.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.880]   But what I know with certainty is that
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:23.920]   performing those sorts of,
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:24.960]   let's just call them what they are,
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:27.080]   those tasks of figuring out what's what,
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:29.200]   where the defenders are, et cetera,
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.360]   without question makes everything go so much more smoothly
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.280]   once you are into the actual performance,
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.520]   the action of doing the exercise program or the book
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.900]   or the podcast or whatever it is that you happen to do.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:45.500]   So I'm grateful that you brought up
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:49.140]   both the things that act as conduits
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.500]   for getting good work done
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:54.780]   and this notion of defenders and bottlenecks,
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:56.600]   because if we don't consider those,
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:59.380]   I would argue that it's a very low probability
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:00.400]   that anyone will succeed.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:03.440]   But when one does consider those, even just a few of them,
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.000]   I think the probability of success
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.160]   goes way, way up immediately.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:08.860]   - That's actually a very good point.
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:10.680]   That is a lot of work for a lot of people.
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.680]   And I know when I'm consuming information,
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:18.600]   it is helpful to hear structure and systems and design.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:21.560]   It's also helpful to hear actual real life examples.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.100]   So maybe the next thing we can do here is
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:29.660]   I can just walk you through an entire setup in a program,
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:32.660]   considering folks that are in bucket A, B and C,
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.440]   and maybe I'll save a little bit of the explanation
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.340]   and we'll eliminate maybe some background
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:41.260]   and I'll just walk you through what this could look like.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:44.480]   All right, so I created a program
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.900]   which should run about a year.
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:50.580]   And the idea here is that this could be an evergreen system.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:54.380]   So one could check off all the boxes
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:55.980]   that we've talked about.
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:59.260]   So in general, we wanna have three primary goals
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:00.140]   with exercise.
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:03.300]   We wanna look a certain way, whatever that means to you.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:05.340]   We wanna be able to perform a certain way,
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:08.100]   whether that's for life goals like hiking and energy
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.380]   or sport goals or whatever.
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:13.340]   And then we wanna be able to do that across our lifespan.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:16.840]   Okay, so a program that gives you all the goals
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.300]   we talked about and a program that covers
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.480]   that health combine that we referred to way back
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.860]   in some of our earlier discussions,
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:27.660]   which as a little bit of a recap is,
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.860]   what are the physical fitness parameters
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:33.100]   that we know are critical to maintaining both lifespan
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:34.700]   and wellness span?
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:35.980]   And as a bit of a reminder,
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:39.160]   those are things like your grip strength,
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:43.020]   your leg strength, your total amount of muscle mass,
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:46.040]   your actual speed and power so that you can catch yourself
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.040]   from a fall, your VO2 max and your physical fitness.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.780]   So I wanna program that as a little bit of all that.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:57.620]   It's similar actually, and we're kind of crossing barriers
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.340]   between our three buckets.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:01.220]   So I need to be able to control my fat.
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:02.740]   I need to be able to have enough muscle.
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:05.420]   That muscle needs to have enough function.
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:09.060]   And I need to be able to maintain range of motion
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:11.540]   so that I don't lose flexibility and get hurt.
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.880]   And then I need to have a good VO2 max,
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.800]   as well as to be able to sustain energy over time.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.220]   So that was the goal of my progress.
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:22.740]   Now, a couple of other things that we haven't chatted about,
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:24.860]   which are very important.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:27.380]   You have mentioned, I think on a previous podcast
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.460]   about the importance of seeing light.
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:31.140]   Is this something you've covered at one point or another?
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:33.980]   - I joke that I'll be going into the grave
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.480]   and there'll be shoveling dirt onto me
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:38.300]   and I'll be telling people what I'll tell you again now,
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:42.220]   which is to get five to 30 minutes of sunlight viewing
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:46.840]   as early in the day as possible, ideally from sunlight.
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:47.900]   That's why it's called sunlight.
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.380]   Or from bright lights of another kind
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:50.860]   if you cannot get sunlight.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:52.300]   And also get that in the evening
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.320]   and then avoid bright lights
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.780]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.640]   unless you do shift work,
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:58.140]   in which case check out our episode on shift work.
[01:51:58.140 --> 01:51:58.980]   - Amazing.
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.780]   So we've got a little bit of a juxtaposition
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.340]   where people are like, I need to work out
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.180]   and do all this training,
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:05.340]   then I'm also supposed to be outside.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:06.980]   Okay, how do I blend those two things
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.720]   in my training program?
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:09.560]   Cool.
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:10.620]   So I checked that box as well.
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:11.840]   I built that in.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.420]   The last thing here is,
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:15.240]   we've talked about structured exercise
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:16.780]   and just in this episode,
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:19.700]   we've really opened up and do non-structured exercise,
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:21.640]   hiking, sports, things like that.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:23.500]   Well, one thing that is incredibly clear
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.180]   and my colleague and friend Tommy Wood
[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:27.360]   at the University of Washington
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:31.560]   published a fantastic paper very recently
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:34.900]   on the importance of proprioception
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:39.480]   in maintaining and staving off late onset dementia
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:40.820]   and Parkinson's.
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:42.900]   - Maybe just remind people what proprioception is.
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:43.920]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:47.080]   So there's structured exercise and that's very important,
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:50.820]   but then there's also things like balance and coordination
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:51.780]   and proprioception,
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.620]   meaning you're adjusting to stimuli
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:55.200]   coming in from the outside world.
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:57.360]   So the stimuli could be sound,
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:59.380]   could be light, could be smell,
[01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:00.900]   or in the physical case of the body,
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:03.180]   it is where you are at in space.
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:05.360]   So I'm feeling like I'm falling to the left,
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.900]   therefore I need to correct and move back to the right.
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:09.880]   So you don't get this with doing things
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.220]   like a hack squat on a machine.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:15.380]   You get this typically from being outside.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:17.140]   So now you're smelling and seeing things
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:18.920]   and you're also not landing with your foot
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:22.000]   in the exact same position on an even platform.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.860]   We get this from things like sport.
[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:26.380]   Now I'm not only exercising,
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:28.240]   but I'm reacting to the outside world.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:30.960]   The ball's going over here, my opponent's going over there.
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.760]   So it's very important in my opinion
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:37.800]   to have at least one session per week of exercise
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.240]   in which you are doing something
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.960]   that challenges proprioception.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:45.000]   So how do I fold all of these best practices
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.360]   into one training program
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.880]   that's not 200 hours a week, seven days a week?
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.160]   That's what I've laid out to you.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.400]   Make sense?
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.240]   Cool.
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:54.060]   Let me walk you through it
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.480]   and then maybe we'll come back
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.560]   into each individual category
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.280]   and you can ask questions about them.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:05.280]   So the way that I think is best is to have a goal
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.960]   and have that goal be around eight to 10 weeks long
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.360]   like we've been talking about.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.360]   So what I gave you is let's start off
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:16.120]   with quarter number one of the year.
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:18.360]   So perhaps January through March or so,
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.380]   and it doesn't have to be this one, but just as an example,
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:23.920]   you decide your goal is gonna be to put some muscle mass on.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:27.600]   So we're gonna prioritize adding muscle, okay?
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.800]   Now within that, you're gonna be bulking up,
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.960]   adding some muscle, but we're also going to be sleeping more.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.480]   We know we need extra recovery in this session
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.240]   and we need to go up in calories.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.480]   Now this happens to work nice for a couple of reasons,
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:43.520]   but in that protocol, maybe we're gonna do seven days
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.240]   or seven sessions a week of physical activity.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.640]   Doesn't mean seven days,
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:50.480]   but maybe those sessions are something like,
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:55.480]   I will do one indoor sport, this could be basketball,
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:57.920]   could be any number of things, right?
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.880]   So I got my sport kicked off and it's indoors, why?
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.480]   I'm January to March.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.960]   The weather's probably not great for most of the world,
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.540]   so I'm not gonna do as much outside activity.
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:10.200]   I'm gonna do weights maybe three or four times a week,
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.220]   and then maybe two days a week, I'll go for a long walk, okay?
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:15.620]   Again, we'll come back and I'll explain to you
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:18.080]   why I made all these individual choices.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:20.040]   So you're gonna run that for the first quarter.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.120]   At the end of this quarter,
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:22.800]   you're gonna take a deload week.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.240]   Now this could be fully off.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.320]   Maybe this is when you schedule a vacation,
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.500]   maybe this is backing off,
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.100]   maybe you just keep your walks in
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:32.240]   and you spend the extra time on your family or work
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:35.120]   or whatever else you need to do.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.700]   So we've bulked up a little bit,
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:39.320]   we spent 12 weeks adding some mass.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:41.460]   Now we're gonna transition into quarter two,
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:43.740]   which is where we start to actually get lean.
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:47.160]   This is actually a pretty standard bodybuilding template,
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.980]   which is you put on some mass first
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:50.880]   and then you get lean after that.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.320]   So now we're gonna get lean from April to June.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:56.160]   We're gonna bring calories down a little bit,
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:57.320]   so now we're actually gonna play
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.040]   in a hypocaloric state somewhat.
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:01.700]   The days tend to get longer,
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:04.940]   so we're gonna have more time to spend in the sun.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.220]   So we're gonna shift a little bit
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:08.080]   from an indoor sport activity,
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.740]   like the example I said earlier was basketball,
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:14.820]   to maybe stand-up paddleboarding or some other thing
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.720]   where you're actually getting your sport done,
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.480]   you're reacting, you're using proprioception,
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:20.420]   but now you're getting that sun in there as well,
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.500]   because you have a greater opportunity to actually do so
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:25.900]   and the weather probably is gonna cooperate with you
[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:29.160]   more often than it would in, say, February.
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:32.060]   You then may be gonna pick a fitness or an exercise class,
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:37.380]   any number of routines where you're with multiple people,
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:41.260]   and then two days a week in addition to that,
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:43.200]   you're gonna maybe lift some weights.
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.240]   All right?
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.940]   So now we've added some muscle,
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.260]   now we've got lean, and all of a sudden
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:52.420]   we're actually looking pretty good for the summertime.
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:54.180]   Hmm, interesting, right?
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:57.660]   Quarter three, July to September, we'll transition,
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:00.740]   and we'll try to get into great cardiovascular shape.
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.900]   So we'll transition more into some high intensity
[01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:04.860]   interval type of stuff more frequently.
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:08.240]   We're gonna maybe stay at maintenance calories now.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.900]   We spent a little bit of time hyper,
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:11.540]   then we went hypo, and now we're gonna go back
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:13.720]   to maintenance and keep along.
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:15.900]   We're gonna continue to choose some outdoor sports,
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:17.160]   but maybe you change it up.
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.160]   Maybe you keep the same one.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.320]   Maybe now we switch it out in the golf,
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:23.540]   or now we pick a pickleball, or we play basketball,
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:25.300]   but now we just do it outside.
[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:27.540]   Any number of things you can do, right?
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.620]   So maybe even we do a couple, change it up.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:31.180]   You do that twice a week.
[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:33.900]   You're spending more time in the sun now,
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.820]   you're looking outside and you're seeing this great weather
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:37.980]   and you're not cooped up in a gym,
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.820]   but you're getting your physical fitness in.
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:42.040]   That's also going to be aiding in your high intensity
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:43.460]   or your interval, your conditioning,
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.000]   'cause you're doing more stuff like that
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.300]   rather than lifting in a gym.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.140]   And then maybe you're actually
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:50.220]   gonna do some track workouts.
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:51.620]   Maybe we'll do this on a bike,
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:55.800]   or we'll do some hill sprints outside, any number of things.
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.900]   And then we'll do that maybe twice a week,
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:02.000]   and then we'll still lift weights twice a week in our gym.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.540]   The last quarter then is gonna be October to December,
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:06.740]   and we're gonna transition there
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:11.340]   and do more pure cardiovascular fitness, okay?
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.420]   Because we're doing that, we're gonna be working harder,
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:15.740]   and remember, cardiovascular training
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:20.740]   is generally expelling much more calories than lifting.
[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:22.720]   So we're gonna actually go up in calories.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:23.560]   We're gonna return to that.
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:25.140]   And that works out kind of well
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.380]   because I don't know if you know or not,
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:29.520]   but people tend to eat a little more calories
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:32.780]   from the months of say November through December.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:35.500]   - Yeah, holidays, at least in Northern Hemisphere,
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.960]   colder temperatures. - Totally.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:40.500]   Maybe even we play with two workouts a day here.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.040]   We're trying to get really in shape,
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.180]   we're trying to improve our conditioning
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:46.300]   and our endurance in multiple areas.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:49.460]   We're gonna actually transition back into an indoor sport.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:51.800]   So maybe we're gonna do some kickboxing
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:55.220]   or a jiu-jitsu class or something like that.
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:57.140]   We're gonna maybe hit the cardio machine once or twice.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:00.180]   Now we're hopping on a StairMaster, a VersaClimber,
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.840]   more maybe getting an assault bike going,
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.220]   something like that.
[01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:06.020]   Maybe hit some machines and do our lifting there.
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:07.920]   Maybe we had spent the rest of the earlier part of the year
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:08.980]   on barbells and dumbbells,
[01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:10.940]   we'll transition to some machines.
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:12.560]   And then we'll still try to get outside
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.600]   and walk twice a week, okay?
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:18.180]   And that gives us our outside activity,
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:21.080]   but it's not necessarily a structured program.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:23.000]   So you can, hey, we got 15 minutes
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.400]   where the weather's breaking a little bit,
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:27.180]   so let's walk, get outside and get a walk in, all right?
[01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:29.860]   So that's the overall structure of everything.
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:32.500]   I would like to actually go back to the beginning now
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:35.300]   and kind of walk through each one of these things in detail
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:37.780]   and explain why I chose certain things.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.620]   I've kind of given some hints already,
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:41.180]   but I think it'd be helpful to walk back
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:42.640]   to the beginning and start there.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:45.080]   - Great, I love the overall structure.
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:46.740]   I have just a couple of questions.
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:51.200]   The idea of training mostly for hypertrophy,
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.980]   January through March, makes sense,
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:57.820]   followed by a period from April through June,
[01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:00.060]   focusing primarily on fat loss.
[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:03.260]   And then from July to September,
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:05.260]   speed and interval type work.
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:08.980]   And then October to December,
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:13.480]   you put to emphasize endurance type training.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:16.300]   I thought for a moment that when we got to October,
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:19.260]   December, you were going to emphasize strength.
[02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:23.340]   And I'm wondering whether or not there's any incentive
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:25.720]   for training for strength October, December,
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:28.220]   so that when one arrives at the hypertrophy training,
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:32.180]   January through March, we're that much stronger.
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:36.320]   The idea being then there's more muscle to hold onto
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.260]   as one then tries to lose fat from April through June,
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:41.740]   and then July through September is the speed work,
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:43.540]   or is July through September
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:46.800]   the speed/power phase of the program?
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:50.260]   - The July through September would be more
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:52.700]   like your higher heart rate,
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:54.200]   learning to get all the way up,
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.540]   maximum exertion, and then recovering.
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:59.540]   - And October to December is long-form endurance?
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:01.140]   - Moderate to long-form, right?
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:04.220]   So it's closer to that aerobic capacity stuff.
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:06.140]   It is closer to longer duration
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:08.140]   and moving through that spectrum.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:09.940]   You are astute in pointing out
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:12.800]   that I didn't have pure strength really in there.
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:14.960]   You certainly could fold it in,
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:19.400]   but quite literally if you spent three months bulking up
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.840]   in January to March,
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:23.180]   that's gonna bring some strength along the way.
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:24.260]   So you should be fine there,
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:28.340]   but you absolutely could alter any of these variables
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.240]   if you wanted to emphasize something more than other ones.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:31.900]   So say you actually felt like you ran
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:34.100]   through the fitness testing and you identified,
[02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:36.280]   actually your endurance is pretty good,
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:39.460]   but you're struggling maybe with a little bit of strength
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:41.780]   and maybe a little bit of lower muscle mass.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:44.760]   You could substitute quarter three or quarter four
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:47.100]   and say one of those quarters will be strength,
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:49.500]   and then I'll do all of my conditioning in another quarter.
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:51.380]   And what you've really done
[02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.420]   is the programming is still fairly simple.
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:55.660]   You've just altered the priorities a little bit,
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:58.340]   and therefore you've altered the adaptation across the year
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:00.100]   and why this is really important.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:01.720]   This template is meant to be something
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:05.180]   you can just run back year after year after year,
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:07.720]   and you make a subtle change like that.
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:11.160]   And now over the course of five, 10, 20 years,
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:14.200]   you're going to be in a fantastic spot at the end.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.320]   So you can make easy adjustments along the way
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:19.780]   as priorities pop up, as goals pop up,
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:21.080]   but you're going to be in a position
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.660]   where there's nothing that's gonna be lagging behind.
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:25.580]   You'll be in a good spot.
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:29.580]   Most of your bases are covered to be pretty lean,
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:32.380]   have a good amount of muscle, and to be in great shape.
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:34.860]   - Two other questions.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:36.640]   One, just a quick question.
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.420]   For sake of generating proprioceptive feedback
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:45.260]   during the endurance phase, is trail running a good option?
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:46.140]   - Absolutely.
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:46.980]   - Great.
[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:48.820]   Thinking back to the days running cross country,
[02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:50.700]   it's October, December, you're trail running.
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:51.540]   - Totally.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:52.360]   - Training for endurance.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.200]   Okay.
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:54.040]   - The ground is not super solid,
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:55.880]   which is even better in this case, right?
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.280]   So you're making more choices
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.320]   and trying to not fall on your face.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:00.160]   - Absolutely.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.720]   And then you mentioned bulking up,
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:04.220]   and I just wanted to highlight
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:08.560]   that there are some folks, myself included,
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:11.040]   while I'd like to add a little bit of muscle here or there,
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:13.380]   I'm not interested in overeating to the point
[02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:15.400]   where I lay down a lot of body fat stores.
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:17.920]   Along with that, I think a lot of people out there
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:20.980]   are not necessarily interested in quote unquote bulking up.
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:24.720]   I also, my understanding of the literature,
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:25.960]   and tell me if I'm wrong,
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:29.540]   is that while there does need to be
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:31.460]   some sort of caloric surplus
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:34.660]   above what is required to maintain body weight
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:37.140]   in order to build muscle,
[02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:39.800]   that many people who try and quote unquote bulk up
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:42.380]   basically just end up expanding the size
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:47.380]   of their cheeks and face along with their limbs and torso.
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:49.500]   I'm not trying to poke fun at them,
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:51.900]   but the idea of deliberately overeating
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:54.700]   to the point where a lot of body fat stores come along,
[02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:56.180]   I would imagine that would just make the April
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:58.060]   through June phase that much harder.
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:03:58.900]   - Correct.
[02:03:58.900 --> 02:04:01.420]   - And I'm not sure it's ever been studied directly,
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:03.880]   but I can't imagine it's all that, excuse me,
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:08.280]   all that healthy to bring along a lot of adipose tissue
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:11.100]   in one's pursuit of hypertrophy.
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:12.780]   - You're absolutely correct.
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:15.840]   We have not gotten into the nutritional details there,
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:16.680]   but yeah, thank you.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.860]   Good clarification point.
[02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:18.840]   A couple of things.
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:21.480]   You're not going to be doing this very long.
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.860]   It's 12 weeks, right?
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:24.300]   We're not going to be six or eight months.
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:25.140]   - You haven't seen me eat.
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:26.180]   (laughing)
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:29.860]   Number two, just since we're here to clarify,
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:32.940]   the literature is ongoing in this area
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:35.020]   and there's actually a handful of studies
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:36.740]   that I know are coming soon.
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:39.220]   But in general, when I say hyper caloric here,
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:42.260]   I'm referring to an increasing caloric intake
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:47.020]   above baseline by something like 10 to 15%.
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:51.020]   So if you normally eat 2,500 calories throughout the day,
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:54.180]   you might add another 250 to 400.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:56.020]   I'm not doubling calories.
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:58.520]   I don't want you to be stuffing your face,
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.680]   hating food, feeling awful all day,
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:03.520]   and then putting on half of your weight as fat
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:05.180]   and half of your weight as muscle.
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:08.200]   It is just technically hyper caloric
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.420]   because you're eating more,
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.460]   which is an absolute requirement for most people
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:14.060]   to add muscle, right?
[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:17.420]   Some folks who have a high percentage of body fat
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:19.840]   and a low level of fitness training
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:22.820]   can actually get away with just being
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:25.420]   either isocaloric technically or even a little bit lower
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:27.900]   and still adding some muscle while losing some fat.
[02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:29.980]   But for most folks, that's going to be challenging.
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:33.340]   So you're gonna wanna be in a hyper caloric state.
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:37.200]   Another reason I put it in here is because remember,
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:40.680]   people tend to make these extra calorie choices
[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:43.340]   during this part of the year anyways.
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:45.860]   And so you're sort of playing into life
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:46.940]   is why I chose that, right?
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:51.060]   It's like, hey, you can't restrict calories all the time.
[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:52.180]   It's really, really hard.
[02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:54.340]   So maybe if we can put it,
[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:56.220]   calorie restriction during the phases of the year,
[02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:59.540]   that's a little bit easier and give you the freedom
[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:00.740]   to have a little bit more calories
[02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:01.620]   during the phase of the year
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.780]   when you're probably gonna wanna do that anyways,
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:06.520]   just make sure you're doing a style of training
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:07.900]   that supports that.
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:09.580]   So you're gonna be trying to add muscle
[02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:11.660]   when you know you're going to be adding more calories.
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:13.780]   We're gonna be trying to really push the pace
[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.860]   on our conditioning when we know we're going
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:17.660]   to be eating more calories anyways.
[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:19.580]   And so that is actually, in fact,
[02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:22.380]   exactly why I chose those goals
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:23.980]   for those times of the year.
[02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:27.520]   It's because we're now playing into life a little bit more.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:30.680]   But we, again, certainly do not wanna be eating
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:34.580]   to an excess where it's causing some of the problems you mentioned.
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:37.420]   We just need to be eating a little bit more.
[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:40.940]   The last point here is the next phase, April to June,
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:43.020]   we know we're going hypocaloric.
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:45.140]   So it's always kinda nice to go, yeah,
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.340]   we're gonna go on a little bit of a calorie deficit here,
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:49.780]   but it's really just these few months.
[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:52.820]   And it's okay because I spent the last six months
[02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:54.420]   where I wasn't restricting that much,
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:57.420]   and then one actually where I got to eat a little bit more.
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:00.960]   And now, cool, not hard for me to convince somebody to go,
[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:03.100]   we're gonna bring the calories down right now,
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:04.500]   or in a month, in two months,
[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:06.500]   and it's just gonna be this 12 or 16 week phase,
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:07.580]   or whatever you end up being in there.
[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:10.120]   So those were some of the rationale
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:11.840]   that I was thinking of when I decided to do that.
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:13.540]   But thank you, that's a very important point
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:17.060]   in terms of the hypocaloric, it's not the dirty bulk.
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:20.200]   It's not the excess that a lot of folks will do.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:23.320]   - And just a final point for folks
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:25.300]   in the Southern Hemisphere,
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:27.140]   Australians and South Americans,
[02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:29.900]   we actually have a large listenership
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:31.180]   in the Southern Hemisphere.
[02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:32.580]   Of course, adjust accordingly,
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:34.820]   even though the holiday months are still
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:36.580]   in November, December,
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:38.580]   they're of course holidays all year long,
[02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:40.980]   but many of the major holidays
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.300]   are around November, December,
[02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:44.180]   but it's summer down there.
[02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:47.980]   Just adjust accordingly, there's nothing wholly
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:50.100]   about trying to achieve certain adaptations
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:51.220]   at certain times of year.
[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:54.180]   It's more about trying to eliminate bottlenecks,
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:56.160]   defenders, as you mentioned,
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:57.900]   and it's really about the sequence.
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:00.620]   - So if we go back to that first quarter,
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:02.780]   we're gonna try to add some mass
[02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:04.780]   for the reasons I just described, right?
[02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:07.540]   It also tends to be pretty motivating.
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:08.660]   You're gonna start the year off,
[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:10.540]   you're gonna wanna train and get all excited
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:12.820]   because of your New Year's resolution,
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:15.020]   and you're gonna see results immediately.
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:16.920]   We've talked about this in some of the previous episodes.
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:18.500]   The nice part about hypertrophy training
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:21.020]   is you see your muscles growing right now,
[02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:23.480]   where the endurance stuff tends to have
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:25.580]   a little bit more of a delayed gratification.
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:28.260]   So I'm gonna give you a win early, okay?
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:30.940]   Now, we're also gonna be sleeping more
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:33.800]   because we know, and maybe we'll get into this
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:34.820]   in a future episode,
[02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:39.220]   that sleep is absolutely critical to recovery
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:40.820]   and critical to growing muscle mass.
[02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:42.760]   So you're gonna emphasize sleep more
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.540]   during this part of the year,
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:46.500]   also because the sun is very low.
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.940]   It's harder to sleep for a lot of folks,
[02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:50.660]   longer when the sun is out for longer,
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:52.860]   especially if you don't have a perfect black-out curve.
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:54.500]   And so you're just trying to play
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:57.040]   with the restrictions life gives you
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.220]   and optimize your scenario.
[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:00.660]   So the sun's probably not out very often,
[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:02.660]   and especially depending on where you live,
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:04.800]   if you're anywhere like where I grew up
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.500]   in the Pacific Northwest,
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:08.780]   it's going to be dark and gray and gloomy most of the day,
[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:10.940]   so it's not hard to convince you to go to sleep
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:12.680]   a little bit more often.
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:14.300]   So we'll do that.
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:16.920]   That's also, again, why I chose an indoor sport.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:21.280]   That activity, you're gonna not shoot yourself in the foot.
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:24.460]   Being in the gym when it's cold and crappy outside
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.500]   is not that hard to convince yourself to do,
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:27.780]   so you're gonna be lifting your weights,
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:29.660]   say, four times a week.
[02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:32.860]   And then, again, getting some outside time
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:34.280]   in the form of a walk,
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.500]   so that you can do it in the middle of work if you have to,
[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:38.660]   or catching 20 minutes here or there,
[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:40.700]   whatever it needs to be.
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:43.900]   The chances of you missing that walk are little,
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:46.300]   and you'll still get some outside time.
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:49.780]   You've talked about the importance of getting sunlight in,
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:51.220]   even if it is overcast,
[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:54.180]   so you can still nail all those boxes
[02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:56.300]   and be in a pretty good spot at the end of that quarter.
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:59.300]   Okay, so moving on to quarter two then, April to June.
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:03.860]   A lot of people wanna look good during the summer months.
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:05.360]   You're more likely to be outside,
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.620]   you're more likely to have your shirt off because it's hot,
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:09.980]   because you're either on vacation or going to the beach.
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:11.880]   So let's play into that a little bit.
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:14.520]   Let's let people look a little bit better,
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:18.720]   if that's what they determined to be looking better,
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:21.100]   during the months when they're more likely to have that.
[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:23.700]   You're also more likely to have things like weddings
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.620]   over the summertime.
[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:27.580]   People don't get married often in the winter.
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.280]   And so people wanna look good for these events,
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:32.320]   so let's play into what a lot of people already want,
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.160]   and let's help you get leaner.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.160]   Not a lot of holidays that involve eating during that phase,
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.000]   and so you're not gonna feel like you're missing out
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.980]   on a ton of life outside of maybe a few smaller holidays
[02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:46.460]   in that phase.
[02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:47.720]   The days are getting longer,
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:50.000]   and so we're gonna choose to get in the sun more often.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.580]   We can start getting a tan better,
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:53.840]   we can start getting ready for summer.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:57.780]   And so this is why we exchanged our indoor sport
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:02.280]   for an outdoor sport, surfing, hiking, cycling outside,
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.420]   whatever the thing is you wanna do.
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:06.060]   There's tons of them, kiteboarding, like I said,
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:07.540]   skateboarding, there you go,
[02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:11.420]   start skating a little bit, whatever it needs to be.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:13.620]   So we'll do that once a week or so,
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:17.020]   and then I actually threw in a fitness class here.
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:19.000]   And there's a couple of reasons.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.260]   One, now it's sort of nice
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:23.340]   to take the pressure programming off.
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:27.920]   It's also nice to, if you've been lifting by yourself,
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.520]   to get in there and lift with somebody else.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:34.160]   It's also nice to now have some social interaction.
[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:38.420]   The gamification, the group, the scoring stuff
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:41.560]   that happens in fitness classes is very, very powerful.
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.820]   It tends to be somewhat fleeting,
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:46.060]   so it won't last for a long time for some people,
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:47.380]   others it does.
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:48.620]   And so if you pepper this thing in
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:51.580]   and you know you're gonna join this activity class,
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:53.100]   even if it's not great
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:56.100]   and the program design isn't perfect,
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:58.220]   it's fine for 10 weeks.
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.220]   In fact, you may really, really enjoy it.
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:04.160]   And also again, it gives you something new to think about.
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:06.600]   Music is on, you're out of your house
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:07.580]   if you're lifting at your house,
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:09.240]   you're in a different part of the gym,
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:10.920]   the schedule's a little tighter.
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:12.640]   So you can't just go work out whenever you want.
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:14.680]   You gotta sort of show up when the class is going
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:16.980]   and you'll probably find that you just love it.
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:20.540]   You also get some social interaction, right?
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:22.180]   Which is something that's also very important
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:23.460]   that we haven't really discussed yet
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:26.320]   if you're out playing basketball by yourself or whatnot.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:29.740]   So this is just another thing I'm trying to fold in
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:32.940]   that still allows you to check off multiple boxes
[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:35.160]   of things that are healthy for you.
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:36.600]   You've had episodes on the importance
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:38.080]   of social connection interaction.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:39.860]   We talked about that in the quad breakdown
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:41.600]   of making sure you have relationship time
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:42.440]   and things like that.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.200]   So throwing in a fitness class
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:46.920]   and just doing honestly something quite different
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:48.480]   is pretty fun.
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:50.380]   But then still keeping two days a week
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:52.900]   where you're doing a traditional strength training thing
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:55.260]   so you have some quality control there.
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:59.320]   Lastly, you can also then make sure
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.560]   you're hitting any specific movements or muscle groups
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.800]   that are very important to you.
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:06.620]   So you don't get to control that in your fitness class,
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:07.860]   but now you can at least do the gym
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:09.640]   and make sure you hit that muscle group
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.540]   that you have an interest in it.
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:13.000]   So now we're feeling pretty good.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.040]   We're rolling into the summer.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:16.800]   We're pretty lean.
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:19.280]   We're getting out in the sun a lot.
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:21.040]   We're bringing calories down a little bit
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.260]   and we probably are feeling pretty happy.
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:24.180]   We're also not burnt out.
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:26.320]   We've done a lot of fun things
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:28.340]   and we've checked a lot of the boxes off
[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:30.240]   for long-term development.
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:34.200]   We had a combination of specificity
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:36.500]   with extra nice selection,
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:38.920]   but we also folded in just a little bit of variation
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:40.640]   so we don't have to worry about overuse injury
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:43.480]   of doing the same machines, the same lift
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:45.240]   months and months and months after months
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:47.360]   and slowly wearing down something
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:48.960]   if our technique isn't perfect.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:51.840]   So now we're gonna go into our quarter three
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:54.240]   which is the summer months basically up here at least,
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:55.320]   July to September.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.800]   We'll transition.
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:00.920]   It's been a while since we've done some conditioning.
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:02.360]   All right, so we may have lost
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:04.320]   a little cardio respiratory fitness.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.840]   We may have not feeling great anymore.
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:08.040]   Maybe energy throughout the day,
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:08.960]   stuff is starting to leak down.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:09.940]   So we're gonna get in shape.
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:11.800]   We're gonna push our heart rate high
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:14.160]   and we're gonna bring the calories back up.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.860]   The summertime, 4th of July,
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:20.360]   other holidays like this where eating is involved.
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:23.400]   Maybe you're going to sporting events and things like that.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:28.800]   Our sport choice is often going to be outdoors.
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:31.480]   But in fact, what you'll notice here
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:34.560]   is I've ramped the sport choice up to twice a week.
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.280]   And in fact, I would encourage you
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.580]   to do two different types of exercise.
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:40.320]   And one of the primary reasons for that
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:42.140]   is to spend more time outside.
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:45.440]   A challenge we often see with people with exercise
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:47.420]   is going, man, it's so nice outside.
[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:50.080]   I can't go sit in the gym for 45 minutes.
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:51.880]   All right, I don't have that much free time.
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:53.340]   And then Huberman's over here telling me
[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:54.740]   I need to get direct sunlight more
[02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:56.440]   and like, how am I gonna fit this in?
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:59.420]   Well, do your exercise outside, enjoy it.
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:01.560]   If you live down here like us,
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.460]   you take sunshine for granted.
[02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:04.640]   But a lot of people I know it's like,
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:07.840]   it's only nice for two and a half months of the year.
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:08.900]   Get outside.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:11.300]   So let's push more of our fitness training
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:13.080]   to outdoor activities.
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:16.220]   These sports can be intense or not, right?
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:18.900]   It could be go out there and swim hard, get in the ocean.
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:20.620]   You're gonna do open ocean swimming
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:22.400]   instead of swimming in the pool indoors
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.760]   or whatever the case may be.
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.360]   So we're gonna give ourselves more of a priority
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:30.240]   of being outside, looking, we've looked pretty good
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:32.600]   or a little tan and we're enjoying all the benefits
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:35.380]   of training outside and the lack of structure.
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:38.220]   Still we have structure, but not so specific
[02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:41.040]   like the machines and the weights give us.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:43.380]   Maybe even now we're doing some track workouts.
[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:46.500]   So now we can do something like sprint the straightaways,
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.740]   lock the corners, and we don't have to again,
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:51.860]   do our conditioning on the same stairmaster or machine
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:53.360]   or whatever we're on.
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:55.260]   So we're gonna enjoy some stuff like that.
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:57.620]   We're gonna be athletic, we're gonna run, we're gonna move.
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:59.160]   We haven't talked about that yet, right?
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.420]   Everything has really been about sort of structured exercise
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:04.180]   well now we're gonna do some sprint work.
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:06.500]   We're gonna get out and see that which is a really important
[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:09.260]   human quality that I think is important to not lose
[02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:10.340]   is actually ability to sprint.
[02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:11.980]   So we'll do that.
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:14.980]   And then we'll still make sure we lift twice a week
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:18.260]   for the same reasons I talked about in the previous phase.
[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:20.660]   So we make sure we have some quality control there.
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:22.700]   We maintain some of the muscle that we built
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:24.060]   in the quarter before.
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:25.880]   We don't lose too much strength.
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:29.840]   There is very good literature to suggest strength maintenance
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:32.960]   can be done in as little as five sets per week
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:36.660]   for a very long time, really up to eight plus weeks
[02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:37.480]   if you do a little bit.
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:38.460]   So you're touching it enough
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:40.060]   to where you're not gonna get really, really weak.
[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:43.940]   But what you wouldn't wanna do is go 12 or 16 weeks
[02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:45.620]   where you'd lifted no weights.
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:46.580]   And maybe you got in great shape
[02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:48.140]   but you're gonna feel very weak after that.
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:50.980]   So maybe that number could come down to one time a week
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:52.780]   if you really wanted it to.
[02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:54.700]   But one to two days a week where you're lifting
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:16:56.640]   the big exercises, the muscle groups
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:59.300]   and the movements of interest, and you're good to go.
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:01.220]   Then lastly, we roll into our final quarter
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:02.780]   which is October to December.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:05.820]   And we're gonna really get in great shape.
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:08.340]   The sun is starting to come down.
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:09.980]   We're rolling into the holidays.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:11.180]   Weather is getting worse.
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:13.660]   We may have other outdoor activities we wanna do
[02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:16.340]   like in my case, you're going on a hunting trip,
[02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:19.780]   you have some travel, conferences, whatever the case may be.
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:22.500]   And so we're going to choose an indoor sport.
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.620]   And I love combat sports.
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:28.020]   So the example I gave earlier was like jiu-jitsu
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:30.980]   or maybe you just transition your basketball to inside
[02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:34.860]   or your pickleball comes inside or whatever it happens to be
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:37.480]   and you're still gonna have that twice a week.
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:40.120]   Then maybe instead of the track workout outside,
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:42.420]   you do that same workout indoors now
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:46.020]   back on some sort of machine or something like that.
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:49.300]   Our weights are actually now down to once a week
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:52.340]   because we're really pushing the pace on cardiovascular.
[02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:54.280]   We're doing it once a week to maintain it,
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:56.580]   to not lose and get too far behind.
[02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:59.000]   But we really wanna bring up our VO2 max.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.300]   We wanna bring up our efficiency,
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:03.900]   our cardiac output and everything like that.
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:06.140]   And we're still gonna now walk twice a week
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:07.860]   so that we get something outside.
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:09.100]   And I talked about why, again,
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:11.820]   it's nice to have that flexibility
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:13.340]   of not having to train outside
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:15.280]   'cause now you gotta warm up and do all those things.
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:17.260]   You just get out and get a walk in.
[02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:18.500]   You still get the outdoor experience.
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:20.580]   So we run through that entire thing
[02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:23.580]   and then you just start back the next year.
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:26.920]   Ideally, again, at the end of every quarter,
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:30.200]   you take a week off, whether that is a true full week off,
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:31.820]   which I'm fully in support of.
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:32.800]   I mean, friends, we're only talking
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.760]   about four off weeks a year.
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.480]   That's absolutely fine.
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:40.040]   Or it could even be a slight deload week
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:41.880]   if you want it to be.
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:44.540]   So we shouldn't run into too many issues of overuse.
[02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:45.900]   We have a lot of variety.
[02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:47.560]   We get a lot of movement patterns in
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:52.080]   'cause we're mixing in sport with machines and dumbbells.
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:53.660]   We're mixing in social interaction.
[02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:54.740]   We're mixing in the sun.
[02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:56.180]   We're mixing in enjoyment.
[02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:59.340]   We're mixing in fat loss, strength, hypertrophy,
[02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:00.700]   some cardiovascular endurance.
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:03.020]   We're mixing in calories in high.
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:05.300]   We're mixing a little bit of calories low.
[02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:08.620]   And we're trying to hit as many of these nodes as possible.
[02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:11.020]   If you also wanted to cut each one of these
[02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:14.500]   a little bit short and repeat your fitness testing
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:16.640]   at the end of every quarter, you could.
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.340]   I would probably recommend doing it at least once a year,
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:24.740]   perhaps doing it maybe the third week of December or so.
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:26.020]   So you run that testing.
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:27.420]   That's your last week of training.
[02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:29.960]   Then you get to go on your vacation break.
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:31.700]   You come back at the beginning of the year.
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:34.800]   You've got new goals, new targets, and you go.
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.400]   If you wanted to repeat it twice a year,
[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:39.740]   do the same sort of thing at the end of June, it's fine.
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:41.940]   I know I laid these out as quarters,
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:45.540]   which is generally 12 weeks with one back off week.
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:47.780]   But if you wanted to make it nine weeks and a testing week
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:50.180]   and then a back off or 10 weeks, it's fine.
[02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:51.060]   It's close enough.
[02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:55.260]   So the last little thing I wanna say is
[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:57.620]   let's assume you're doing the 12 weeks
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:19:59.120]   and you're gonna have a back off week
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:00.920]   at the end of the 12 weeks.
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:02.380]   I would actually still then recommend
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:06.900]   having at least one back off week halfway through.
[02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:07.980]   So it would look like this.
[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:11.020]   Five weeks hard where you're progressing.
[02:20:11.020 --> 02:20:13.640]   You're going up, up, up, up, up.
[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:15.600]   Every week you're either increasing volume intensity
[02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:17.900]   like we talked about a few minutes ago.
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:20.780]   Then week six, deload.
[02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:23.340]   Go down to 70%, volume and intensity.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:26.600]   Come back, go hard for five more weeks.
[02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:29.340]   And now week 12 is your true off week
[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:32.880]   where you, again, take the whole thing off.
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:35.580]   If you do that, you now have four weeks a year
[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:37.620]   where you're totally off.
[02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:41.260]   You have four weeks a year where you're really backing down
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:44.560]   and you just have five week segments all year round
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:47.040]   where you're just gonna push it hard for five weeks.
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:48.500]   You're gonna get a break.
[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:49.320]   You're gonna reset.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:50.700]   You're gonna transition a little bit.
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:53.260]   Now, as I started this conversation off with,
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:55.940]   there are many ways you could structure
[02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:57.540]   your training program throughout the year
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.740]   and hit those primary goals we talked about
[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:03.100]   of looking fantastic, feeling amazing,
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:05.300]   and being able to do that your entire life.
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:09.200]   All I can tell you, though, is I know this model works
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:12.420]   because we've done this a lot with our clients
[02:21:12.420 --> 02:21:14.400]   in our rapid health optimization program.
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:17.200]   And this spans everything from 25-year-old folks
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:20.100]   who are competing in the Boston Marathon
[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:23.240]   to a lot of individuals who have never exercised before,
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.680]   who maybe have done a little bit of exercise.
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:27.460]   In fact, it's quite literally
[02:21:27.460 --> 02:21:29.580]   all three of the buckets you laid out.
[02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:31.860]   We've had clients in all of those areas,
[02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:35.120]   both men and women, young and old.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:37.700]   And we've had a tremendous amount of success
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.260]   transforming their lives using a very similar model
[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:42.840]   to what I just laid out.
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:47.360]   - I find that overall structure to be immensely informative.
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:48.780]   And I'll tell you why in the context
[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:52.220]   of a number of examples of myself,
[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:55.260]   although that's the least important of them, frankly,
[02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:58.540]   but examples of family members of mine and friends of mine
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:02.180]   who've undertaken consistent exercise training programs
[02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:05.400]   but that haven't varied the program so much.
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:08.300]   And here again, I think of the person
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:10.240]   who really loves to swim.
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:13.260]   They have a low barrier of entry to the pool or to the ocean.
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:14.740]   They love being in the water.
[02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:15.800]   I am not one such person.
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:16.940]   I like being in the water,
[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:18.840]   but I don't motivate to drive to the pool
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:21.120]   or to bike to the pool or to get into the ocean that often.
[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:22.820]   Once I do it, I enjoy it.
[02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:25.000]   But for me, it's running and lifting weights,
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.540]   and it has been for a very long time.
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:29.600]   I have a family member, close family member,
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:32.280]   who doesn't really like "exercise"
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:33.960]   but loves dance and dancing.
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:37.860]   Going out dancing, yes, but dance classes in particular.
[02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:39.200]   Really enjoys it.
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:41.240]   Loves to be distracted from the fact
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:43.660]   that she's doing exercise and just really enjoys it.
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:45.380]   And actually is a very good dancer
[02:22:45.380 --> 02:22:48.400]   despite the fact that she's related to me.
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:49.240]   And on and on.
[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:50.960]   There are many examples, I think,
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:53.920]   of folks that fall into the different bins
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:55.320]   that we talked about earlier,
[02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:58.480]   but that also tend to default towards a given structure
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:02.060]   of training one way and doing that throughout the year.
[02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:02.920]   I can tell you right now
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:05.880]   that I'm personally going to modify my schedule
[02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:09.320]   according to this four quarters per year.
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:10.920]   It actually works because I've mostly been
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:13.200]   on the quarter system in academics for a very long time.
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.560]   I was at a university, had a semester system once,
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:17.160]   but this quarter system is actually
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:19.480]   the one that we follow academically.
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:22.480]   So that's one reason why it's a natural fit for me.
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:25.880]   I confess that I typically don't vary up
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:30.880]   the proportions of endurance to resistance training.
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:33.880]   I tend to keep those about three and three across the week,
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:35.360]   three resistance training sessions,
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:37.640]   three, let's call them cardio sessions,
[02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:40.840]   but each one designed to achieve a different adaptation.
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:43.240]   And I've now altered those even further
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:46.480]   based on your recommendations in this episode
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:47.940]   and previous episodes.
[02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:52.940]   But what I have not done is to really think about deload
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:58.440]   and to really stick to the structure that I set out
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:00.220]   to accomplish across the year.
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:03.920]   On the topic of deload, for me, the deload has been
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:07.200]   when I get overwhelmed with work or I've gotten sick,
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:08.460]   I don't tend to get sick that often,
[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:11.460]   but every once in a while I get knocked back with a cold
[02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:14.220]   or a flu, once every three or four years,
[02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:15.400]   I seem to really get hammered
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:17.500]   with a fever inducing something or other,
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:19.340]   and then I'm bedridden for a couple of days
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:21.720]   and then I'm back at it and I tend to come back
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:24.660]   rather slowly and that tends to be my week off.
[02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:28.240]   But I'm beginning to wonder whether or not part of the reason
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.360]   I hit those streaks of being overwhelmed by sickness
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:36.020]   or by stress is that I have not done a deload period.
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:38.760]   So one of the things that I'm going to immediately implement
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:42.240]   is a periodic deload according to the program
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:43.440]   that you described.
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:47.720]   And I'm also going to start matching my specific goals
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:50.200]   for each quarter with time of year.
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:51.960]   I don't think I've done that, and it's not
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:54.040]   because I live in California.
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:56.300]   And by the way, folks, there are temperature variations
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:59.480]   and amount of light across the day variations
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:01.520]   in California as well, although they are not as dramatic
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:04.120]   as they would be near the North Pole, for instance, right?
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:05.880]   But of course, some of the listeners are at the equator,
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:07.420]   so they have the opposite issue.
[02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:11.080]   In any event, I'm definitely going to do that.
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:14.840]   I'm going to start incorporating regular deload periods.
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:18.400]   And I am going to be very dedicated,
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:23.160]   very disciplined about sticking to a program
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:25.160]   for three months devoted mainly to hypertrophy,
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:27.520]   then a three-month program devoted to fat loss,
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:32.000]   then a program to aerobic output,
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.460]   and then one devoted to endurance.
[02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:36.800]   Although I must say it's very tempting for me
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:39.960]   to do a very specific strength-dedicated portion
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:42.040]   because I don't tend to be particularly strong.
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:43.540]   I'm not weak, but I'm not particularly strong.
[02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:45.640]   So I might consult with you
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:49.040]   as to how I could vary endurance and strength.
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:52.620]   In any event, I love the idea of a macro structure.
[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:56.600]   And I love the idea of deloads in anticipation
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:59.720]   of being able to go further in the long run
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:01.520]   in terms of results.
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.000]   I'm hoping this next year,
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.220]   'cause we're just on the cusp of a new year,
[02:26:05.220 --> 02:26:07.740]   will be the first year in which I don't find myself
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:12.080]   getting some bug or virus or whatever it happens to be
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:14.960]   from time to time and having to back off on training
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:16.480]   for that reason.
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:18.540]   And that prompts a question.
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:21.640]   And it's something that I want to get into in more detail
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:26.160]   with you when you describe recovery in an upcoming episode.
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:28.440]   But a couple of quick questions,
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:30.520]   maybe there's some short or shortish answers
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:31.380]   you could provide.
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:34.440]   If I'm not feeling well,
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:36.800]   like I really had a poor night's sleep,
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:41.560]   maybe just two to four hours of sleep for whatever reason,
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:44.600]   train or don't train, that's the first question.
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:46.840]   Second question is if I'm starting to feel
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:48.780]   a little bit of a throat tickle
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:50.480]   and I'm in that phase of denial,
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:52.140]   like I don't get sick, I'm not getting sick,
[02:26:52.140 --> 02:26:56.220]   and would I be better off bundling up some hot liquids,
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:27:00.260]   getting into bed, sleeping a little bit more, et cetera,
[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:02.060]   and protecting myself against that,
[02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:04.160]   or would I be better off training?
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:06.340]   And then the third question is
[02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:09.060]   if I've already succumbed to a bug,
[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:10.540]   but it's not a severe bug,
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:13.960]   I don't have elevated body temperature, so no fever,
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:16.180]   I'm not hacking up a not productive cough
[02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:17.360]   or anything like that,
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:19.500]   but I'm feeling just kind of not well,
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:22.580]   head cold-ish sort of thing comes to mind
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:26.680]   and it's not seasonal allergies, train or don't train,
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:30.020]   leaving aside the point of whether or not
[02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:32.320]   I'm in a position to get anyone else sick,
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.040]   'cause obviously that's a bad idea, okay?
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:38.740]   So lack of sleep, I would say 30 to 40%
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:41.380]   of one's typical sleep the previous night,
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:42.700]   train or no train,
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:45.500]   starting to feel like one might be getting ill,
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:50.180]   and then the third category is coming back from being sick.
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:51.220]   - Okay. - Thanks,
[02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:52.500]   and sorry for the extended question,
[02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.060]   but I want to make sure there was enough detail there
[02:27:54.060 --> 02:27:55.860]   because I think these are three common scenarios.
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:57.900]   - We are going to cover that
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:02.160]   in the recovery conversation that's next in detail,
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:04.460]   and I will give you very specific guidelines
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:06.420]   and we'll have plenty of time to go into that.
[02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:09.680]   The quick answer is it comes back
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.700]   to what phase of training you're in.
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:14.380]   Now, to walk through each scenario,
[02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:16.140]   if it is a crummy night of sleep,
[02:28:16.140 --> 02:28:19.660]   and I am in a phase of training
[02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:22.900]   in which we are trying to cause adaptation,
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:25.380]   I have a lot of space in my schedule,
[02:28:25.380 --> 02:28:30.140]   and I'm really using this time to make progress
[02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:33.460]   because I know coming up soon, my schedule will change
[02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:36.340]   and my time to train will go down.
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:37.940]   I'm still training.
[02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:40.260]   I might use a bunch of tricks that we have
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:42.180]   for feeling better instantaneously.
[02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:45.380]   We call these little hacks, these are acute hacks.
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:47.260]   These are not chronic hacks.
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:49.140]   I'm going to push the pace.
[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:52.240]   If it is really close to a deload week,
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:55.780]   say it's Wednesday and I start my deload next week,
[02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:59.740]   or this is not one bad night of sleep,
[02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:02.220]   this has been four bad nights of sleep
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:03.740]   in the last five days,
[02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:05.700]   this has been six kind of crummy nights
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:08.060]   over the course of the last nine,
[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:10.140]   and you're starting to see a larger pattern,
[02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:11.460]   then that's a different answer.
[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:13.420]   So the question we're going to ask ourself is,
[02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:15.060]   is this acute?
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:20.060]   Or is this a tendency or actually a chronic thing?
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:23.260]   If it's acute and we're close,
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:24.820]   we're going to train through it.
[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:29.460]   If it's acute and this is not a phase of training
[02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:31.020]   where we're trying to really push,
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:33.360]   then maybe we back off a little bit.
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:34.920]   If it's the opposite though,
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:37.740]   we need to probably make some changes
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:39.660]   and give ourselves some recovery.
[02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:44.660]   This may include anything from a moderate training session.
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:48.480]   Maybe I'm going to go in the sauna and sit through that
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:51.480]   and then do some breathing drills and some mobility stuff.
[02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:52.340]   All right, great.
[02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:54.300]   Maybe I'm going to, again, go to the gym
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:58.140]   and ride the bike at 50% heart rate.
[02:29:58.140 --> 02:29:59.420]   Something restorative like that.
[02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:02.200]   Gives you a little bit energy, but doesn't beat you down.
[02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:04.100]   That's probably where we're learning.
[02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:07.540]   If you're feeling sick and you think it's coming,
[02:30:07.540 --> 02:30:09.340]   I'm probably going to do option two as well,
[02:30:09.340 --> 02:30:11.780]   which is some sort of restorative training.
[02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:14.820]   So again, this tends to be moderate, could be weights,
[02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:15.900]   could be any of the stuff.
[02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:17.660]   Maybe you're going to go out for your swim,
[02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:20.900]   but we're not going to push past probably about 70%.
[02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:24.480]   We can absolutely induce immunosuppression
[02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:25.620]   with excessive training.
[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:27.820]   And so you may want to walk out of that.
[02:30:27.820 --> 02:30:32.380]   The last case, which was, I think, phase number three,
[02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:33.440]   you said there, which is sort of like,
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.700]   I got a pretty gnarly cold right now.
[02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:36.700]   Am I going to train?
[02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:37.960]   Most of the time for most people,
[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:40.440]   I'm just going to say, just shut it down.
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:41.640]   Get out of there, right?
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:44.040]   If you're not going to be able to get productivity done
[02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:47.440]   there, you may be better off either going and sleeping,
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:49.460]   catching up on work, doing other stuff,
[02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:51.940]   so that the next time we go to train, you don't feel behind.
[02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:53.420]   And we can give a good solid effort for it.
[02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:56.020]   So I know other people who will train right through it.
[02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:59.400]   I tend to not to be totally frank.
[02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:01.880]   If I'm feeling kind of junky, I'm really not going to train.
[02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:06.800]   I may actually probably do some hot water immersion.
[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:08.900]   So bath, jacuzzi, things like that.
[02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:11.720]   I actually like those better than I like sauna.
[02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:12.820]   - If one is ill?
[02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:14.600]   Or you just like them better than sauna generally?
[02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:15.680]   - Both, actually.
[02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:16.520]   - Oh my.
[02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:20.740]   The first person ever met or come on this podcast
[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:23.240]   to say you like baths and jacuzzi more than sauna.
[02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:24.200]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:26.880]   I may even do some ice.
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:28.120]   Probably not a ton though,
[02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:29.320]   'cause you got to be careful there.
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:30.800]   That's a big stressor.
[02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:33.120]   And if you're already over the line,
[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:34.880]   you may be adding a pass there.
[02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:36.960]   Or I may go sleep.
[02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:40.080]   If I'm feeling very, very, very sleepy,
[02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:42.000]   and sometimes depending on what kind of a bug you get,
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.780]   that can happen, I will just sleep.
[02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:45.840]   And that might be the best choice you have.
[02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:50.840]   If that means you kick the cold half a day earlier,
[02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:53.520]   then you just won in the aggregate.
[02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:57.480]   So those are probably,
[02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:59.240]   it's a little bit of insight of the algorithm
[02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:01.040]   that I'm running with those things.
[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:03.440]   - Those are highly informative answers, thank you.
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:06.900]   And I look forward to our discussion about recovery
[02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:10.960]   so that we can go into even more depth on how to recover.
[02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:12.800]   - The last thing I do want to say here
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:15.840]   is kind of going back to our quarter system.
[02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:21.160]   The examples I gave with the bulking up, losing fat,
[02:32:21.160 --> 02:32:23.160]   and then getting into better fitness
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:25.000]   and cardiovascular fitness at the end,
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.360]   those were just samples.
[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:29.920]   Friends, please don't take that literally.
[02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:32.160]   If you want to emphasize strength more,
[02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:33.160]   put in some more strength.
[02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:34.920]   If you want to emphasize a different one
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:37.640]   of our nine adaptations, great, do that too.
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:42.640]   If you're somebody who has a lot of body fat to lose,
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:45.440]   then maybe put that for two consecutive sessions
[02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:46.600]   or every other.
[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:48.020]   You can modify them.
[02:32:48.020 --> 02:32:51.580]   We've talked about nine very specific training adaptations
[02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:53.600]   as well as in fat loss.
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:55.240]   I only gave you four,
[02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:57.400]   which is just meant to be a sample
[02:32:57.400 --> 02:32:58.840]   that you can roll in or out,
[02:32:58.840 --> 02:33:02.760]   but use those priorities to adjust that system
[02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:05.720]   according to what is important for you now,
[02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:08.800]   five years and then 45 years down the line
[02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:09.880]   for whatever that may be.
[02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:12.760]   So if you are absolutely free to modify the order,
[02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:15.800]   you're absolutely free to modify the primary outcome,
[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:18.960]   and then adjust the specifics within each quarter
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:23.960]   based upon what is needed to do to optimize that outcome.
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:28.440]   I think maybe one more tool we can offer people
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:31.680]   is maybe giving the individual week
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.920]   a little bit more structure.
[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:35.840]   So the system I laid out is sort of like month by month,
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:38.440]   and maybe we can lay out, say,
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:40.500]   a three-day-a-week workout program
[02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:42.520]   and a four-day-a-week program
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:44.360]   that would still hit some of the same
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:48.000]   well-rounded adaptations that probably covers
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.540]   maybe not individualized per bucket
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:52.120]   that we've talked about, A, B, and C,
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:56.480]   but it's gonna cover 75, 80% of what would need
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:57.640]   to occur in all three buckets,
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:00.480]   and then you can use that last 25%
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:02.660]   for your individual goal or specialization.
[02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:04.960]   So maybe we can jump into that next.
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:06.220]   - Great, let's hear it.
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:07.360]   - The first one I wanna give you
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:11.880]   is just a basic three-day split that, again, same idea.
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:13.860]   It's a well-rounded exercise program.
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:17.300]   I actually wrote this all in an article
[02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:19.320]   that is on XPT's website,
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:20.880]   so perhaps we can link directly to that.
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:22.520]   I will just jump you straight to the answer.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:24.600]   You can read more about why in details
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:25.860]   in that article if you'd like.
[02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:29.380]   But this is day one, day two, day three.
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:32.680]   You could do these days where you split them up,
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:34.580]   actually having, say, 24 hours in between,
[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:36.200]   or you could do these back-to-back.
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.700]   It doesn't necessarily matter.
[02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:40.320]   In this particular case, say day one,
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.000]   you would start off and do a little bit of speed and power,
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.060]   and then you may finish that
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:46.700]   with a little bit of hypertrophy.
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:49.420]   Now, if you wanna gain more speed and power,
[02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:51.060]   you just do more of it.
[02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:53.240]   If you wanna maybe just do a little bit to touch it,
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:54.700]   and you really wanna gain some muscle,
[02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:56.560]   you would do more of an emphasis there.
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:58.820]   So the template can stay the same,
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:00.720]   and you would just increase the amount
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:03.320]   of either adaptation, the speed and power stuff,
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:04.160]   or the hypertrophy,
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:07.600]   based on how high it is in your priority list.
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:08.860]   Those are combined together,
[02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:10.240]   because as we talked about earlier,
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:12.400]   they don't necessarily interfere with each other.
[02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:15.400]   You would do the speed and power stuff first,
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:17.040]   because it wouldn't hamper the hypertrophy.
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:19.240]   If you did the hypertrophy first in that workout,
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:22.140]   it would probably compromise your speed and power,
[02:35:22.140 --> 02:35:23.160]   and in that case,
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:25.080]   you would actually not be getting your adaptation.
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:27.560]   So day one, you do that.
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:29.660]   And that could be a 20 minute workout total,
[02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:32.740]   or a two and a half hour up to you.
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:34.500]   Then you would come back maybe the next day,
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:36.560]   or two days later, whatever you'd like to do.
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:38.340]   In your second day of exercise,
[02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:42.640]   you would start off with a pure strength protocol,
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:44.120]   and you would finish that with,
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:46.080]   what I'm calling just a higher heart rate.
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:49.240]   So this could be something like our anaerobic capacity stuff.
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:51.640]   It could be the aerobic capacity,
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:52.900]   something where you're getting up
[02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:54.380]   to close to high heart rate.
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:55.960]   It could be those 20 second bursts.
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:58.520]   It could be a 90 second burst, five minute mile repeats.
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:35:59.480]   Anything you like.
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:01.280]   You could just sort of plug and play this in.
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:02.600]   You're getting to a spot now
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:04.740]   where you've had a little bit of speed,
[02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:06.880]   a little bit of strength, a little bit of hypertrophy,
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:08.260]   and you've touched a high heart rate.
[02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:10.680]   So we've checked off most of the boxes already
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:11.520]   in two sessions.
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:15.340]   Our last session then would be more of a steady state,
[02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.840]   long duration endurance.
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:19.580]   And so a three day a week split like that
[02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:22.760]   is gonna be a pretty nice setup for the average person.
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:25.040]   - So this could be a Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:26.680]   Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:28.920]   What's happening on the intervening days?
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:30.840]   - Totally off if you want it to be.
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:33.240]   So I set this up as in the best I can give you
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:34.740]   in at least three days.
[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:35.580]   Okay, great.
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:37.760]   If you have more, we could certainly improve it.
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:39.520]   But this was my worst case scenario.
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:41.680]   I've got other things in my life.
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:44.140]   The most I can do for exercise is three days a week.
[02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:46.080]   - And given that it's three days per week,
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.580]   how approximately how long are each of these workouts
[02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:50.420]   going to last?
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:53.340]   - I would do whole body exercises for almost all that.
[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:54.880]   I would do your full body parts.
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:56.440]   And I think you could certainly finish that
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.400]   in 45 minutes of work time.
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:00.240]   Little bit of time to warm up,
[02:37:00.240 --> 02:37:01.840]   some down regulation at the end.
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:03.480]   You could be in and out of that gym
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:05.200]   in certainly under 60 minutes.
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:06.880]   The reality is you could probably be out of there
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:08.660]   in under 50 minutes.
[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:11.900]   The total work time could be 30, 35 once you get going.
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:14.360]   - So that's three days.
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:17.880]   As you pointed out, probably more work per week
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:21.780]   is going to be better in terms of maximizing goals
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:25.320]   of aesthetic goals and performance enhancing goals
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:27.400]   and longevity goals, right?
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:29.460]   I mean, the numbers that I've heard
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:31.780]   that is that we should all try to get somewhere
[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:35.080]   between 150 and probably more like 180 to 200 minutes
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:37.980]   of zone two cardio per week minimum.
[02:37:37.980 --> 02:37:41.240]   But as I recall, you consider zone two cardio
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.320]   so low intensity that just walking around
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.980]   and is, you know, qualifies as zone one, zone two cardio.
[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:52.000]   - Yeah, not to take us too far off track,
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.280]   but I think it's actually useful to differentiate
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:58.820]   what I consider to be exercise and physical activity.
[02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:04.080]   So physical activity is out for a walk.
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:08.240]   It is using a walking treadmill while you're at work.
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:11.800]   It is, you know, parking farther in the parking lot
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:12.900]   and taking more steps.
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:14.640]   These are all important.
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:18.520]   And what's clear, you are not going to reach
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:22.640]   likely optimal health by only exercising hard
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:26.000]   and then sitting around the other 23 and a half hours today.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.120]   So it's very, very important.
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.720]   Whether you want to do that in the form of zone one
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:33.520]   or zone two and hit 30 minutes a day,
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:35.600]   various organizations will say things like that.
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:37.780]   You need to have 30 minutes a day
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:40.200]   of moderate to low intensity exercise.
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:41.040]   I don't really care.
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:43.560]   You can combine it like that if you want.
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:48.320]   What you don't want to do is just physical activity only,
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:50.920]   which is almost always going to be like zone one
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:53.160]   to maybe zone two.
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:55.460]   You also don't want to go the other end of the spectrum,
[02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:58.000]   which is again, like I lift hard three days a week
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.260]   and then what do you do the rest of the time?
[02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:00.440]   Nothing.
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:01.940]   That's not optimal either.
[02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:05.420]   And so I guess the system I've walked you through here
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:08.360]   or the example rather I walked you through is
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:10.340]   you would need to maybe supplant that
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:11.480]   with being physically active.
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:15.480]   If you work, say you're a nurse and you're on your feet,
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:16.360]   you're moving up and down,
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:18.680]   you're probably actually covering a decent amount
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:19.520]   of your physical activity
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.720]   'cause you might be at 15,000 steps a day.
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:24.900]   If you're sitting in front of your computer
[02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:26.400]   and you do this same three day split,
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:28.120]   you would probably need to go out of your way
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:30.520]   to make sure you're adding a bunch more steps.
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:33.320]   And so you might need to add several hours of walking
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:37.780]   to hit that 150, 180 minutes a week of physical activity
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:40.320]   because the program I laid out is,
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:42.480]   if you're doing really 45 minutes, three days a week,
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:45.640]   maybe 60 minutes, at best you've hit 180,
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.160]   in terms of 60 minutes times 380 a week.
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:49.680]   So you might actually need to then throw in
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.040]   maybe some more specific walks.
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:54.240]   So you could do that a number of ways.
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:57.040]   It could be, again, actual structured exercise.
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:39:58.760]   It could be simply I'm gonna do a 10 minute walk
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:39:59.780]   three times a day.
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:02.680]   It could be the exercise snacks that we talked about
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:03.820]   in a previous episode.
[02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:07.960]   So there's lots of ways to engage in more physical activity.
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:10.540]   But to me, those are different oftentimes
[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:12.940]   in structured exercise.
[02:40:12.940 --> 02:40:14.560]   - I think many people will appreciate
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:18.960]   that you put out there for us a three day a week protocol
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:22.800]   because many people simply don't have more time to exercise.
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:25.320]   They're putting emphasis on these other bins
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:26.160]   in the quadrant.
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:29.860]   And frankly, those other bins are very important as well.
[02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:34.720]   So wonderful that people can check off some critical boxes
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:37.680]   for aesthetics and performance and longevity
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.560]   with three days of work or workouts per week, I should say.
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:45.200]   What are some other schedules that people can follow
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:47.500]   if they're willing to dedicate a bit more time
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:48.440]   toward their fitness?
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:49.280]   - Sure.
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:52.760]   If you wanted to do another sample of maybe a four day week.
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:55.680]   And again, to clarify this, I'm really happy you said that.
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:58.320]   This is a four day week of structured exercise.
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:01.840]   This would not account your physical activity moving around.
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:03.100]   - Which everybody should be doing.
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:04.400]   - Absolutely.
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:07.240]   Maybe this is something like day one,
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:08.960]   you're gonna do a strength training session
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:13.800]   and you'll stay in the five to 10 or so repetition range.
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:16.800]   A little bit of strength, a little bit of hypertrophy.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:21.080]   You've checked off a couple of boxes, probably whole body.
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:24.640]   So that you get all the body parts covered or close.
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:27.280]   We're looking at generally multi-joint exercises.
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:32.000]   Could be a combination of barbells, free weights, bands,
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.800]   machines, anything like that would be sort of day one.
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:37.900]   You could come back the very next day
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:39.840]   or you could wait 24 hours.
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:42.040]   But the second day of your exercise
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:43.880]   would be maybe your long duration.
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:46.120]   And this is actually sort of similar to how you set it up.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:47.600]   It's you do a little bit of the inverse,
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:49.800]   but what you're kind of saying is I'm probably gonna be
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:52.160]   a little bit sore from day one.
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:55.120]   And I don't have any free body parts that aren't sore.
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:57.480]   So instead of trying to do another lift or something,
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:00.880]   I'm just gonna put in some restorative longer duration stuff.
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:02.760]   Same exact principles for long duration
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:04.000]   we just talked about.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.980]   Could be a swim, could be any number of things,
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:09.500]   could be your sport.
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:11.180]   Could be your out, you know, ride the bike
[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:15.880]   and go for a jog in the sun, whatever you would like to do.
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:17.540]   If you're feeling better,
[02:42:17.540 --> 02:42:19.140]   maybe that's a little harder or longer.
[02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:21.100]   If you're feeling pretty beat up from the day before,
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:23.340]   maybe that's a little bit shorter and slower.
[02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:24.780]   You can modify it.
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:28.980]   Then maybe you take the next day off or that's open.
[02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:32.220]   Your third day of exercise is now instead of being
[02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:35.380]   that five to 10 repetition range for your lifts,
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:39.940]   you do something like 11 to 30 reps range.
[02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:41.980]   Also, this could be exchanged
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:44.820]   for something more like body weight,
[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:46.440]   more muscular endurance type of stuff.
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:48.800]   So this is a great day, maybe it's yoga.
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:51.900]   Maybe it is a gymnastics thing you're working on
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:54.040]   or any of the many other styles of training
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:56.940]   that are not in quote unquote lifting weights,
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:42:58.720]   but they're not just walking and hiking.
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.620]   So it could be a Pilates or equivalent.
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:02.760]   Anything like this where you're gonna get
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:03.700]   some muscular burn in there,
[02:43:03.700 --> 02:43:06.340]   but it's probably not any additional weight
[02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:07.420]   outside of body weight.
[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:09.180]   Or if it is, it's fairly minimal,
[02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:11.180]   five, 10, sort of 15 pounds.
[02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:13.140]   Something like that would be nice.
[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:15.820]   Could also be done in a circuit.
[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:18.220]   So we could hit our high heart rate
[02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:21.660]   and we could hit some muscular endurance in there.
[02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:24.780]   Group activity class might be nice here.
[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:28.500]   Even maybe something like a spin class or a dance class.
[02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:29.580]   All these things could be great.
[02:43:29.580 --> 02:43:31.780]   And then maybe you even finish that
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:35.020]   with 10 minutes of some light weights
[02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:36.640]   to hit the body part you say didn't get.
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:39.080]   So maybe you did the dance class and then you finish
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:41.420]   and you do 10 minutes of upper body,
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:44.820]   sets of 30 to make sure you get a nice pump there
[02:43:44.820 --> 02:43:46.540]   because your legs probably got some work
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:48.180]   during the dance class, but your upper body didn't.
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:50.100]   So you balance the system out a little bit.
[02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:53.460]   So all body parts got a little bit of muscular endurance.
[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:56.380]   Your heart rate got really high, came back down
[02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:59.660]   and you sort of checked both of those boxes.
[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:04.660]   Now it's important to remember the hypertrophy episode.
[02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:11.220]   Doing sets of say 15 plus repetitions per set
[02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:15.660]   is as effective as doing sets of five to 10 or 12
[02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:17.800]   for hypertrophy, gaining muscle.
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:20.220]   It's not effective though for strength gains.
[02:44:20.220 --> 02:44:22.020]   So you wouldn't want to do this only
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:23.860]   because you'd really be doing nothing
[02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:25.420]   to improve your muscle strength.
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:27.860]   And you want to make sure that that box is ticked
[02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:29.340]   at least a little bit.
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:33.100]   Then again, you could take the day off after this
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:36.080]   or you could roll right into your fourth exercise day,
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:38.560]   which would be your last exercise session of the week.
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:43.060]   And you would do something more of like a medium intensity.
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:44.920]   So this is a little bit higher intensity
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:46.700]   than our second day.
[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:50.340]   And this could be something like shadowboxing
[02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:51.360]   or hitting a heavy bag.
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:54.620]   It could be a little bit of higher intensity intervals
[02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:56.500]   but not all the way up.
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:00.620]   So maybe this is, you're gonna do a one minute on,
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:03.540]   one minute off on the bike,
[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:06.140]   but you're only gonna go to like 85, 90% heart rate.
[02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:08.940]   And then instead of going off during that one minute,
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:10.980]   you drop it down to 50%.
[02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:13.820]   So it would actually look like 30 minutes of straight work,
[02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:16.640]   but you would have a little bit of rolling intensity
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:19.860]   as opposed to staying really nice and restorative.
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:21.920]   It's gonna be some work there.
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:24.840]   And you would finish it with something like
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:28.460]   five to six minutes total of max heart rate stuff,
[02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:30.100]   which lines up perfectly with that number
[02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:34.160]   you actually created in our endurance episode
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:36.180]   of hitting six minutes total per week
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:39.760]   of maximum heart rate or close.
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:42.720]   So you could wrap that all up kind of into one session.
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:44.780]   You could do those in the inverse order,
[02:45:44.780 --> 02:45:47.640]   thorough warmup, a few minutes,
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:50.260]   whether you wanna do 30 second bursts or a minute bursts
[02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:51.400]   or straight five minutes.
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:55.380]   This is a protocol I like to use a ton on the assault bike.
[02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:59.500]   It is simply a good warmup, 10 minutes solid warmup.
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:01.820]   Recover, and then I'm gonna go five minutes
[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:04.220]   and cover as much distance as I can in five minutes.
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:05.060]   - Brutal.
[02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:06.520]   - It is brutal and it's amazing.
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.300]   And you get a lot done in five minutes.
[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:13.580]   10 minutes on the back of that is a very gradual
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:15.320]   bring back to earth there.
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:16.420]   I actually, in that case,
[02:46:16.420 --> 02:46:18.220]   I don't need to do down regulation breathing
[02:46:18.220 --> 02:46:19.900]   'cause I've spent 10 minutes
[02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:22.040]   actually coming way back down.
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:24.680]   And the last two minutes or so of that
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:28.060]   is very deliberate five second inhale through the nose,
[02:46:28.060 --> 02:46:29.520]   five second exhale through the nose
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:31.580]   while I'm barely just moving.
[02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:32.960]   And you end up being in a pretty good spot.
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:37.340]   So that again, time-wise could easily be done in 30 minutes
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:39.020]   and you'd be rounded off there.
[02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:42.360]   So the nice part about this four day a week split
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:44.380]   as well as a three day a week split
[02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:46.960]   is it does give you a little bit of flexibility.
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:50.340]   And so what I mean is maybe Monday your plan
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:53.340]   is to do the day one lift.
[02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:55.900]   And then any number of things popped up in life.
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:58.120]   You shipped it back to Tuesday.
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:46:59.900]   Rather than saying like Monday is leg day
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:00.880]   and then all of a sudden something happened,
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:01.720]   you miss leg day.
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:03.780]   It's just you're doing these things in order
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:07.880]   and you would like to get all four done in a seven day span.
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:10.180]   But if it doesn't happen, fine.
[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:11.860]   The next day you get the workout,
[02:47:11.860 --> 02:47:13.860]   you just go right back into the next workout
[02:47:13.860 --> 02:47:17.560]   and it doesn't matter what day they land on exactly.
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:20.640]   For the three day routine that works very nice
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:22.880]   because the assumption there
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:26.480]   is you really only have time for three workouts a week.
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:27.880]   And so that's sort of implicit
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:29.480]   is there's probably some chaos happening
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:31.280]   in the schedule a little bit
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:32.840]   and you don't really have the ability
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:34.600]   to lock in three days per week.
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:36.720]   If that's not the case, you can go.
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:40.400]   But we're trying to listen to the pain points
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:42.480]   that people have with exercise
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:45.160]   and see if we can give them some solutions for those.
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:50.400]   - Several things about this program are attractive to me.
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:52.000]   One of them you just mentioned,
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.940]   which is that by not rigidly attaching individual workouts,
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:47:58.880]   just two specific days of the week,
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:02.260]   one in theory could say, okay,
[02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:03.620]   I didn't get that much sleep last night.
[02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:06.880]   I don't feel, I know that a lot of people say what is feel,
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:07.960]   but I don't feel recovered
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:10.980]   or like I'm gonna get that much out of the workout tomorrow.
[02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:12.560]   So I'm, or today,
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:14.940]   so I'm just gonna push it forward a day.
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:18.420]   And the ability to slide workouts forward or back by a day
[02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:22.740]   I think is incredibly valuable for the consistency sake.
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:24.520]   I also really like this idea
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:26.440]   of some of the long duration work coming a day
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:30.040]   after hitting the strength and bit of hypertrophy work.
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:32.280]   So this would be the day two.
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:35.140]   One thing that I've experienced over and over
[02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:38.280]   is that if I'm very sore in a given muscle group,
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:41.940]   especially my legs, doing some low intensity cardio,
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:44.220]   whether or not it's a jog or on the bike,
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:48.060]   typically for me, it's a jog or even skipping rope
[02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:50.000]   and then walking, skipping rope and walking
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.040]   does seem to dissipate the soreness.
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:53.700]   I'm sure there's a mechanism for that.
[02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:55.500]   There's a mechanism for everything, frankly,
[02:48:55.500 --> 02:48:58.720]   but I like that arrangement.
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:02.960]   And then I also like this idea of making sure
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:07.000]   that there's a workout for muscular endurance,
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:08.780]   because I feel like unless I've been stuck
[02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:10.260]   without a good gym,
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:14.160]   or I've decided to specifically train body weight exercise,
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:15.220]   which I did a few years ago,
[02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:18.940]   I got really excited about some of Pavel Satsoulin's work.
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:21.160]   - Great stuff, yeah, amazing. - He has a book,
[02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:24.200]   "The Naked Warrior," which doesn't involve training naked,
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:25.460]   although I suppose you could if you wanted,
[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:26.980]   but it was really about no weights
[02:49:26.980 --> 02:49:29.580]   and involved building up to pistol squats
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:32.260]   and one arm pushups and things of that sort,
[02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:33.860]   even doing pull-ups on doors.
[02:49:33.860 --> 02:49:35.400]   And I discovered that some door frames
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:37.720]   are much stronger than others in hotels.
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:41.380]   I just accidentally caused some damage there.
[02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:44.440]   But in any case, muscular endurance, I think,
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:46.260]   is a really interesting one
[02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:48.700]   that I plan to incorporate into my schedule.
[02:49:48.700 --> 02:49:52.900]   But that is, I think, is one that's often overlooked,
[02:49:52.900 --> 02:49:54.460]   unless people really have an aversion
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.820]   to weights and to machines.
[02:49:56.820 --> 02:49:57.780]   - You're right, and it shouldn't be,
[02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:00.740]   because it's pretty low-hanging fruit.
[02:50:00.740 --> 02:50:03.300]   You don't need a lot of equipment for it, typically.
[02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:04.540]   It doesn't hurt that bad.
[02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:06.500]   You don't often get that sore out of it,
[02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:09.360]   and you're going to feel a nice, wonderful pump afterwards.
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:12.500]   So it's a great mode, and as we discussed many times now,
[02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:14.880]   it is quite effective at hypertrophy.
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:17.400]   - Yeah, I also, I don't know if they fit specifically
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:21.040]   with muscular endurance, but if you look at the physiques,
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:23.020]   for example, on rock climbers,
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:24.880]   I mean, they have, to me, of course,
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:28.720]   they have, usually the experienced climbers
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:33.440]   have pretty remarkable body compositions.
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:35.260]   They tend to be lean and live and flexible,
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:37.860]   all those things that many people aspire to.
[02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:39.200]   The other thing is their development
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.500]   always looks exceedingly balanced.
[02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:43.380]   You don't really tend to see climbers
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:44.920]   that are overdeveloped in the torso
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:46.060]   and underdeveloped in the arms,
[02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:48.500]   or overdeveloped in the arms, despite all the climbing
[02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:51.720]   and underdeveloped relatively in the other limb movement.
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:53.740]   That's true for women and men.
[02:50:53.740 --> 02:50:56.700]   It's not a sport that I participate in,
[02:50:56.700 --> 02:51:00.020]   but it seems like what they're doing
[02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:01.300]   is essentially muscular endurance training.
[02:51:01.300 --> 02:51:02.260]   - Basically, yep.
[02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:05.080]   - Yeah, so there's really something there to be valued.
[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:07.880]   So that's a four day a week schedule
[02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:12.440]   with off days or rest days inserted as needed,
[02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:14.680]   and then just continuing.
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:17.600]   For those that are a bit more committed to their fitness
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:21.400]   and want to do a five or six day a week program,
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:24.760]   would you recommend just collapsing some of the off days,
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:26.080]   paying more attention to recovery,
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:28.880]   and cycling through more quickly?
[02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:29.720]   - Absolutely.
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:32.000]   You could combine that and just run that,
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.180]   either one of those programs.
[02:51:33.180 --> 02:51:36.660]   So you could run that three day a week program back to back.
[02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:38.020]   Do that, get that done in six days.
[02:51:38.020 --> 02:51:40.220]   - Ah, so day one, speed, power, hypertrophy,
[02:51:40.220 --> 02:51:43.260]   day two, strength, work with elevated heart rate,
[02:51:43.260 --> 02:51:45.100]   anaerobic capacity, and day three, endurance,
[02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:46.660]   and then just cycle through again.
[02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:49.980]   - Yep, you take day four off of the week,
[02:51:49.980 --> 02:51:51.340]   and then you go back again.
[02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:55.580]   So you'd be having six days of exercise, one day off,
[02:51:55.580 --> 02:51:58.040]   and you'd be getting every one of those adaptations in
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:51:59.140]   multiple times a week.
[02:51:59.140 --> 02:52:00.700]   That is almost exactly how I would set up
[02:52:00.700 --> 02:52:01.880]   a six day a week program.
[02:52:01.880 --> 02:52:04.740]   - Great, I love the elegance and the simplicity of that,
[02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:07.500]   and the thoroughness of it, because it checks off so many,
[02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:10.660]   if not all, of the nine major adaptations to exercise
[02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:13.260]   that we've been talking about these episodes.
[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:16.660]   And I suppose the one thing that I want to highlight
[02:52:16.660 --> 02:52:19.140]   and pose this also as a question is that
[02:52:19.140 --> 02:52:23.300]   early in our discussions, in a previous episode,
[02:52:23.300 --> 02:52:26.540]   you mentioned that so much of what people think of
[02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:30.060]   and apply as it relates to resistance training
[02:52:30.060 --> 02:52:33.040]   is borrowed from bodybuilding and hypertrophy training
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:35.880]   specifically, which typically involves getting close
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:38.620]   to failure or failure, sometimes even involving rest pause,
[02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:40.300]   where you hit failure, then set the weight down
[02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:42.760]   for a few seconds and repeat these high intensity techniques
[02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:46.680]   accentuating the negative, so-called eccentric, et cetera.
[02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:50.680]   In hearing about these protocols of three day a week
[02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:54.340]   or four day a week, six day a week, it's very clear to me
[02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:59.340]   that if one is not careful to omit that kind of thinking,
[02:52:59.620 --> 02:53:02.540]   and suddenly is taking their strength work and speed work
[02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:05.780]   to failure, or is pushing too hard on muscular endurance
[02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:07.220]   to the point where you're just grinding out
[02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:09.220]   that very last push up on every set,
[02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:12.360]   that the amount of soreness and the amount of recovery
[02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:15.500]   that results from these workouts
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:18.140]   might start to cause progress issues.
[02:53:18.140 --> 02:53:19.900]   So one thing that's in the back of my mind is,
[02:53:19.900 --> 02:53:21.660]   as you've described these programs is that
[02:53:21.660 --> 02:53:23.100]   even though some of them are very brief
[02:53:23.100 --> 02:53:25.260]   or involve a minimum of time commitment,
[02:53:25.260 --> 02:53:27.380]   in particular the three day a week,
[02:53:27.380 --> 02:53:29.220]   but also the four day a week schedule,
[02:53:29.220 --> 02:53:32.580]   that there is a discipline involved
[02:53:32.580 --> 02:53:34.860]   in making sure that you stick to the workout
[02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:36.460]   that you're supposed to do that day
[02:53:36.460 --> 02:53:39.500]   and not go ham, as they say,
[02:53:39.500 --> 02:53:42.260]   and just throw in a couple extra sets of bicep curls
[02:53:42.260 --> 02:53:43.980]   and tricep pushes 'cause you wanna do that
[02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:45.700]   and you thought maybe you could get away with that,
[02:53:45.700 --> 02:53:47.620]   but you have to come back pretty quickly
[02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:50.580]   and do some serious, meaning devoted,
[02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:53.380]   speed and power work or strength work.
[02:53:53.380 --> 02:53:55.740]   And if you haven't been disciplined
[02:53:55.740 --> 02:53:58.500]   about not doing certain forms of exercise,
[02:53:58.500 --> 02:54:01.540]   I could see how the whole thing could kind of crash quickly
[02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:03.380]   and one could think, oh, this is just too much work
[02:54:03.380 --> 02:54:05.380]   or it's not for me.
[02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:08.820]   So this, I suppose, is now where the question comes,
[02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:11.980]   which is what are some of the key points
[02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:13.140]   that people need to keep in mind
[02:54:13.140 --> 02:54:15.820]   when they embrace a program?
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:19.300]   How rigidly do they need to stay attached to,
[02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:21.940]   today's endurance day, I'm just doing endurance.
[02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:24.180]   Today's strength day, I'm just doing strength work.
[02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:26.340]   I'm not gonna take things to absolute failure
[02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:27.740]   or beyond failure.
[02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:32.740]   I am absolutely happy with anyone modifying
[02:54:32.740 --> 02:54:37.940]   any of the sample programs however they would like to.
[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:42.380]   My only recommendation for the question you just posed
[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:44.940]   would be set your program
[02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:48.380]   and then if you're going to make a change, fine,
[02:54:48.380 --> 02:54:50.900]   but that is a change to your program.
[02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:54.980]   In other words, don't just make decisions every single day
[02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:55.820]   and make changes.
[02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:58.460]   If you're doing that, you might as well not have a program
[02:54:58.460 --> 02:55:01.060]   and as we described earlier, there is clear evidence
[02:55:01.060 --> 02:55:03.620]   that having a program is better than not,
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:06.380]   regardless of the effectiveness of the program
[02:55:06.380 --> 02:55:09.580]   and so my general comment to that is, okay, fine,
[02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:13.380]   a day or two, you made some modifications, no problem.
[02:55:13.380 --> 02:55:14.820]   We're in a situation now where it's like
[02:55:14.820 --> 02:55:18.060]   you're basically changing the workout every day as you go,
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:20.260]   then we just need to write a new program.
[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:21.820]   We need to reassess where we're at
[02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:23.780]   because we need to have some structure.
[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:27.480]   Look, the reality of it is I change the programming
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:29.920]   I'm going to do the day of often
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:31.380]   because of any number of situations.
[02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:33.220]   I just don't feel like it.
[02:55:33.220 --> 02:55:35.500]   I way overestimated today.
[02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:37.160]   We talked a little bit in a previous episode
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:40.900]   about auto regulation, which is a style of periodization
[02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:42.740]   and program design, which you're adjusting
[02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:45.180]   based on how you're actually feeling that day
[02:55:45.180 --> 02:55:46.980]   but with some specific structures.
[02:55:46.980 --> 02:55:48.820]   So you're gonna take some measurements that day and adjust.
[02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:51.960]   So auto regulation is a very, very effective tool.
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:54.380]   You just need to make sure that that auto is dialed.
[02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:56.660]   In other words, is it because your body
[02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:58.080]   actually needed something different
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:01.300]   or is it because you're now just getting a little bit lazy?
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:03.420]   Now you're just not feeling like it today.
[02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:06.740]   So there's a little bit of an impossible line to draw there.
[02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:09.540]   Both scenarios are real, gray area.
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:11.220]   A lot is real in the moment
[02:56:11.220 --> 02:56:13.460]   and so you just need to be a little bit aware
[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:17.480]   of having some reality check, listening to your body
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:20.600]   but then also being like, hey, no, I'm talking to you.
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:22.740]   I'm telling you this is the plan we're going to do this
[02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:24.580]   and staying within it.
[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:28.740]   It is going to be challenging to progressively overload
[02:56:28.740 --> 02:56:32.460]   and therefore get a higher likelihood
[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:34.420]   of success at your training program.
[02:56:34.420 --> 02:56:37.500]   If you're just making decisions and changing the program
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:40.300]   right before you work out, you're probably not,
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:41.820]   you're probably going, for most people,
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:44.940]   you're probably going to choose less or off
[02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:47.820]   more so than you choose more.
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:51.500]   Now having said that, there are more than a few clients
[02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:52.800]   that have come through our programs
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:56.820]   where they choose more always.
[02:56:56.820 --> 02:56:59.200]   They add a set, they add an exercise,
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:02.740]   they add another workout and that can be okay
[02:57:02.740 --> 02:57:05.000]   but we're going to attract various markers on them
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.940]   and if we see these things consistently going down,
[02:57:07.940 --> 02:57:09.700]   we're going to identify whether they are,
[02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:12.620]   which phase of this overtraining thing we'll talk about next
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:13.660]   they're actually in.
[02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:16.940]   Some phases I'm okay, some of them I'm not.
[02:57:16.940 --> 02:57:20.380]   If we're seeing certain things happen physiologically,
[02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:22.060]   we're going to make a conversation.
[02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:25.660]   We're also then going to really think carefully
[02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:28.620]   about why are you making this choice?
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:30.820]   Do you feel like the training isn't enough?
[02:57:30.820 --> 02:57:33.740]   Okay, great, let's modify it then.
[02:57:33.740 --> 02:57:35.180]   Are you not making progress?
[02:57:35.180 --> 02:57:38.100]   Or are there some other reasons why you're doing this?
[02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:40.820]   Obviously I'm not a psychologist or therapist
[02:57:40.820 --> 02:57:43.420]   but there are clearly situations in which folks
[02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:46.940]   dose themselves with far too much exercise for reasons
[02:57:46.940 --> 02:57:49.120]   that are not because it's productive
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:50.420]   to their training or goals.
[02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:53.420]   And if such case, we would probably bring in somebody
[02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:56.180]   that specializes in those areas to clear that out
[02:57:56.180 --> 02:57:57.980]   and just make sure it's like we're not doing this
[02:57:57.980 --> 02:58:02.980]   for anxiety issues or energy, things like.
[02:58:02.980 --> 02:58:05.060]   If it's I just don't think the program's enough,
[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:07.260]   okay, great, let's go back, let's look at our metrics,
[02:58:07.260 --> 02:58:08.920]   let's evaluate our tests and go there.
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:11.740]   But if there's other reasons then we may bring in somebody
[02:58:11.740 --> 02:58:13.260]   to have that conversation.
[02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:15.620]   - Yeah, usually when I've seen people deviate from programs
[02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:17.500]   it's because they tend to revert to something
[02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:18.660]   that they've done for a long time.
[02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:22.220]   It just feels really comfortable to them and it worked.
[02:58:22.220 --> 02:58:24.100]   And it was giving them decent results
[02:58:24.100 --> 02:58:26.060]   so they're skeptical to try something else.
[02:58:26.060 --> 02:58:30.860]   Or there is a phenotype of kind of haphazardness sometimes
[02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:32.620]   especially if you get really caffeinated before workout
[02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:33.660]   and just want to throw something in.
[02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:35.220]   Then there's a third category and this is one
[02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:37.580]   that I've had to contend with a lot in my life
[02:58:37.580 --> 02:58:40.120]   which is that I really enjoy training with other people
[02:58:40.120 --> 02:58:41.540]   when I have the opportunity.
[02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:43.580]   And a certain day rolls around where you're supposed
[02:58:43.580 --> 02:58:45.380]   to do something and not do other things.
[02:58:45.380 --> 02:58:46.580]   And people say, hey, do you want to go
[02:58:46.580 --> 02:58:48.840]   for a long ocean swim or you want to train
[02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:52.780]   and you end up doing some, Kenny Kane, this one's for you,
[02:58:52.780 --> 02:58:56.960]   some ridiculous 20 wall ball CrossFit type workout
[02:58:56.960 --> 02:58:59.760]   and I'm not acclimated for that sort of thing.
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:02.060]   And then it does tend to throw things off.
[02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:04.680]   Not because, no pun intended, Kenny,
[02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:08.380]   because there's nothing wrong with 20 sets of wall balls
[02:59:08.380 --> 02:59:10.060]   that's part of your conditioning.
[02:59:10.060 --> 02:59:11.700]   But if it's not appropriate for where you are
[02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:13.720]   in your schedule, it really can disrupt
[02:59:13.720 --> 02:59:15.300]   what you're trying to do.
[02:59:15.300 --> 02:59:18.540]   Even as a non-competitive athlete like myself,
[02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:21.620]   the year has been since I've competed
[02:59:21.620 --> 02:59:25.020]   in any athletic program, but as a non-competitive athlete,
[02:59:25.020 --> 02:59:30.020]   I think there's a beauty to and a really strong incentive
[02:59:30.020 --> 02:59:34.840]   to being disciplined about the program that one follows.
[02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:37.960]   As a mentor and professor that I worked with years ago
[02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:40.320]   used to say, come into his office, all these ideas
[02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:42.540]   and things I want to do and he'd say,
[02:59:42.540 --> 02:59:44.600]   let's constrain this walk.
[02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:47.100]   And then the question you always want to arrive at
[02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:48.680]   in a discussion with your students, as you know,
[02:59:48.680 --> 02:59:50.560]   is what's the experiment exactly?
[02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:52.800]   And then you go and you do that specific experiment.
[02:59:52.800 --> 02:59:55.120]   I think I view a workout the same way,
[02:59:55.120 --> 02:59:58.120]   that there are multiple adaptations, goals,
[02:59:58.120 --> 03:00:00.080]   and things that people are trying to achieve.
[03:00:00.080 --> 03:00:02.040]   Really knowing why you're there each time
[03:00:02.040 --> 03:00:03.780]   and really sticking to that,
[03:00:03.780 --> 03:00:06.160]   even if it means not training with other people.
[03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:07.920]   Or I always say, well, you can train with me,
[03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:09.640]   but I'm not going to train with you.
[03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:10.480]   - Selfish.
[03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:12.520]   - Right, so that's one way to do it.
[03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:14.120]   But really sticking to a schedule
[03:00:14.120 --> 03:00:16.440]   is really what allows the progress to emerge,
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:19.200]   but that doesn't necessarily mean being antisocial.
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:21.400]   You can invite people along, but in this case,
[03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:23.760]   I'm telling people to be the host, not the guest.
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:25.560]   - I have a little bit of a rule here.
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:27.720]   Maybe I should answer your question this way.
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:32.040]   I actually like doing things totally different occasionally.
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:35.360]   So I'll do, when I'm traveling, I tend to do hotel workouts.
[03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:38.920]   What I mean by that is I will go down to the workout room
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:42.620]   and I will do a set of 10 to 15 reps of every single machine
[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:45.300]   in the exact order in which they are laid out.
[03:00:45.300 --> 03:00:46.140]   - Whoa.
[03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:47.440]   - Just for the sake of fun.
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:48.760]   Like just for the sake of like-
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:50.680]   - It's like a tarot card version of workouts.
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:51.520]   - Yeah, totally.
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:53.400]   - Like whatever comes up, I'm going to make sense of it.
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:54.760]   - And you just move.
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:56.400]   And those are typically things of like,
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:58.880]   I just want to move a little bit for jet lag
[03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:01.420]   and other sort of purposes, right?
[03:01:01.420 --> 03:01:04.040]   That's often like I wasn't going to get to work out today.
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:06.600]   And so now I'm going to do something to feel great.
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:08.880]   I don't travel that much though.
[03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:11.520]   So it's not really throwing my things off.
[03:01:11.520 --> 03:01:16.000]   I also, I don't get a lot of free time.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:19.120]   And so if I am traveling and I'm seeing someone
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:22.740]   I haven't seen in many years or for the first time,
[03:01:22.740 --> 03:01:24.240]   I mean, we got to train together this week
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:26.900]   for the first time, I'm not going to burn that opportunity.
[03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:29.240]   My rule is this though, I'm not going to do something
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:31.800]   that's going to cost me more than three days.
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:35.400]   So I'm absolutely happy to get out there
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:36.720]   and maybe tomorrow morning or tonight,
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:39.400]   we go do some fun that's off my schedule.
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:41.320]   I'm in, I'm in a hundred percent.
[03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:42.960]   I'm just going to downregulate a little bit.
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:44.360]   I'm not going to maybe do as much as you
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:46.240]   or as hard as you or whatever.
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:48.240]   I'll do more than I should.
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:51.960]   But if it costs me tomorrow, it was worth the exchange.
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:54.840]   I don't have a world record I'm setting anytime soon.
[03:01:54.840 --> 03:01:56.920]   I don't have, I got many years.
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:00.400]   I am happy to give up a couple of days of exercise
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:02.520]   to be a little sore than I need to be
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:05.220]   for the exchange of a lifetime memory.
[03:02:05.220 --> 03:02:07.300]   And this stuff is so important to me.
[03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:10.680]   This stuff lands as like true lifetime memories.
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:13.360]   I can look back, many of my fond memories from my life
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:15.480]   are training sessions with friends, whatever it is,
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:19.000]   like doing jiu-jitsu with somebody who's a world champion.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:20.800]   We just like totally, whatever the thing is, right?
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:22.320]   You're like, that was really, really cool.
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:23.720]   Absolutely worth missing two days.
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:25.320]   If it's going to be more than three days though,
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:27.000]   where like I'm going to be so wrecked,
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.520]   I can't work out for five or six days.
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:31.760]   Then I'm probably like, all right, that's kind of nonsense.
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:33.200]   Unless it's just like an opportunity where I'm like,
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:35.400]   I absolutely can't pass up, you know?
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:38.040]   So that's kind of how I think about it.
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:40.160]   That doesn't happen too often with me though,
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:41.120]   maybe once a month.
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:43.520]   And so I'm like, okay, I'm fine, I lost a day.
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:45.440]   Reality of it is it's probably more like once a quarter
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:46.680]   that that happens, so I don't really care.
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:51.680]   So you do want to balance joy and life.
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:54.960]   You don't want to be so rigid about your training program
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:02:57.040]   that it ruins and robs those experiences.
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:01.920]   Physical activity should be fun.
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:03.640]   Your fitness and your training should be something
[03:03:03.640 --> 03:03:04.760]   that makes your life better.
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:08.720]   Not some task you have to get done
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:11.560]   so that 75 years from now,
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:14.680]   you've hit some metric of who knows what.
[03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:16.960]   - Just alone in your room with your training logs.
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:18.360]   (laughing)
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:20.360]   No, in all seriousness,
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:22.360]   I think you point to the richness of life
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:24.540]   and you know, you can draw these boxes like work,
[03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:26.040]   relationships, fitness, recovery,
[03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:28.560]   but the boundaries between those boxes are blurry
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:31.440]   because, and I should say, I love training with you.
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:33.360]   I greatly enjoyed training with you this morning,
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:35.920]   not just because I was receiving so many useful tips.
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:36.960]   In fact, thank you.
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:39.320]   It's the first time I've PR'd in a number of things today.
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:41.440]   Thanks to your input in the moment.
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:43.640]   That's an irreplaceable kind of gift,
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:45.220]   but mostly it's the gift of getting to train
[03:03:45.220 --> 03:03:46.320]   with a colleague and friend.
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:49.400]   So I want to underscore highlight
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:52.720]   and put an exclamation mark behind what you just said.
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:57.480]   Thank you once again and again for giving us
[03:03:57.480 --> 03:04:02.120]   so much interesting, clear, actionable,
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:05.200]   and at times somewhat counterintuitive information
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:09.760]   in order to build out an exceptional training program
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:12.220]   to meet any of, and in some cases,
[03:04:12.220 --> 03:04:15.940]   all of the nine major adaptations that exercise can create
[03:04:15.940 --> 03:04:18.440]   toward aesthetic, performance-related,
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:23.160]   and healthspan, lifespan, aka longevity goals.
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:26.400]   That's really a treasure trove of information there.
[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:28.840]   And I look forward to our next discussion
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:31.700]   about how to best recover from exercise,
[03:04:31.700 --> 03:04:36.520]   both within the exercise bout and between exercise bouts
[03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:39.360]   and in the more macroscopic structure of a week,
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:41.200]   a month, a year.
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:42.480]   I can't wait.
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:43.440]   - Yeah, I can't wait either.
[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:46.320]   I love that topic and I've got a lot to cover,
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:48.240]   so it'd be fun.

[03:05:16.660 --> 03:05:19.080]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[03:05:19.080 --> 03:05:20.060]   I'd also like to inform you
[03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:22.580]   about the Huberman Lab Podcast free newsletter.
[03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:24.380]   It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:27.360]   And each month, the Neural Network Newsletter is sent out
[03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:29.840]   and it contains summaries of podcast episodes,
[03:05:29.840 --> 03:05:32.740]   specific protocols discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:36.580]   all in fairly concise format and all completely zero cost.
[03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:38.280]   You can sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter
[03:05:38.280 --> 03:05:40.000]   by going to HubermanLab.com,
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:41.940]   go to the menu and click on Newsletter.
[03:05:41.940 --> 03:05:42.960]   You provide us your email.
[03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:44.560]   We do not share it with anybody.
[03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:47.020]   And as I mentioned before, it's completely zero cost.
[03:05:47.020 --> 03:05:48.820]   By going to HubermanLab.com,
[03:05:48.820 --> 03:05:51.600]   you can also go into the menu tab and go to Newsletter
[03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:54.340]   and see some example newsletters from months past.
[03:05:54.340 --> 03:05:56.580]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[03:05:56.580 --> 03:05:58.560]   about fitness, exercise and performance
[03:05:58.560 --> 03:06:00.060]   with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[03:06:00.060 --> 03:06:03.020]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[03:06:03.020 --> 03:06:05.600]   (upbeat music)
[03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:08.180]   (upbeat music)
