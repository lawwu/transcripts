[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380]   I would run outside and just lay on the ground under the southern Milky Way, beautiful right
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.140]   up there.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.300]   And I would just lay there like the snow angel and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300]   through my brain.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.380]   And this is when I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.620]   I belong here, rather than feeling kind of small.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.960]   Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things, and lots of small things make one
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   big whole.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.800]   The following is a conversation with Anna Frabel, an astrophysicist at MIT, studying
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.840]   the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy in order to understand the chemical and physical
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   conditions of the early universe, and how from that, our galaxy formed and evolved to
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.440]   what it is today, the place we humans call home.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.960]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.600]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description, and now, dear friends,
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.440]   here's Anna Frabel.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.040]   Let's go back to the early days.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.960]   What did the formation of the Milky Way galaxy look like?
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.080]   Or maybe we want to start even before that.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.080]   What did the formation of the universe look like?
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.200]   Well, we scientists believe there was the Big Bang, some big beginning.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.440]   But what is important for my work, and I think that's what we're going to talk about, is
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.520]   what kind of elements were present at that time.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.800]   So the Big Bang left a universe behind that was made of just hydrogen and helium, and
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.200]   tiny little sprinkles of lithium.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.980]   And that was pretty much it.
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.840]   As it turns out, it's actually quite hard to make stars or any structure from that.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.960]   That's fairly hot gas.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.400]   And so the very first stars that formed prior to any galaxies were very massive stars, big
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.240]   stars, 100 times the mass of the Sun, and they were made from just hydrogen and helium.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.760]   So big stars explode pretty fast after a few million years only.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.840]   That's very short on cosmic time scales.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.400]   And in their explosions, they provided the first heavier elements to the universe because
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.440]   in their cores, all stars fuse lighter elements like hydrogen and helium into heavier ones.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.840]   And then that goes all the way up to iron, and then all that material gets ejected in
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.960]   these massive supernova explosions.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.120]   And that marked a really, really important transition in the universe because after that
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.080]   first explosion, it was no longer chemically pristine.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.000]   And that set the stage for everything else to happen, including us here talking today.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.960]   - So what do you mean by pristine?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   So there's a whole complex soup of elements now as opposed to just hydrogen, helium, and
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.840]   a little bit of lithium.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.320]   - Yeah, so after the Big Bang, just hydrogen and helium.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.800]   We don't really need to talk too much about lithium because the amount was so small.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.960]   And after these very first stars formed and exploded, heavier elements like carbon, oxygen,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.280]   magnesium, iron, all of that stuff was suddenly present in the gas clouds.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   Tiny amounts only, very tiny amounts.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.720]   But that actually helped, especially the carbon and the oxygen, to make the gas cool.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.840]   These atoms are more complicated than hydrogen.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's just a proton, and so it has cooling properties, can send out photons outside of
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.440]   the gas cloud so the gas can cool.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.600]   And when you have gas that gets colder and colder, you can make smaller and smaller stars.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.560]   So you can fragment it and clump it and turn it into stars like the Sun.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.200]   And the cool thing about that is that when you have small stars like the Sun, they have
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.380]   a really long lifetime.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.700]   So those first low-mass stars that formed back then are still observable today.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.880]   That is actually what I do.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.960]   I try to find these early survivors because they tell us what the gas looked like back
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   then.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.800]   They have preserved that composition of these early gas clouds, the chemical compositions,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.200]   until today.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.740]   So I don't need to look very far into the universe to study all the beginnings.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.400]   I can just chemically analyze the oldest stars, and it's like unpacking everything that happened
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   back then.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   It's exciting.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.960]   - So to just reiterate, so in the very early days in the first few million years, there
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.760]   was giant stars that's mostly hydrogen and helium, and then they exploded in these supernova
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.960]   explosions, and then they made these clumps.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.120]   - Yeah, so the first stars--
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   - Non-pristine.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   (laughing)
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   Non-pristine clumps.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   - Yeah, pretty much.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   - Fun.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.000]   - So it took a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge, and then they exploded
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.960]   after a few million years.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.000]   Kaboom.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.080]   And then it's like, I always consider the universe like a nice soup, and then these
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.440]   first supernova explosions kind of provided the salt, just a little sprinkle of heavier
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.600]   elements, and that made it really tasty.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.000]   Just changed it completely, right?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.400]   And that changed the physics of the gas, so that meant that these gas clouds that were
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.240]   surrounding the former first stars, they could now cool down and clump and form the
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.000]   next generation of stars that now included also little stars.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.920]   And as I just mentioned, the small stars have these really long lifetimes.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   The Sun has a lifetime of 10 billion years.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.480]   Any star that is even less massive will have an even longer lifetime.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.600]   So that gives us a chance to still observe some of the stars that formed back then.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.480]   So we are testing the conditions, the chemical and physical conditions of the early universe
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.200]   even before the galaxy formed.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.240]   - So what's the timeline that we're talking about?
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.640]   What is the age of the universe, and what is the earliest time we got those salty, delicious
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.800]   soup, clump soups with heavier elements?
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.200]   - Well the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   - Allegedly, yeah.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   Is it?
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   - Yes.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   - Okay, 13.8, sorry.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.120]   - Well, you know, when I was in high school, the universe was 20 billion years old.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.120]   - Oh yeah?
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   - So the estimate-- - Things have changed.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.240]   - Do you think that estimate will evolve in interesting ways or no?
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   Is it pretty stable at this point?
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.840]   - I think we have mostly converged, yes.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.240]   Because the techniques are very different now, much more precise.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.200]   The whole business of precision cosmology by mapping out the cosmic microwave background,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.720]   you know, that's a marvelous feat.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.800]   Maybe the digits will still move around a little bit, but that's all right.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.880]   - Plus the gravitational waves and all that.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.640]   So all the different sources of data, kind of mapping out this detailed picture of the
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   early universe.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   - Totally.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.720]   And so we think the earliest little stars formed, I don't know, maybe half a billion
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.600]   years after the Big Bang, right?
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.000]   Again a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge, and then it took some
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   time.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.600]   So give or take half a billion years.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.400]   And that was the time when sort of the very first proto-galaxies formed, early stellar
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.720]   structures, stellar systems, from which the Mickey eventually formed, right?
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.400]   So the Mickey was probably a bigger, slightly bigger one.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.080]   And we know today that galaxies grow hierarchically, which means they eat their smaller neighbors.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:44.360]   So if you're the bigger one and have a few friends around, you're just gonna eat them,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.120]   absorb them, and then you grow bigger.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.200]   And so all these little early stars kind of came into the Mickey way through that kind
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.160]   of process, and that's why we find them in the outer parts of the galaxy today, because
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.700]   they're just kind of left there since.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.640]   - So the old stuff is on the outskirts of the galaxy, and the new stuff is closer to
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   the middle?
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   - Broadly speaking, yes.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.960]   - So that's where you would look for it.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.280]   So maybe just to step back, what is a galaxy, what is a proto-galaxy?
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.420]   - I love that question.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:23.560]   So the galaxy is a huge assembly of stars.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:30.320]   The Mickey Way contains something like 200 to 400 billion stars, and most of the material
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.680]   and the stars are in the disk.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   And when we look at the night sky, what we see as the Mickey Way band on the sky, that
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:47.520]   is actually the next inner spiral arm, because we actually live in a spiral disk galaxy,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.760]   so the Mickey Way is a spiral disk galaxy.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.740]   And we're looking, actually it depends a little bit in the northern hemisphere, we're looking
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:03.040]   out of the galaxy, so we're seeing the next outer spiral arm.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.360]   And as you can imagine, there's only dark space behind that, so we don't see it all
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.800]   that nice on the sky, but if you travel to the southern hemisphere, let's say South America,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.760]   you see the Mickey Way and it looks so different on the sky because that's the next inner spiral
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.640]   arm, and that's backlit by the galactic center.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:32.000]   The galactic center is a very big, puffy region of gas, there's a lot of star formation, the
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.160]   galactic party is happening there, so it's very bright, and it makes for this very beautiful
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.240]   Mickey Way on the night sky that we see.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:45.120]   So actually, if you ever get the chance to experience that, I encourage you to almost
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.600]   like close your eyes while seeing this and imagining that you're sitting in this kind
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.960]   of disk, in this pancake, and you're just kind of looking right into it, and you can
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.640]   really feel that we're in this 2D disk, and then you can imagine that there's a top and
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.040]   a bottom, and that we're really part of the galaxy, you can really experience that.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.520]   We're not just lost in space somewhere, but we're really a part of it, and knowing a little
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.840]   bit about the structure of the Mickey Way really helps.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.080]   - Do you feel small when you think about that?
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.320]   When you look on the spiral on the inside of the Mickey Way, and then you look out to
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.200]   the outside, how are we supposed to feel?
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:32.640]   - I don't know, I don't feel small necessarily, I feel in awe, and I feel I'm a part of it,
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.440]   because I can really feel that I'm a part of it.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.600]   I think for many people, they think like, "Oh, there's just the planet, and then there's
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   nothing."
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.040]   And that's almost a little bit sad, but that's really not the case, right?
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.720]   Because there's so much more, and I really like to imagine, wow, I'm sitting in this
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.880]   big galactic merry-go-round, and we're going around the center, and I can see the center
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   above me, right, and I can almost feel like we're going there.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.480]   Of course, we can't really feel that, but the sun does circle the galactic center.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.840]   - But there's a kind of sadness to looking pictures of a nice vacation place.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.760]   All we get is that light, an old light.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.520]   Do you feel sad that we don't get to travel, or you and I will not get to travel there,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.760]   and maybe humans will never get to travel there?
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.040]   - Yeah, I always wanted to travel into space and see the Earth and other things from up
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   there.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.760]   There's certainly that, but I don't know.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.000]   It's also okay to just be at our vantage point and see it from here.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.880]   - With the sensors, with the telescopes that we have, and explore the possibility.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.560]   There is a kind of wonder to the mystery of it all, what's out there, what interesting
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.760]   things that we can't possibly imagine.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.520]   There could be all kinds of life forms, bacteria, all this kind of stuff.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.560]   I tend to believe that, it depends on the day, I tend to believe there's just a lot
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.400]   of very primitive organisms just spread out throughout, and they built their little things
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.480]   like bacteria-type organisms, just to think what kind of worlds there are, 'cause they're
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.720]   probably really creative living organisms.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.800]   'Cause the conditions, I guess the question I'm wondering to myself when I look out there
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.160]   to the stars, how different are the conditions on the different planets that orbit those
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   stars?
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.760]   - It will definitely be very different.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.700]   I mean, the variety out there is huge.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:41.840]   We know now that I think it's about every other star has at least one planet.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.400]   I already mentioned the number of stars in the galaxy.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:52.200]   I mean, it's a huge number of planets out there, so who knows what that looks like.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.040]   All we know is that there is a lot of variety.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:02.420]   We don't quite yet understand what drives that, what governs that, why that is the case,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.360]   why is it not all one size fits all?
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.840]   - You mean the dynamics of planet formation, like exoplanet formation, or star formation,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   the whole--
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.560]   - All of it, all of it.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.520]   Star formation remains a much-researched topic.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.620]   We definitely know that it works, because all the stars are there.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.200]   Same for the planets.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.080]   But the details are so varied per gas cloud, right?
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.200]   It's very hard to come up with very detailed prescriptions.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   Broadly we have figured it out.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.920]   You need a gas cloud, you need to cool it, something clumps and fragments, and somehow
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.320]   it makes a star with planets or without.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.160]   - But the dynamics of the clumping process is not fully understood.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160]   - No, no.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.980]   The local conditions are so varied, right?
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.900]   I mean, it's the same with, all people look like people, but individually we look very
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.900]   different.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.460]   - So even the subtle diversity of the formation process creates all kinds of fun differences.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.580]   - Yes, so we just don't know how this turned out in an individual case.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:14.420]   And it's kind of hard to figure it all out and to take a look, certainly with planets,
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:21.020]   the chance to ever actually take a picture of a planet is minuscule, because they don't
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.260]   shine, so they're really dark.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:29.860]   So I'd say there's a lot of possibility out there, but we have to be a little bit more
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.100]   patient before we--
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:38.380]   - Come up with technologies where patience becomes less necessary by extending our lifetimes
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.940]   or increasing the speed of space travel, all that kind of stuff.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.420]   Humans are pretty intelligent.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   - Sometimes, yeah.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:52.580]   - For the most part, I hope, on the optimistic days.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:15:00.420]   Well maybe just to linger on what a galaxy is, what should we know about our understanding
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.540]   of black holes in the formation?
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.060]   Is that an important thing to understand in the formation of a galaxy?
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.660]   So all the orbiting, all the spiraling that's going on, how important is that to understand?
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.540]   - All of the above.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.460]   That's what makes astronomy really hard, but also really interesting, right?
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.060]   No day is like another because we always find something new.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.900]   I want to come back to the idea of the proto-galaxy because it actually matches or relates to
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.500]   the black hole formation.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:33.580]   So most large, well pretty much all large galaxies have a supermassive black hole in
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.660]   the center, and we don't actually know, we don't really know where they come from.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.020]   Again, we know that they are there, but how do we get there?
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.220]   So we go back to the early universe, right?
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:54.220]   We had a little galaxy that just sort of, I don't know, had some small number of stars.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:16:00.220]   It was the first gravitationally bound structure that was held together by dark matter because
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:06.780]   dark matter actually kind of structured up first before the luminous matter could because
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.740]   that's what dark matter kind of does.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:16.820]   And it started to hold gas and then stars sort of together in these first very shallow,
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.100]   what we call potential wells, so these gravitationally bound systems.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:27.260]   And then the Milky Way grew from absorbing neighboring smaller, even smaller systems.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:34.980]   And somewhere in that process, there must have been a seed for one of these supermassive
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.980]   black holes, and I'm not actually sure that it's clear right now kind of what was there
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.540]   first, the supermassive black hole or the galaxy.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.700]   So lots of people are trying to study that, and of course the black hole wasn't as massive
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.780]   back then as it is these days.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:17:00.980]   But it's a big area of research, and the new James Webb, the JWT, the telescope, the infrared
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:09.380]   telescope in space is working on, many people are working on that to figure out exactly
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.380]   what happened.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.060]   And there are some surprising results that we really don't understand right now.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.540]   - So to solve the chicken or the egg problem of do you need a supermassive black hole to
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.460]   form a galaxy, or does the galaxy naturally create the supermassive black hole?
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.700]   I mean, I think to some degree we can answer that because there are lots of little dwarf
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.940]   galaxies out there.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:37.820]   The Milky Way remains surrounded by many dozens of small dwarf galaxies.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.900]   I have studied a bunch of them, and to the extent that we can tell, they do not contain
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.580]   black holes.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.100]   So there certainly were gravitationally bound structures, so either you can call them proto-galaxies
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.700]   or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies, they were definitely there.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:00.580]   But there must have been bigger things like the proto-Milky Way where something was different,
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   right?
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.940]   What made them more massive so that they would gravitationally attract these smaller systems
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.540]   to integrate them.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.180]   So we'll have to see.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:17.980]   - How do we look into that, into the dynamics of the formation, the evolution of the proto-galaxies?
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.980]   Is it possible?
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.980]   Do they shine?
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.180]   I mean, what are the set of data that we can possibly look at?
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:31.140]   So we got gravitational waves, which is really insane that we can even detect those.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.060]   There's light.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.060]   What else can we--
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:40.540]   - So that would fall into the category of observational cosmology, and the JWT is the
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:47.220]   prime telescope right now, and it promises big, big steps forward.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:53.220]   This is in its early days because it's only been online like a year or so.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:19:01.260]   And that collects the infrared light from the farthest, like literally proto-galaxies,
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.820]   earliest galaxies.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.780]   That light has traveled some 13 billion years to us, and they're observing these faint little
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.060]   blobs.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:17.460]   And folks are trying to, again, study the onset of these early supermassive black holes,
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.940]   how they shape galaxies.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:24.900]   So they're seeing that they were there, surrounded by already bigger galaxies.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.940]   Ideally, I'd like for my colleagues to push a little bit further.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.620]   Hopefully that will eventually happen.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.460]   - In terms of looking towards older and older ones.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.620]   - Yeah, yeah, more and more sort of primitive in terms of the structure.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.300]   But of course, as you can imagine, if you make your system smaller and smaller, it becomes
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.700]   dimmer and dimmer, and it's further and further away.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.900]   So we're reaching the end of the line from a technical perspective pretty quickly.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.940]   - But dimmer and dimmer means older and older.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.420]   - Yes, in a sense, because it all started really small.
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.020]   - Because it's smaller and smaller, which correlates to older and older.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.860]   - In that phase of the universe, it would, otherwise it doesn't.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:12.680]   - Just to take a small attention about black holes, because you do quite a bit of observational
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:19.940]   cosmology and maybe experimental astrophysics.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.620]   What's the difference to you between theoretical physics and experimental?
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:29.100]   So there's a lot of really interesting explorations about paradoxes around black holes and all
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:34.020]   this kind of stuff, about black holes destroying information.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.500]   Do those worlds intermix to you, especially when you step away from your work and kind
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.180]   of think about the mystery of it all?
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:46.340]   - Well, at first glance, there isn't actually much crosstalk.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:53.140]   Personally, I mostly observe stars, so I don't usually actually think too much about black
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.140]   holes.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.060]   - And stars is a fundamentally kind of chemical, physical phenomena that doesn't...
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.060]   - That's right.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.060]   The physics is kind of different.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.060]   It's not extreme.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:06.220]   I mean, you know, you could consider nuclear fusion sort of be perhaps extreme.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.220]   You need to tunnel.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.220]   There's some interesting physics there.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.900]   - But it's just a different flavor.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:19.700]   I don't do these kinds of calculations myself either.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.940]   I very much like to talk with my theory colleagues about these things, though, because I find
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.820]   there's always an interesting intersection.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.860]   And often, it's just...
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:37.500]   I've written a number of papers with colleagues who do simulations about galaxies, and so
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.700]   they're not quite as far removed as, let's say, the black hole pen and paper folks.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:48.340]   But even in those cases, we had the same interests and the same topics, but it was almost like
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.060]   we're speaking two different languages.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.980]   And we weren't even that far removed, you know, both astronomers and all.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:02.500]   And it was really interesting just to take the time and really try to talk to each other.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.540]   And it's amazing how hard that is.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.420]   You know, even amongst scientists, we already have trouble talking to each other.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:18.860]   Imagine how hard it is to talk to non-scientists and other people to try, you know, to...
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.140]   We're all interested in the same things as humans at the end of the day, right?
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.060]   But everyone has sort of a different angle about it and different questions and way of
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:33.300]   formulating things, and sometimes it really takes a while to converge and to get, you
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.860]   know, to the common ground.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.180]   But if you take the time, it's so interesting to participate in that process.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.140]   And it feels so good in the end to say like, "Yes, we tackled this together," right?
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.540]   We overcame our differences, not so much in opinion, but just in expressing ourselves
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.900]   about this and how we go about solving a problem.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.580]   And these were some of my most successful papers, and I certainly enjoyed them the most.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.380]   - It could also lead to big discoveries.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.380]   I mean, there's a...
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.020]   I think you put it really well in saying that we're all kind of studying the same kind of
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.260]   mysteries and problems.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.580]   I mean, I see this in the space of artificial intelligence.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.180]   You have a community, maybe it seems very far away, artificial intelligence and neuroscience.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.380]   You know, you would think that they're studying very different things, but one is trying to
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.380]   engineer intelligence and in so doing, try to understand intelligence.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.380]   And the other is trying to understand intelligence and cognition in the human mind.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.940]   And they're just doing it from a different set of data, a different set of backgrounds,
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.900]   and the researchers that do that kind of work.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:41.500]   And probably the same is true in observational cosmology and simulation.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:47.540]   So it's like a fundamentally different approach to understanding the universe.
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:53.460]   Let me use, for simulation, let me use the things I know to create a bunch of parameters
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.180]   and create some...
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.420]   Just play with it.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.060]   Play with the universe.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.820]   Play God.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.060]   Create a bunch of universes and see in a way that matches experimental data.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   It's a fun...
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.140]   It's like playing Sims, but at the cosmic level.
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.140]   - Yes, yes.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.500]   - And then probably the set of terminology used there is very different.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.340]   And maybe you're allowed to break the rules a little bit more.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.060]   Let's have, you know, yeah, it's like the Drake equation.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.420]   Yeah, you don't really know.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.700]   You kind of come up with a bunch of values here and there and just see how it evolves.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.340]   And from that, kind of intuit the different possibilities, the dynamics of the evolution
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.180]   of a galaxy, for example.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.340]   Yeah, but it's cool to play between those two.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.620]   Because it seems like we understand so little about our cosmos.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.780]   So it's good to play.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.340]   - Yes, it's like a big sandbox, right?
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.780]   And everyone kind of has their little corner and they do things, but we're all in the same
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.300]   sandbox together at the end of the day.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   - But in that sandbox does have super powerful and super expensive telescopes.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.180]   That everybody's also...
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.740]   All the children are fighting for the resources to make sure they get to ask the right questions
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.940]   using that big cool tool.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:09.980]   Well, can we actually step back on the big field of stellar archeology?
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.980]   What is this process?
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.980]   Can you just speak to it again?
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:16.780]   I know you've been speaking to it, but what is this process of archeology in the cosmos?
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.420]   - Yeah, it's really fascinating.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:27.660]   So I mentioned the lesser the mass of the star, the longer it lives.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:33.380]   And again, for reference, for the next dinner party, the sun's lifetime is 10 billion years.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:40.940]   So if you have a star that's 0.6 or 0.8 solar masses, then its lifetime is going to be 15
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   to 20 billion years.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:48.340]   And that's an important range for our conversation because again, if you assume that such a small
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:53.280]   star formed soon after the Big Bang, then it is still observable today.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.860]   You mentioned old light before.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.460]   That light is like a few thousand years old, but compared to the age of these stars is
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.100]   nothing.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.980]   So to me, that's young.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.780]   Because straight from our galaxy, these stars are not far away.
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.100]   They're in our galaxy in the outskirts.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:22.300]   They probably did not form in the galaxy because again, hierarchical assembly of a Milky Way
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   meant...
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   - They were eaten.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   - Exactly.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.580]   They formed in a little other galaxy in the vicinity.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.220]   And at some point, the Milky Way ate that, which means it absorbed all the stars, including
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.860]   these little old stars that are now in the outskirts of the Milky Way that I used to
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.180]   point my telescope to.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.620]   So what can we learn from these stars?
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:42.740]   Why should we study them?
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:48.660]   Now these little stars are really, really efficient with their energy consumption.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.260]   They're still burning, for the experts, just burning hydrogen to helium in their cores,
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:58.780]   and they have done so for the past 12, 13 billion years, however old they are.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.540]   And they're going to keep doing that for another few billion years, same as the Sun.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:07.820]   The Sun also just does hydrogen to helium burning and will continue that for a while.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:15.540]   Which means the outer parts of the star, well, pretty much actually most of the star, that
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.180]   gas doesn't talk to the core.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:27.460]   So whatever composition that star has, you know, in its outer layers, is exactly the
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.220]   same as the gas composition from which the star formed.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:38.780]   Which means it has perfectly preserved that information from way back then all the way
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.100]   to today and going forward.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:49.340]   So I'm a stellar archaeologist because I don't dig in the dirt to find remnants of past civilizations
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.700]   and whatnot.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:57.900]   I dig for the old stars in the sky because they have preserved that information from
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:05.860]   those first billion years in their outer stellar atmosphere, which is what I'm observing with
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.860]   telescopes.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:12.860]   So I'm getting the best look at the chemical composition early on that you could possibly
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.860]   wish for.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.860]   - What kind of age are we talking about here?
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:22.100]   Are we talking about something that's close to that, you know, like a 13 billion, 12,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.980]   13 billion age range?
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.420]   - That's what we think.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.300]   Now there's a small caveat here.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:35.820]   We can not accurately date these stars, but we use a trick to say, "Oh, these stars must
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.700]   have formed as some of the earliest generations of stars."
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.140]   Because we need to talk about the chemical evolution of the universe and the Milky Way
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.540]   for a second.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:51.580]   So I already mentioned the pristineness of the universe after the Big Bang, right?
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.100]   Just hydrogen and helium.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:59.180]   Then the first stars formed, they produced a sprinkle of heavier elements up to iron.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.620]   Then the next generation of stars formed.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:07.460]   That included, again, massive stars that they would explode again, but also the little ones
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.380]   that keep on living, right?
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.420]   And then the massive ones, again, exploded supernova, so they provide, again, another
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.940]   sprinkle of heavier elements.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.780]   And so over time, all the elements in the periodic table have been built up.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:27.620]   There have been other processes, for example, neutron star mergers and other exotic supernovae
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.060]   that have provided elements heavier than iron, all the way up to uranium, from very early
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.060]   on.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.660]   We're still trying to figure out those details.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:44.140]   But I always say pretty much all the elements were done from day three.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:50.060]   - So iron is where, once you get to iron, you got all the fun you need, most of the
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.060]   fun.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.060]   - Yes, I know.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:58.820]   I really like the heavier elements, gold, silver, platinum, that kind of stuff.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.940]   - For personal reasons or for star formation?
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.380]   - Well, both.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:08.660]   - What's the importance of these heavier metals in the evolution of the stars?
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.040]   - So they're the spice of life, right?
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.020]   So every supernova gives you elements up to iron.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.440]   That's cool, but at some point it gets a little bit boring, because that always works.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.460]   But that's the baseline.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.620]   We need that.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:30.300]   And that's certainly what came out of the first stars, and then all the other supernova
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.860]   explosions that followed with every generation.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.260]   And it took about a thousand generations, give or take, until the sun was made.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:44.100]   So the sun formed from a gas cloud that was enriched by roughly a thousand generations
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:51.820]   of supernova explosions, and that's why the sun has the chemical composition that it has,
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.980]   and somehow the planets were made from that as well.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.700]   - So the supernova explosions of the many generations are creating more and more complex
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.700]   elements.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:06.220]   - No, it just goes all the way up to iron, and then it's a little bit more of all of
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.220]   these elements.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   - Just more.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.420]   - Yeah, it's one sprinkle, then another, and it just kind of adds up, right?
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.900]   Now the heavy elements form in very different ways.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.100]   They are not fusion-made.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:23.260]   They are made typically through neutron capture processes, but for that you need seed nuclei,
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.040]   particularly iron or carbon or something.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.340]   So the supernova-made elements are very good seed nuclei for other processes that then
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.100]   create heavy elements.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:41.180]   And because they cannot be made everywhere, some of my stars have huge amounts of these
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:47.820]   heavy elements in them, and they tell us in much more detail, "Something really interesting
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.820]   happened somewhere."
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.580]   - Well, wait, I thought the really old ones we would not have.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.180]   So what does that mean if the old--
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.660]   - Ah, yes, important clarification.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:05.540]   So the stars that we are observing today, these old ones, they formed from the gas,
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.940]   and the question is, what enriched that gas?
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:16.220]   So it could have been just a first star dumping their elements into that gas all the way up
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   to iron.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.060]   - Right.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.180]   - And we have found some stars that we think are second-generation stars.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.300]   So they formed from gas enriched by just one first star.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.300]   That's super cool.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.300]   - Yeah.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:38.060]   - Then we find other old stars that have a much more complicated heavy element signature,
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:43.900]   and that means, okay, they're probably formed in a gas cloud that had a few things going
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:52.340]   on, such as maybe a first star, maybe another more normal supernova, and maybe some kind
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:58.500]   of special process like a neutron star merger that would make heavy elements.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:06.580]   And so they created a local chemical signature from which the next-generation star then formed,
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.700]   and that is what we're observing today.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:16.900]   So all these old stars basically carry the signature from all these progenitor events,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:23.500]   and it's our job then to unravel, okay, which processes and which events and how many may
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.220]   have occurred in the early universe that led to exactly that signature that we observe
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.900]   13 billion years later.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:36.060]   - Is it possible to figure out the number of generations that resulted in these stars?
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:42.260]   - Well, we think we can sort of say, okay, this was like second generation or third,
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:50.900]   because the amounts of heavy elements in the stars that we observe is so tiny.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.420]   One normal supernova explosion is actually already basically too much.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.060]   It would give us too much of it.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.100]   And the thing is, you can never take away things in the universe.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.100]   You can only add.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:08.100]   There's no cosmic vacuum cleaner going around sucking things away.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.260]   Black holes are probably the closest to that, but they would have taken the whole star.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.580]   - Yeah, they'd take the whole thing, not just a little bit of it.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.380]   - They wouldn't take stuff out of the gas, you know.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:26.340]   So we have maybe 10 stars or so now where we are saying they contain so little of these
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:33.340]   heavy elements that there must be second generation because how else would you have made them?
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.300]   And again, I want to stress that the elements that we observe in these stars were not made
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.060]   by the stars themselves that we observe.
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.780]   That's just a reflection of the gas cloud.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.180]   So we don't actually, I had to say that because I love stars.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.980]   At the end of the day, we don't really care for the stars that we're observing.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.460]   We care for the story that they're telling us about the early universe.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:59.340]   - So yeah, so the stars are kind of a small mirror into the early universe.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.980]   And so what are you detecting about those stars?
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.260]   Can you tell me about the process of archeology here?
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:09.940]   What kind of data can we possibly get to tell the story about these heavy elements on the
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.940]   stars?
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.900]   - Yeah, it depends really on what star you find.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.620]   There are many different chemical signatures.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:27.460]   We actually pair up these days our element signatures with also kinematic information,
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.020]   how the star moves about the galaxy.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.900]   That actually gives us clues as to where the star might have come from.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:41.580]   Because again, all these old stars are in the galaxy, but they are not off the galaxy.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.740]   That's a small but important distinction.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.220]   So they all came from somewhere else.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.660]   - So you can rewind back in time to kind of estimate where it came from.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.980]   - Yeah, so we can't really say, "Oh, it came from that dwarf galaxy."
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:57.340]   But interestingly enough, just a few days ago, I submitted a paper with three women
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.340]   undergrads.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.020]   It was so good to work together.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:09.020]   And we found a sample of stars that have very, very low abundances in strontium and barium,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.320]   so very heavy elements.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:17.300]   And I had a hunch for a while that these stars would probably be some of the oldest.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:23.600]   Because as I said, heavy elements give you extra information about special events.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:31.660]   And again, finding something that's really low means that must have happened either really
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:35.820]   early on or in a very special environment, right?
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.300]   Because we can only ever add.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.500]   So if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of the abundance, maybe just
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.640]   one event contributed that max.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:51.860]   So we looked at the kinematics, how are these stars moving, and they're all going the wrong
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.980]   way in the galaxy.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.180]   How is that possible?
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.140]   Well, it is possible because consider, now we come back to the proto-galaxy.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.780]   The proto-galaxy was like a beehive.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.940]   It just didn't really know what it was or what it wanted to become when it grew up.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.660]   And it was absorbing all these little galaxies to grow fast.
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:19.460]   Some galaxies, some absorbed galaxies were thrown in going the main way, and some came
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.980]   in the wrong way.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.420]   It happens.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:29.760]   But this could only happen early on when there wasn't left and right and up and down.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.400]   So stuff would come in from all ways.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.940]   So now, 13 billion years later, we're looking...
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.940]   They're still doing it.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.580]   Yeah, A, they're still doing it.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:43.460]   But B, we just looked for stars that have low strontium and barium abundances, and then
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:48.620]   we look at the kinematics, and lo and behold, they're all at hundreds of kilometers per
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.540]   second going the wrong way.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.380]   It's like, dude, you must have come in really early on from somewhere else.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.260]   So we call this retrograde motion.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:04.020]   That's a clear sign of accretion, so something that has come into the galaxy.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:10.540]   And because they are so fast, and it's really all of them, that must have happened early
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   on.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.900]   You can't throw a galaxy into the Mickey Ray right now the wrong way.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.380]   It eventually will turn around.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:21.460]   - Can you actually just, on a small tangent, speak to the three women undergrads, this
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.460]   little...
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:29.740]   It's pretty cool that you were able to use a hunch to find this really cool little star.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.540]   Yeah, what's the process like, especially with undergrads?
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.020]   I think that would be very interesting and inspiring to people.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:42.580]   - Yes, it was a wonderful little collaboration that actually emerged in the fall.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:49.220]   So I really like working with undergrads and grad students, postdocs, and I came up with
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:55.940]   a new concept for a class at MIT where I wanted to integrate the research process into the
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:05.180]   classroom because sometimes people find it really hard to call, email a professor, "Hey,
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.820]   I'm this and that person, and I'm interested in your research.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.540]   Could I possibly come?"
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:19.060]   And I wanted to streamline that and give, not just trial, how it would work to provide
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:25.140]   a sort of the safe confines of a classroom where you just sign up and do research in
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.820]   a very structured way.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:34.860]   And I developed it, it was a lot of work, a little bit more than I thought, to map up
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:40.980]   an entire research project basically from scratch in 10 worksheets so that they could
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.980]   do it, again, in a very structured and organized fashion.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.420]   - Oh, so you created this whole framework for them to do it?
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.100]   - Yes, the whole thing.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:54.180]   But the promise was, you come sign up for my class in teams of two.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.100]   You each get your own old star that has not been analyzed before.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:02.740]   I don't know what the solution is because in research, we don't look up the solution
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.740]   at the end of the book.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.900]   We do not know what we're going to find.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.860]   Our job is to do the work and then to interpret the numbers because our job as scientists
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.380]   is to find the story.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.860]   Anyone can crunch numbers, anyone.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:23.940]   It's kind of complicated sometimes, but it's doable, right?
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:28.620]   But coming up with a story, when you only have three puzzle pieces, what does the puzzle
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.020]   look like?
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:37.140]   You have to be a little bit bold, you need to have some experience, and you need to kind
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.900]   of see the universe in 3D.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.520]   You just need to kind of go for it.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.540]   And that's the beautiful thing, I really love that.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:48.260]   - And so this was a story of weird kinematics going the wrong way combined with this particular
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.700]   weird signature in terms of the heavy elements.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.700]   - And you have to come up with a story about that.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   - Yes, and so the story of that paper is now, usually I don't say I find the oldest stars.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.860]   When I talk to my research colleagues, I talk to them about we find the chemically most
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.260]   pristine stars because that's actually what we measure, the chemical abundance that tells
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:13.900]   us, okay, it must have been second or third or fifth generation of stars, right?
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.820]   But these low strontium stars that go in the wrong way, like they're getting paid for it,
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:25.580]   they must be the oldest stars that came into the galaxy because they formed before the
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:29.660]   galaxy was the Milky Way, right?
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.780]   And it's so cool, and it was so wonderful.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.020]   So this class, it went so well in the fall.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.060]   I had nine people sign up.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.440]   That's not unusual for a class, a specialty class at MIT, so small number.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:50.340]   It was eight women, and they were so into it that I said, "Okay, let's use this opportunity.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.540]   You're gonna do some extra work with me, and we're gonna publish this."
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.540]   - Try to publish.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.540]   - Yes.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.060]   - I also like that you're using the terminology of chemically more pristine.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.980]   When I'm talking to younger people, I'll just say that I'm more chemically pristine than
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.980]   them.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.360]   I like that description of age.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.580]   So there's this term of metal-poor stars.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.700]   So most of these old stars are going to be metal-poor.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.700]   - Yes, I search for the most metal-poor stars.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.700]   - And what does that, can we just define?
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.260]   - Yeah, what does that mean?
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.380]   I don't know who came up with this.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:27.620]   I would love to know, but the universe is a complicated place.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:34.660]   So many decades ago, someone clever came up with the idea to say, "Let's simplify things
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.660]   a little bit.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:46.260]   Let's call hydrogen X, helium Y, and all the other elements combined, metals, Z."
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.180]   When I give public talks, I always ask, "Is there a chemist in the audience?
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.900]   Let me just tell you, neon is a wonderful metal."
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.340]   And they're like, "Oh my God, what's she saying?"
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.680]   I'm an astronomer, I'm not a chemist, so I'll get away with it.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.540]   So if you just roll with it for a moment, all the elements except hydrogen and helium
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.660]   are called metals.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:13.040]   Now if we look again at the concept of chemical evolution, it means more and more of all the
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:18.220]   elements, everything higher than hydrogen and helium gets produced slowly but surely
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.800]   by different types of stars and events.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:27.700]   So that's a monotonously increasing function.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:33.140]   And so we look for the stars that have the least amounts of heavy elements in them, because
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:39.220]   that means we are going further and further back in this process, in that function, almost
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:43.540]   all the way to the very beginning, and that is the first stars, right?
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.180]   They started that process.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:53.780]   That's why I said it was such an important transition phase, because we call the post-Big
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.860]   Bang universe pristine, just hydrogen and helium, and after that the mess started.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:04.040]   As soon as you add elements to it, things kind of get a little out of hand.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:09.220]   That ends in this beautiful variety that we have everywhere these days.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.100]   Yeah, and you're looking at the very early days of the introduction of the variety.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:20.020]   Yes, exactly, when it was still a little bit more organizable.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:24.740]   But the variety of different types of metal-poor stars we have is stark.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.940]   Many different types of stars, many patterns we have sort of identified, but there are
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:34.180]   still crazy ones out there that we're still trying to kind of fit in.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.660]   - So what kind of stars have been discovered?
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:46.340]   So you've already a while ago helped discover the star HE 1327 2326, great name.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.340]   - Yes.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:51.700]   - And HE 1523 0901.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   What can you say about these stars and others that have been found?
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.700]   - I love them.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.460]   They're my baby stars.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.500]   - What do you call your baby stars?
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.940]   - Well, I'm probably the only one who can spit out these names without cheating.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.940]   - Are those nicknames?
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.940]   - Well, no, that's...
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.940]   - It's not allowed?
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.940]   Okay.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:15.300]   - Well, some colleagues at conferences have just called them Anna Star or Fribo Star,
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.820]   because they didn't want to learn the phone number.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.820]   You know, I get it.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.820]   - The phone number, yeah.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:25.500]   - And these numbers are actually based on older sets of coordinates for these stars.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.740]   So they, yes, the minus in the middle means that they're in the Southern Hemisphere.
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:33.860]   So negative is in the Southern Hemisphere, positive is in the Northern.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:37.340]   And then 13 and 15 means that sort of observable in the middle of the year.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.260]   - Okay, so it has to do with the observation and where it was observed.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.620]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:50.100]   But they have very different stars, both absolutely significant career defining actually for me,
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.020]   but really pushed the envelope in very different ways.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:46:00.020]   So HG 1327, the first one that you mentioned, that was the second, second generation star
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:02.060]   that we found.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.260]   And you know, usually people say like, oh, the first one is the big one and the rest
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.420]   is nobody cares.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.580]   But to us, it proved that yes, we can do it.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:19.660]   Because one, astronomers live in this sort of way of, you know, there are a lot of serendipitous
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:26.500]   discoveries and we, that's really great, but we need to show that we can do it again.
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   - Reliably.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.180]   - Because then we're onto something and it's not just some kind of weird quirk.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:35.700]   And there are a lot of quirks in the universe, but we want to know is that a real thing?
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.940]   Does that happen regularly?
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.820]   Is there something that we can learn?
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.900]   Is that a piece of the story?
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.140]   And so finding the second one that was even a little bit more extreme than the first one
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:51.660]   really showed, yes, our search techniques work, we can find these stars.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:59.500]   They provide an important part to the story in the sense that if we had more than two
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:05.900]   stars, and by now we have about 10-ish or so, what do they tell us about the nature
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.500]   of the very first stars?
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:15.060]   And what we found, again, working with the theorists, of course, who run these supernova
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:23.500]   models is that, so actually let me, before I get into this, these two stars had huge
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.900]   amounts of carbon relative to iron.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:34.260]   So we usually use iron as a reference element for what we call the metallicity, so the overall
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.220]   metal content, the overall amount of heavy elements in it.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.820]   So that's why it's called iron deficient.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:41.940]   That's right.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:47.100]   So these stars are incredibly iron deficient, which means they must be of the second generation
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:55.260]   because there was, and interestingly enough, there was this discrepancy.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:02.460]   A normal supernova, until then, we thought would get us so much iron, you know, and you
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.260]   would distribute that in the gas cloud and then you would form this little star that
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.860]   we're observing, but the iron abundance that we measured was actually much lower than that.
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.540]   And I already mentioned, you can't take things away.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:20.140]   That must mean these early massive POP3, we call them Population 3, the first stars, they
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.180]   must have exploded in a different way than we previously thought.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:28.420]   They can't output as much iron because they just can't.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.020]   Otherwise it wouldn't match our observations.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:40.080]   And so that's when we started to work with several theory groups on supernova yields.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.820]   So what comes out of...
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.660]   From the explosion of the supernova?
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.660]   That's cool.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:45.660]   Supernova yields.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.020]   And so this one was not yielding much iron.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:54.860]   Well, we needed to concoct a theoretical supernova that made less.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.500]   And it's actually surprisingly difficult because you can always add more in the universe, right?
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.140]   But you can't take stuff away.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:09.060]   So Japanese colleagues kind of came up with the idea of a fainter supernova that just
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:13.380]   doesn't have enough oomph when it explodes.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:17.100]   So somehow there's less iron coming out.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:22.120]   But at the same time, then these stars showed huge overabundances of carbon, a thousand
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.260]   times more carbon.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:30.620]   So how do you now get a thousand times more carbon out of these poor first supernovae?
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.460]   That was the theoretical challenge.
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:39.300]   And because we didn't have just one star, but two, that really spurred the field to
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.900]   think about what was the nature of the first stars?
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.160]   How did they explode?
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.460]   What are the implications?
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:53.100]   Because if they are not as luminous and bright and energetic, that has consequences for these
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:50:00.260]   early proto-galaxies in which they must have been located in terms of blowing the gas out,
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.540]   let's say, and disrupting the system.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:07.580]   So much higher chance for the earlier system to stay intact for longer, right?
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.460]   So there's a whole tale of consequences.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:16.900]   And this is what I mean with we need to find the story because you do one thing and it's
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.540]   like the dominoes, there are consequences everywhere and suddenly you have a different
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.540]   universe, right?
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:26.580]   So what could possibly be a good explanation for something that yields a lot of carbon
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.580]   and doesn't yield a lot of iron?
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:33.980]   Well, it's not so much an explanation, more like finding a mechanism for what happens
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:40.740]   in supernovae and the official term, what was sort of, as I said, cooked up in order
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.500]   to explain the observation.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.300]   And we have, by the way, found a whole bunch more of these stars, so that holds.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.060]   And it's called a fallback mechanism.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:54.780]   So actually during the supernova explosion, a massive black hole emerges.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:58.340]   And so some of the material falls back onto the black hole.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.140]   So here is a vacuum cleaner now plopped into the middle, right?
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.660]   - Like a temporary one that just cleans up some of the elements?
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.660]   - Well, sort of, right?
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.300]   Because if you think of the, we haven't talked about this yet, but if you know what a star
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:18.020]   looks like, a massive star looks like in its interior before it explodes, you have hydrogen
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:22.580]   and helium still on the outskirts, and then you have layers of heavy and heavy elements
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.580]   all the way up to iron.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:28.060]   So you have an iron core in the center.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:33.100]   And because you can't get any energy out of iron when you want to fuse to iron atoms anymore,
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.860]   that's when the supernova explodes, or occurs really.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:42.620]   It's actually an implosion first, and then you have a bounce of the sort of neutron star
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.460]   phase that occurs in the process.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.460]   And then it gets disrupted.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.460]   - That is so awesome.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:53.460]   - Yeah, it's like this giant basketball, and then, whoa, it all goes out.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.340]   - So implosion first, explosion after.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.700]   - And so in the process, right, if you make your black hole basically big enough, it will
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:05.500]   suck away some of the iron because that's the closest in terms of the layers.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:11.140]   You hold onto it, you don't let it escape, and carbon is much further out, you let it
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.140]   all go.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.140]   - Nice.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.140]   - And so--
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:17.860]   - So that explains why you can have a big oomph and not much iron yield.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:18.860]   - Yes, yes.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.700]   - So is this explained, the HE 1327?
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:22.700]   - Correct.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.380]   - And others like it?
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.380]   - Yes.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.980]   So there's, it's well established now that the lower the iron abundance of the stars
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.420]   are, the higher the carbon sort of gets.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:40.860]   And carbon is such an interesting element in that regard.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:47.420]   If we come back to the formation of the first LOMAS stars, right, so we had the hotter gas,
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.140]   just hydrogen and helium, that made the first stars.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:54.980]   There were 100 solar masses or so because the gas couldn't cool enough, so they were
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.820]   big and puffy.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:03.940]   Carbon then, coming from the first stars, probably led to enough cooling in these gas
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:09.220]   clouds that enabled the formation of the first LOMAS stars.
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:13.540]   So think about what happened if there wouldn't have been any carbon, or the properties of
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.580]   the carbon atom would be different.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:20.580]   It would not have cooled the gas in such significant ways, perhaps.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.620]   There wouldn't be any LOMAS stars.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.780]   We wouldn't be here today, right?
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.020]   And we're carbon-based, and so I think carbon is really the most important element in the
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:35.420]   universe for a variety of reasons, because it has enabled this whole evolution that we're
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:40.180]   now observing and literally seeing in the sky, and it's really fascinating.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.780]   - So combined with the fact that you have the ion deficient, so all of that is probably
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.420]   important to creating humans.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:52.380]   - Yeah, yeah, we need all the elements, but if you don't have stars, like the sun, small
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:57.380]   stars that can actually host planets, that have long lifetimes, you need long, long lifetimes
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.340]   if you want to have a stable planet and develop humans.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:04.380]   - So carbon is kind of important in many ways.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.180]   - Yes, yes.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:12.260]   - This is perhaps an interesting tangent, if I could just mention that you interviewed
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:20.020]   a military dressel house, Carbon Queen, the remarkable life of the nanoscience pioneer.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:25.940]   Is there something you could say about the magic of Carbon and the magic of Millie?
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.700]   - Well Millie was certainly magic.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.340]   She was a professor at MIT for many decades.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.900]   I met her a number of times.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:40.180]   Her photograph, actually a young and an older Millie is still on the wall every time I step
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.540]   out of the elevator in one of the buildings I see it.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:54.460]   She pioneered all sorts of carbon nanowork, so she was a material scientist, very far
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.140]   removed from what I do on a daily basis.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.540]   But yes, carbon has amazing properties when you study it and again, that's indeed another
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:12.620]   aspect of why carbon is so fascinating, not just in the cosmos but also for us, making
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:17.820]   us, creating us in the way that we can use it.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.820]   It's wonderful.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.740]   - Do you sometimes think about this chemical evolution in this big philosophical way that
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:29.900]   we're the results of that chemical evolution, like we're made of this stuff, we're made
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.900]   of carbon?
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.900]   - Yes, we're made of star stuff.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:32.900]   - Yeah, and it came-- - Cross-check and go right.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:42.100]   - I mean it's almost like a cliche statement but it's also a materials, a chemical, a physics
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:47.620]   statement that we came from hydrogen and helium and that somehow this formation has created
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:52.420]   this interesting complexity of soup that made us.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.860]   What are we supposed to make of that?
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.300]   Like what, did we just get really lucky?
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.300]   Why did we get all this cool stuff?
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.620]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.140]   - I don't think it's a question that has an answer, I keep just asking why.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:12.780]   But it's just this incredible mystery, so much cool stuff had to happen, so much, sorry,
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.740]   hot stuff had to happen to create us.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:20.940]   - And so much could have gone wrong and there would have been another outcome and it's actually
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:24.260]   amazing how many things kind of fell in place.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:29.180]   I mean maybe that's all sort of self-deterministic in some ways, right?
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:33.060]   We are who we are because that was the path.
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.940]   Maybe we would have ended up being robots, I don't know.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:44.060]   But it's certainly wonderful to, you know, as scientists for us to help contribute unraveling
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.420]   our cosmic history, right?
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:53.860]   I always say the biological evolution on Earth was absolutely facilitated by the chemical
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.340]   evolution of the universe, right?
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.820]   And one doesn't go without the other.
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.180]   - And that evolution-- - From a human perspective.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:03.540]   - That evolution seems to be creating more and more complexity.
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:11.180]   The kind of interesting clumping of cool stuff seems to be accelerating and increasing.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:16.500]   It's hard not to see as humans that there's some kind of purpose to it, like a momentum
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.380]   towards complexity and beauty, you know?
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.980]   - Well beauty's in the eye of the beholder.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.360]   But yes, everything gets more complicated.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.420]   - But there's also a beauty to the chemically pristine universe in the early days.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.460]   - There certainly is, yes.
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:35.860]   I love the desert with its nothingness.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.340]   It has so much aesthetics and appeal.
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.780]   We came from nothing, we'll return to nothing.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:44.940]   So what about HE 1523?
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:45.940]   What's exciting?
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.140]   A red giant star.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.460]   - Yes.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.060]   - That's another one of your babies.
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.060]   - Yes.
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.540]   - 13.2 billion years old.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:00.020]   - Yeah, so that one isn't quite as iron deficient as the other one.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:06.260]   So probably not a second generation star, but easily second, third, fourth, fifth or
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.260]   so.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:12.700]   So you can't really pin it down, but it's also not super important for us.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:19.420]   What is important is that that star has a very different chemical composition in a sense
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.760]   that yes, we have all the elements up to iron there.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:31.900]   They have sort of normal ratios, which means kind of the same as most other old stars and
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:39.180]   not too different from the Sun or at least different in quantifiable ways.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.860]   But it has this huge overload of very heavy elements.
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:48.180]   And what was so nice about that star in particular was that I could measure the thorium and the
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:50.900]   uranium abundance.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:58.900]   And again, that was the second of its kind, but the uranium abundance could be more well
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:58:59.900]   determined.
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.620]   So we had a better grasp on that.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:05.660]   Now why are thorium and uranium interesting?
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.060]   They are radioactive elements.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.400]   They decay.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:20.160]   Thorium has a half-life of 14 billion years, I believe, and uranium of 4.7, which to folks
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.580]   on us on Earth is a really long time, but those kind of timelines are really good when
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:29.660]   you want to explore the early universe.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:34.940]   So there are two questions now that kind of come to mind.
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:40.060]   Where do these elements come from and what do they tell us?
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:46.740]   And as we know, these heavy elements are made in a specific process.
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:52.760]   It's a neutron capture process, usually referred to as the R process for rapid neutron capture
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.140]   process.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.380]   We talked about seed nuclei before, right?
[00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:00.480]   So we still don't exactly know where this process can occur.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.380]   So you have, let's say, a lone iron atom somewhere, and it is in an environment where you have
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:12.340]   a strong neutron flux, which means there must be lots of neutrons around.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:17.620]   And again, when we talk about the site, we can surmise and ponder where that might be
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.020]   the case.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.300]   But you have this iron atom and you bombard it with neutrons and you do it incredibly
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.300]   fast.
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.340]   Now what happens in the process?
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:32.620]   That iron atom, you collect lots of neutrons, it becomes really big and unstable.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:39.580]   So it's a heavy neutron-rich nucleus that wants to decay because it's not stable, it's
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.620]   way too big.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:48.260]   And so let's say you add only one neutron to it, that would already make it unstable.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:53.940]   So it has a characteristic decay time that's called the beta decay timescale, so it will
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.540]   decay to a stable nucleus.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:00.380]   So the neutron will convert to a proton and that makes it stable.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:05.860]   If you now bombard lots and lots and lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus within
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:12.640]   that timescale of the beta decay, that's how you get to this huge, fat, neutron-rich nucleus
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.880]   that then wants to decay, right?
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.260]   So the rapid processes, you have your seed nuclei, they get bombarded, you create these
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:26.500]   really heavy neutron-rich nuclei, they're heavier than uranium even, the neutron flux
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.460]   stops and then all these heavy nuclei, they decay.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:37.540]   And they make all these stable isotopes that we know of, all the way up to thorium and
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.540]   uranium.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:43.020]   So that rapid nuclei decay is what creates all the funnels.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.020]   Correct.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:48.260]   And the whole thing is done within two seconds.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:55.820]   So just to add to the rapid here, literally the snapping on my hand, it's all there.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:03.020]   In my talks, I often have this nice simulation that illustrates this creation of these heavy
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:09.020]   nuclei, and I always say, "This is the only simulation you will ever see that's slower
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.020]   than real time."
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:16.020]   Because in astronomy, we show, "Oh, this is how a galaxy forms, 13 billion years in
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:19.260]   30 seconds," really short, right?
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.740]   This is the opposite.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.080]   Me showing you this, the elements are long made.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.980]   So where and when does this happen, does this process happen?
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.180]   So you need the strong neutron flux.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.180]   That's the clumping of the neutrons.
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.980]   Yes, that's right.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.460]   And so there are not that many options, right?
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:40.020]   So where do you find lots of neutrons in the universe?
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.660]   Well, it's neutron stars, right?
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:48.020]   Neutron stars form in the making of supernovae, of the explosions.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:52.780]   Okay, so maybe some of this heavy material gets sort of made in the making of the supernova
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.180]   explosion and then gets expelled.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:03.260]   Or you have neutron stars, so if the neutron star, I mean, usually that's the leftover
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.260]   of the supernova.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:10.340]   If you have two from a binary pair, so stars usually actually show up in pairs, and so
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:17.980]   it's not too unusual to create a pair of neutron stars that will still orbit each other after
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.460]   both of their progenitor stars have exploded.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.740]   And those two neutron stars will orbit each other diligently.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:32.500]   But as we know now, thanks to LIGO, the Gravitational Wave Observatory, I mean, we know already
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:38.740]   that before but now it's been measured by LIGO, is that these two neutron stars, they
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:44.100]   will orbit each other for like forever, but in the process they will lose energy.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:49.980]   So that orbit is what we call the orbit decays, and eventually the two neutron stars will
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:58.260]   merge and that results in an explosive event that has roughly the energy of a supernova,
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.140]   but the process is completely different.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:06.900]   And the cool thing is when these two neutron stars collide, they produce a gravitational
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.580]   wave signature because neutron stars are super dense objects.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.660]   They're like giant atomic nucleuses.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:19.280]   So there's a lot of interesting physics happening already, and so if you basically form a super
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:26.620]   neutron star by smashing two into each other, more interesting physics happens, and that
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:36.140]   means that there's this ripple sent out into the space-time continuum basically, you know,
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:41.300]   what do people say, the ripples of space-time, you know, it's like you drop a rock into water,
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.300]   right?
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.740]   You see the waves coming, so that's exactly what happens when two neutron stars merge,
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.900]   and this is neutrons galore, right?
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:56.900]   It's really violent to smash two neutron stars that are so dense already into each other.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:05.460]   And in 2017, one of these events occurred, and the LIGO and Virgo Gravitational Wave
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.820]   Observatories, they detected that, and then the astronomers pointed their telescopes in
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:16.320]   that direction, and they indeed observed what we call the electromagnetic counterpart.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:24.020]   So there was something seen in the sky that faded over the course of two weeks, and that
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:32.200]   light curve, that light was exactly what you get when you create all these heavy neutron-rich
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.620]   nuclei in the R process, and then the neutron flux stops, and then it takes about two or
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:43.220]   three weeks for most of them, of these nuclei, to decay to stability.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:51.140]   So we saw, the astronomers saw in this electromagnetic counterpart, the nucleosynthesis of heavy
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:55.220]   elements occurring, and that's just awesome.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.220]   - That's amazing.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.220]   - So awesome.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.180]   - So that's electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational waves that were detected
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:11.340]   with two neutron stars colliding aggressively, violently, to create a super neutron star,
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.940]   and that's where you get all the neutrons and neutron flux somehow, and then the whole
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.540]   shebang that happens in two seconds and creates a bunch of--
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:24.260]   - So that confirmed that one of the sites, for sure, is, for the R process to occur,
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.460]   is neutron star mergers.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:32.060]   Interestingly enough, I have to mention this here, a year prior, in 2016, my former grad
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:40.220]   student Alex G. and I, we discovered a small dwarf galaxy that is currently orbiting the
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:48.060]   Milky Way, it's called Reticulum 2, that was full of ancient iron-deficient stars that
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:54.700]   also had a strong signature of these heavy elements, exactly like He 1523.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.260]   We weren't looking for that.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:01.180]   I actually wanted to prove that they had really low levels of heavy elements, because that's
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:08.620]   what we had seen in all the other dwarf galaxies, and I was dead set on showing that that is
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:13.540]   yet the case again, and that that is a typical signature of early star formation.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:18.100]   We already talked about low strontium and barium abundances and the oldest stars, right?
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.520]   This is what we had seen anecdotally in the ancient dwarf galaxies that are surrounding
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520]   us.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.900]   - That's an ancient dwarf galaxy, that dwarf galaxy has a bunch of ancient stars in it.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.020]   - Yes, yes.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:35.580]   And so now we find Reticulum 2, and it has these, the stars show the signature of the
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:42.740]   rapid neutron capture process, the R process, and we are like, okay, these stars are located
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.780]   in a dwarf galaxy right now, we have environmental information, they are not lost in the galaxy
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.700]   where we don't know where they actually came from.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:55.080]   No, we know these stars were formed in that galaxy because they're still in it.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.400]   And that we already deduced from that, that it must have been a neutron star merger that
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:04.920]   went off in Reticulum 2 at early times, that polluted the gas from which all our little
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920]   stars formed.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.920]   - Can you speak to what a dwarf galaxy is?
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.920]   Can you speak to what this Reticulum 2 dwarf galaxy is that is orbiting the Milky Way galaxy?
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.120]   It's going to be eaten by it, presumably?
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.480]   - It totally is going to be eaten.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.060]   I can't tell you exactly when.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:25.860]   Yeah, the Milky Way remains surrounded by dozens of small dwarf galaxies.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.620]   They're collections of stars.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:34.020]   Some of them, we call them ultra-faint dwarf galaxies because they now only contain, I
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.940]   don't know, a few thousand stars.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:37.940]   Very very faint.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.940]   - They're still detectable?
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:45.060]   - Yes, because they're fairly close, and we detect actual individual stars in them.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.300]   So I've observed some of the fainter stars.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:52.460]   You possibly observe with current telescopes in these dwarf galaxies because I was like,
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:57.980]   I need to know what the chemical composition is because there are leftovers from the early
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:58.980]   universe.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.920]   They did not get eaten.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.080]   So they're still in their native surroundings.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.720]   It's like getting the lions in the wild, right?
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:13.680]   I got to study those and compare to the counterparts that got eaten and are now in the Milky Way.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.680]   And so I...
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.000]   - But presumably most of those stars, not all of those stars in that dwarf galaxy are
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   really ancient.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.120]   - They're all really ancient because actually, as it turns out, if you have a small galaxy,
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.360]   there was a process early on in the universe called reionization that kind of heated up
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.100]   everything.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:40.240]   And together with some supernova explosions in an early shallow, you know, bound system,
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.500]   all these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:48.200]   It was sort of blown out or it simply evaporated or both, probably both.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:53.800]   And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:10:01.320]   So it's the best for us stellar archaeologists that you could hope for because it's a whole
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.160]   bunch of stars still sitting there.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:07.840]   It's not just one, it's a whole bunch of them still sitting there ever since and nothing
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.120]   has literally nothing has happened to them.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.820]   They've just been waiting there for us.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:17.840]   - So from the stellar archaeology perspective, what is juicier and more interesting, the
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.680]   old stars in the outskirts that have been eaten or the outskirts of Milky Way or the
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.840]   stars in the dwarf galaxies?
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.960]   What's of all the things you love about the world?
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.600]   You said you love stars, so which do you love more of your church?
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   - That's a hard one.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.280]   I mean, I love them all, of course.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.800]   They serve different purposes.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.800]   The stars in the Milky Way, I can get much, much, much better data for them because they're
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.840]   brighter, they're closer, so they're brighter.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.880]   And that tickles my fancy.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.000]   - And they have interesting kinematics, presumably.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.640]   - Yes, and we can get that.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:02.760]   And so HT 1523, for example, that one is really bright, it's a red giant, so it's intrinsically
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.960]   bright and it's fairly close.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:10.200]   And so the data I got for that was insanely good and that yielded this uranium detection
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.400]   and thorium detection.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.560]   I can never get that kind of data for dwarf galaxies, though.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.600]   So that's a big trade-off.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.880]   But the environmental information that we get along with the basic information about
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:28.520]   these stars in each dwarf galaxy is really, really valuable in establishing, for example,
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.720]   the site information, right?
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.560]   Because the galaxy is still there, so nothing crazy could have happened.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:41.720]   So actually to close that loop, probably some heavy elements come out of supernovae here
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.960]   and there, but somehow my theory colleagues tell me that a normal supernova just doesn't
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.840]   have enough oomph to really get an R process going and doing it all.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.480]   - So you need these orbiting supernovae.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.200]   - We need probably the neutron star mergers or we need a special kind of supernova that's
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.480]   maybe extremely massive or heavily rotating or does something else funny, right, to really
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.040]   kind of get that particular process going.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.280]   But the normal supernovae don't do it, right?
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.600]   So only a little bit comes out.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.320]   But you could come along and say, "Anna, why don't you just take 100 supernovae together
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.580]   to build up the yield?"
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:21.120]   But then I come along and say, "Look, this dwarf galaxy is still intact today.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.520]   If you would have plugged in 100 supernovae into this little system early on, it would
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.780]   have blown apart.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:30.720]   It would have blown apart past 5 supernovae or 10."
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.920]   So that's a really important constraint that we have that these systems are still alive,
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920]   right?
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.840]   So it helps us to pin down where certain processes could have possibly happened.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.040]   And so it's just a different type of information that we get.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.240]   - It'd be amazing if we could talk about the observational aspect of this, the tools of
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.580]   observation.
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:57.080]   So what telescopes have you used, do you use, and what does the data look like?
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.680]   And I think I've read a few interesting stories about the actual process of day-to-day observation,
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.520]   a bunch of probably late nights.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.920]   - Well, yeah, astronomers are doing it all night long, so we have lots of late nights.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.240]   - Can you explain the all-night-long aspect of it?
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.240]   - Well, let me start by saying I mostly these days use the Magellan telescopes in Chile.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.800]   They are 6.5 meter telescope, which means the mirror diameter is 6.5 meter.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.480]   It's not the largest that is out there, but it's among the largest.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:39.160]   And I use a spectrograph because I'm a spectroscopist, I don't take pictures.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:45.820]   And that particular spectrograph at that telescope is actually unusually efficient.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.960]   So it kind of makes up for the fact that the mirror isn't as large in, let's say, the 8
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.840]   meter telescopes from the Europeans or so.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.560]   So I'm very happy with that.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.560]   - Efficiency meaning?
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:02.920]   - So many photons get collected sort of per time unit because that's always the limiting
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.520]   factor.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:13.000]   Prior to the pandemic, we would travel to Chile to do our observations.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Those telescopes are the, that's the last observatory where people were sort of supposed
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.840]   to travel there and take their own observations.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.400]   Most other observatories basically have staff there by now who take the observations for
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400]   you.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:32.320]   - So there's the directly, the scientists are specifying where to point the telescope
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   and sitting there and collecting the data, make sure the data is collected well, the
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.480]   cleaning of the data, the offloading of the data, all that kind of stuff.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.320]   - Yeah, so it's mostly done for them.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:49.920]   Obviously that's super convenient, but it also takes away a central part of what the
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.680]   work of an astronomer is, which is data collection.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.560]   We don't have an experiment in the basement where we can go day and night or whenever
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.160]   we please and ask a certain question of the apparatus, right?
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.880]   Let's turn this knob and see what happens.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.480]   Let's turn that knob and see what happens.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:15.120]   No, you know, we only have one experiment, which is the universe and what we see is what
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.200]   we get.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.540]   And I think it's so important to take an active role in that.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.760]   So I really love going to the observatory.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:33.160]   I've taken many students there over the years to teach them and to just show them what it
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:39.920]   means to be an astronomer because you go to these remote mountaintops and it's such a
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:46.440]   magical environment and you wait there for the sun to go down and then you get ready
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:53.120]   and you look outside and it's such a serene environment.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.400]   It's a little bit out of this world.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.240]   You're sitting there, so the sun goes down, it's evening, late evening, and what does
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240]   it look like?
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.840]   What are some of the most magical experiences of that process?
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.240]   Well, you know, when you're on top of a mountain, you know, climbers I guess get to see that
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:14.720]   probably, otherwise.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:22.920]   It's very calm and the colors are so beautiful and I always become much calmer when I'm there.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:28.920]   I'm just A, because I'm just there for one purpose only, that's data collection.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:34.680]   I can say no to my emails, I can say no to everything else because I'm observing.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:41.000]   So there's literally less distractions because, you know, you're just there to do one thing.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.240]   And also the emails somehow seem less significant.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:52.240]   It's just, you can afford to focus on this one thing and it just kind of does something
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.240]   to you.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.880]   It's a little hard to describe, but, you know, if you then fast forward, maybe I can speak
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.560]   a little bit about that.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.720]   I have done a lot of astrophotography there as well, so, and observing faint dwarf galaxy
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.840]   stars, you know, these are like 45 minutes, 55 minute exposures, so you actually have
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.840]   a lot of time.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:18.800]   And I would run outside and just lay on the ground under the Southern Milky Way, beautiful,
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.240]   right up, you know, there.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:27.960]   And I would just lay there like the snow angel, you know, and just stare up there and just
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:34.880]   kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through my brain and just like, I'm one of it, right?
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.980]   We talked about this in the beginning.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:42.560]   This is when I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it, I belong here, rather
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.120]   than feeling kind of small.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.440]   Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things and lots of small things make one big
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.440]   whole, right?
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.760]   Yeah, we're part of that big whole.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.160]   So that's looking at the inner spirals of the Milky Way galaxy.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:01.160]   And just, you know, this dark sky with the bright stars.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:07.960]   And I have described this in my book years ago, if the Milky Way is all bright above
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:12.440]   you, you don't need a moon or anything, you can walk in the starlight and you will find
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.440]   your way.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:18.760]   There are no trees there for safety reasons, but you wouldn't even run into a tree, right?
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.440]   I mean, you can see, you can almost see the shadow, you know, from the starlight because
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.880]   it's such a dark sight and the stars are so bright.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.480]   And these are kind of moments that kind of change you a little bit.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.320]   And you see the unity of it all.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:42.040]   And it's just you and nature and, you know, with modern civilization and all of that,
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.120]   I think we often try a little bit too hard to be removed from nature, you know, to be
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.460]   independent of it and figuring it all out.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:54.540]   But at the end of the day, we're just a part of it.
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:00.860]   And that really helps me to remember that, you know, we're one in the same.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.980]   Well, that fills me with hope that, because I tend to think of us humans as in the very
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.300]   early days of whatever the heck we are.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:13.780]   And so that makes me think thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:19.780]   from now, that we'll be reaching, whatever we become, we'll be traveling out there to
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.940]   explore more and more and more.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:26.100]   So what you're doing is the early days of exploration with the tools we have.
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:30.820]   Yes, the early seafarers looking at the sky for navigation.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:35.100]   Coming up with different theories of what's on the other side, that the earth, starting
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:38.140]   to gain an intuition that the earth may be round.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:43.020]   And then we might be able to navigate all the way around to get to the financial benefits
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:48.040]   of getting spices from India, whatever the reason, whatever the grant funding process
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:53.900]   is all about, but ultimately actually results in a deep understanding of the mystery that's
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.060]   all around us.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:58.740]   And I mean, it's just to travel out there.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:07.380]   I mean, to me, the discovery of life in the solar system, I really hope to see that in
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.380]   my lifetime.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:15.980]   Some kind of life, bacteria, something, maybe dead, because that means there's life everywhere.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:22.380]   And that's just the kind of stuff that might be out there.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:27.380]   All the different environmental conditions, chemically speaking, that are out there.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:33.060]   It just seems like when you look at earth, life finds a way to survive, to thrive in
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.740]   whatever conditions.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:41.900]   And so maybe that process just kind of humbles you and is super exciting to know that there
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:44.700]   is life out there of different forms.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:49.260]   Of course, that raises the question of what is life, even?
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:56.100]   We tend to have a very human-centric perspective of what is a living organism and what is intelligence
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.740]   and all this kinds of stuff.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:02.100]   And all the work in artificial intelligence now is starting to challenge our ideas of
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.820]   what makes human beings special.
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:08.440]   I think we're doing that through all kinds of ways, and I think you're working some part
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.340]   doing that as well.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:16.620]   The unity you feel is realizing we're part of this big mechanism of nature, whatever
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:22.220]   that is, that's creating all kinds of cool stuff from the humble, pristine origins to
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.220]   today.
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:30.860]   So if you could just kind of linger on the process of the data, what does the data look
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.020]   like?
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:40.100]   And how does the raw data lead to a discovery of an ancient star?
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:45.260]   Well as a spectroscopist, we have to, I guess, talk for a brief moment about what a spectrum
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:49.580]   is.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.460]   Everyone I hope has seen a rainbow in the sky.
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:57.020]   That is basically what we're doing.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:02.340]   We don't send the starlight through a raindrop that then gets bounced around and splits up
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:06.380]   the light into the rainbow colors.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:09.740]   We do it with a spectrograph, so basically a prism.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:15.980]   So we send the starlight through a prism of sorts and that splits it up, and then we record
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.340]   exactly that.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:23.500]   So it's a little 2D picture actually of a spectrum.
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:28.700]   Now it's not going to look colorful, just black and white.
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:34.220]   Different colors have of course different energies, that's what we record.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:40.100]   More specifically, we record it as wavelengths, so wavelengths and frequency and energies
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:44.300]   all the same at the end of the day.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:52.220]   We process that little image in a sense that we do a crosscut and then sum up a few columns
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:55.700]   so that we get all the data that we recorded.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:23:02.880]   And what we see is a, it's a bit funny to describe just with words, but a wiggly line
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.420]   with lots of dips.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:09.740]   So the 2D processed spectrum, we call it continuum, so it's just a flat line basically and then
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:10.740]   there are dips.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.200]   So the interesting things are the dips.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.620]   If you think back of the rainbow, what we actually see in our stars is not just a rainbow,
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:24.640]   but it would be a rainbow with lots of black lines in it, which means certain little pieces
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:29.260]   of color have been eaten away by a certain amount.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:34.340]   So we can no longer see it as well or not at all.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.660]   Why is that happening?
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:39.680]   So if we come back to our stars, what we're observing, we're observing the stellar surface.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:46.660]   We can actually never peer with our telescopes inside, we only ever can go after the surface.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:55.660]   And the surface contains, or the surface layer contains different kinds of elements.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:24:02.100]   Every one of those types of atoms, so elements are just different types of atoms, they absorb
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:08.120]   different photons that are coming from the hot core where the fusion is occurring.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:14.180]   And so that means that if you were the observer, you know, with a spectrograph or without,
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:20.300]   you will see the starlight, but certain frequencies, certain energies of that light will have been
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:23.880]   absorbed by all the different atoms in the gas.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.220]   So you see less of them.
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:27.300]   And so those are the dips.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:37.120]   And the strength of the dips tell us which element was it and how much of that element
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.380]   was or is in the star.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.700]   So we have many, many, many dips.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:47.940]   The solar spectrum for reference, all the dips are overlapping because the abundance
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.860]   of all the elements is so high.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:53.140]   It's actually a very complicated spectrum.
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:57.260]   My spectra really look like a straight line and then there's a dip here and then you have
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.020]   the straight line again, there's a dip there.
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.260]   The Sun doesn't have straight lines.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:05.020]   I mean, it's just all absorbed in some form or another.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:10.900]   But the old stars have so little of all the elements that there are only occasionally
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:15.900]   these dips that then indicate, okay, that one at that wavelength was iron and here we
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:21.180]   have carbon and there's magnesium and sodium and there's a little strontium line here.
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:29.780]   So we have a much easier way to map out this barcode that the spectrum pretty much is at
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:36.060]   the end of the day and to then measure the strength of these, we call it absorption lines,
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:41.100]   to then calculate with existing codes that mimic the physics of the stellar atmospheres,
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:48.580]   like how much was absorbed, what kind of elements were present in the stellar atmosphere.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:53.020]   And so this is how we get to our abundance measurements and then all together that gives
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:59.020]   us the chemical composition and that particular signature in that star.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:06.220]   - If you ever look at like the raw spectrograph and the absorption line and are able to see
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:14.860]   into it some interesting non-standard outlier kind of patterns or does this have to do heavy
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:18.120]   amount of processing?
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:23.960]   - We actually process, it's fairly straightforward to do our processing.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.420]   We do it at the telescope.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:31.820]   So I often take a shorter exposure first, let's say 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:37.260]   So mostly when I do discovery work, we just take a quick look spectrum, then we process
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.920]   it while we observe the next star.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.700]   Then we take a quick look, we have what I call the summary plot.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:50.740]   It's a collection of little areas in the spectrum that have the key positions, the positions
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.500]   of the key elements in it.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.140]   And it's kind of like reading the tea leaves.
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:00.380]   I have stared at so many spectra, I just need to know, I just need to see our summary plot
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.300]   and I can tell you exactly what the numbers are going to be.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.900]   - And also to tell if it's going to be promising to look at further?
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:07.900]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:08.900]   And so that's it.
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.540]   Thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.780]   Are you worth my time or not?
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:18.380]   In most cases it's not, or it's good enough, we can do a basic analysis, maybe publish
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:23.740]   this as part of a larger sample just so we output that we have observed the star and
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:28.820]   their basic nature, that's an important part to publish as well.
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:30.980]   And yeah, I had a run.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.460]   So now we do remote observing.
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:40.140]   I do all of this now from my home, from my living room all night long.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:46.660]   And I often work with colleagues, so we do it over Zoom and we process the data, we look
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.580]   at it, same thing still.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:54.300]   And we just found a star that had a very low iron abundance.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:58.740]   And then we decided, okay, that looks interesting, we're just going to keep exposing.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:03.100]   So we took more data on it on the spot and we're writing up the paper right now.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.180]   - How do you know where to point the telescope?
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.180]   - It's not random.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:11.140]   There's a lot of work that goes into that.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:19.740]   I began my career by trying to answer that question as in like doing the search process.
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:25.820]   That's why I called my book that I've written some time ago, "Searching for the Oldest Stars"
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:29.780]   because searching is one thing, it's very time consuming.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.060]   And then on top of that, not everyone finds, right?
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:38.980]   And I often don't find, but I keep searching because techniques have established that yes,
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:44.620]   we can do it if we're just patient enough and keep going because it's a numbers game.
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:47.420]   And that's often the case in science.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:54.900]   And that's something that not enough is talked about, how tedious it is and how long it takes
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:59.860]   to get to that one discovery, right?
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:01.260]   That moves the field further.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:06.620]   - And how difficult it is to believe that there's a thing to be discovered.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:08.820]   - Yes, yes.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:15.540]   We have the saying, I learned this I think from my supervisor, one star is a discovery,
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:20.420]   two is a sample and three is a population.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:25.300]   So as soon as you found three of roughly the same kind, you're done.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.620]   But you need to get there.
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:29.580]   - Yeah, probably the first is the hardest, right?
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:30.580]   - Yes.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:33.860]   - It kind of remains really hard.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:38.540]   But the thing is then at past three, many of us are like, okay, we solved that problem.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:42.020]   We've done it three times, we can do it.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:43.020]   That's a thing, right?
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:47.820]   That's a population, three iron deficient stars, let's say, right?
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:48.940]   That's one puzzle piece.
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.660]   Now we can move on to the next thing.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:53.340]   - That's an indicator that there's many more of them potentially.
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:54.500]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:30:01.700]   So to cut a long story short about the searching, we started early on with what's called low
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:04.180]   resolution spectroscopy of many stars.
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:12.100]   So for example, my thesis work almost 20 years ago was piggybacking off a quasar survey that
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:18.300]   had collected, so quasars are basically giant supermassive black holes that are really far
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.300]   away.
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.820]   So you only see one big bright light point.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:25.740]   So it looks like a star, but it's actually just a giant supermassive black hole that
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:29.460]   outshines its own galaxy.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:36.180]   And people had been trying to study those and they had taken little spectra of all things
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:41.300]   in the sky and it turns out, oh, you can fish out the actual stars from that and look for
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:50.060]   certain signatures that might indicate low metallicity stars, so stars with low abundances.
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:55.860]   And so it was painstaking work to then take medium resolution spectroscopy to get a little
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:31:00.260]   bit more information and to use approximations and to kind of get candidates that we can
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:05.460]   then eventually take to the big glass like Magellan to get a high resolution spectrum.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:10.700]   So we really see the dips of all the individual elements that then give us the final answer,
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:13.620]   is it yay or nay?
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:22.420]   These days with another grad student I developed a new technique to use images actually of
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:26.700]   all the stars in the sky taken with very narrow filters.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:31.680]   So it's like you're wearing very specific glasses that only let so much light through.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:38.100]   And so we can do similar things through having several narrow band filters, what we call
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:45.180]   it, to fish out things that have no absorption over here, so just the straight line and then
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:49.620]   a little dip here, so a little something there.
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:53.180]   And that has proven fairly successful in recent years.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:57.740]   - So looking at the entire, looking at broader regions of space.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:01.100]   - That's right, because these stars are a little bit like the needle in the haystack,
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:02.100]   right?
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:07.420]   There are not that many left over and certainly the galaxy has made plenty of stars in between.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:12.660]   We need to comb through all of those to get to the goods.
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:16.820]   So we always start with millions and then work our way down and in the end we have like
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:17.820]   three good candidates.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:22.180]   - I wonder how those ancient stars feel that they were noticed.
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.380]   They probably know that nobody pays attention.
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.700]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.380]   - We're all special, right?
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.380]   So are the stars.
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:33.420]   - It's good, it's inspiring, even if you're the outcast.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.740]   In your pristine nature you still might nevertheless be noticed.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:42.420]   I'm hoping the same about humans if somebody's observing us.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.580]   Is there something else you could say that's about the challenges of this kind of high
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:50.460]   precision measurement that you're doing?
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:58.140]   So this kind of collection of data looking, trying to kind of pull out the signal from
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.860]   the noise out there.
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.860]   - Well that's literally what we're doing in multiple ways actually.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:09.580]   We're trying to find the needle in the haystack and then we find something and then it turns
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:14.740]   out it's just a little bit too faint to actually get the kind of data quality on it that we
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:21.060]   would like or that would be warranted given the potential of the star, right?
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.420]   It's like, "Ugh!"
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:24.420]   - So there's always noise.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:29.180]   There's always a little bit of noise and you have to try to say like, "How special is this
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:32.100]   when you're looking at the absorption line?"
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:37.980]   So the most iron-poor stars, their iron lines are so tiny that they're literally almost
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:38.980]   in the noise.
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:45.300]   So you need incredibly good data to make detections.
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:50.820]   And the funny thing is we're looking for the nothingness of, let's say, the iron lines,
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:54.780]   but then we don't want nothing because if there's nothing in the spectrum we can't measure
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:55.780]   anything.
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:57.540]   We can only get an upper limit.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.220]   But we'd really like a measurement.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:03.200]   So we are looking for the last little bit that you could possibly detect.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.220]   And that's a strong function of the brightness of the star because the telescopes have the
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.460]   size that they do.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.820]   That's not going to change for a while.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:15.000]   Hopefully eventually it will, but it's going to be at least 10 years out.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.980]   And so yes, we're often literally stuck in the noise because we can't make the measurements.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:24.500]   So actually the record holder for the most iron-poor star only has an upper limit.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.700]   We can't get enough data on this to actually pinpoint a measurement to then take it to
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:34.500]   our theory colleagues and say, "Give me this little iron out of your first star."
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:38.020]   So it's a bit frustrating, but also super exciting at the same time.
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.700]   - So let's go to both sides of that spectrum.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:46.060]   What's the most exciting discovery to you personally?
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:52.700]   Is there a moment you remember that you saw a piece of data and your heart skipped a bit?
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:56.620]   - Yeah, yeah, of course.
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.500]   - Is it HE 1327?
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.740]   - That was definitely one of those moments.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:05.180]   I wasn't actually present at the telescope, but we were sent the data immediately from
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.140]   our colleague.
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:13.100]   And we just looked at it and our eyes got really wide and it was like, "Oh my God, this
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.260]   is really what you think it is?"
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:18.660]   So we had to run some numbers and it was.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:22.620]   And these are magical little moments.
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:28.380]   The thing is, often we have false positives.
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:31.220]   And so there's always this kind of period.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:36.260]   And often it's, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes where you need to make some tests to kind
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:39.260]   of make the decision, "Is this really something I should keep observing now?
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.980]   Is this really as good as I think?
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.860]   Or am I being fooled by something?"
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:48.580]   So actually, if you take a spectrum of a white dwarf, a white dwarf is the leftover core
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:53.740]   of a star like the Sun that has gone extinct.
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:57.500]   And white dwarfs have lost all their outer atmosphere, so it's just the hydrogen-helium
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:02.180]   core, so they look like a metal-poor star because that's the only hydrogen-helium left,
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:03.180]   right?
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:07.060]   But the hydrogen lines that you can see in the spectrum of our stars and of the white
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:10.260]   dwarfs are a little bit wider than normal.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:15.900]   So you need to have a good eye just to check, "Does this look a little bit wider than us?
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.300]   Is this a white dwarf who's fooling me here?"
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:22.060]   And so it's like this moment, it's like, "Oh my God!"
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:23.980]   - It's just minutes of nervousness.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:25.060]   - Yes, yes.
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:30.340]   And sometimes it's a dud and sometimes it's not.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:32.900]   - What's been a big, that you remember, heartbreak?
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:34.980]   Like a painful low point?
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:37.500]   Is it all leading up to the first...
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.020]   Is it all about HE 1327 again?
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.020]   Just the leading up to it?
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:42.020]   Or has there been like a...
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:47.300]   Yeah, has there been like low points in this search?
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.860]   - That's a good question.
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:55.780]   I mean, you know, it starts with mundane things as in like, you won your telescope time, you
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:02.940]   traveled there, and the weather is completely cloudy, it rains, and you had three nights,
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:06.380]   which is a lot, and you go home empty-handed.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:09.820]   So that's definitely a low point.
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:13.940]   Probably not what you were thinking of, but there is a certain occupational hazard to
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:14.940]   it.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:18.460]   - Yeah, it requires a kind of resilience and a patience.
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.940]   - Yeah, and you just gotta learn to live with it.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:25.740]   Coming back to Reticulum 2, actually, you know, that little dwarf galaxy, that was a
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:29.740]   run that we had, and the weather was incredibly bad.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:36.980]   And I had sent my student there, and I was at home, and he calls me at 2 a.m., and he
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:41.180]   was like, "Anna, I think I observed the wrong star, I'm so sorry."
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:46.260]   There is this line there, this Europium line, and it looks like a metal-rich star.
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:50.940]   And I was like, "It's cool, we all make mistakes.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.980]   Send me the data, send me that summary plot."
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:57.020]   And so I look at it, you know, I was like super tired.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:04.180]   It's like, I can't really tell, it doesn't look wrong, but I can't tell you right now
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:09.020]   that it's right either, so why don't you go to the next target?
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:13.900]   And he calls me back an hour later, "Anna, it looks just the same!
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:16.680]   What am I supposed to do?"
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.940]   And then I joked, "Well, maybe we found an R-process galaxy.
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:23.100]   Let's go to the next one!"
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:26.460]   And the weather was degrading.
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:32.820]   And so to cut a long story short, we had to come -- so he was observing the right stars.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:41.700]   It was an R-process galaxy, the first one we had ever discovered, totally unpredicted.
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:46.620]   We had no idea that this was a thing.
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:53.740]   Of course we thought that such a thing might possibly exist, because why not?
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:39:01.020]   Neutron star mergers happen somewhere, crazy supernovae probably too, but we were not prepared
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:04.940]   in that moment to find this thing.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:12.180]   And in the end, the weather was getting worse and worse, and we wanted to see how many R-process
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.060]   stars are in this galaxy.
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:20.820]   So we managed by a hairline to observe the nine brightest stars, but the data quality
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.820]   was atrocious.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.780]   And the weather affects the data quality.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.220]   Yes, absolutely, because these were really faint stars.
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:35.660]   And so we were really lucky by making a very tight strategy of getting the absolute bare
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:41.580]   minimum for all the stars so we could at least take a very crude look, "Is it a yay or is
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:42.580]   it a nay?"
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:47.940]   We couldn't even say yes or no, just to get an idea, because we needed to know.
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:49.180]   Why was that important?
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:54.220]   Because we could only observe this system again nine months later.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.020]   So there's always a window of observation.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.020]   Yes.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:04.420]   So we were betting this was our chance, and it was going away with the clouds.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:06.020]   That was super high stakes.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:09.060]   But we just made it.
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:12.380]   Really, it was almost impossible.
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:18.780]   And the thing is, this is such a serendipitous moment.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:24.060]   In a serendipitous moment, the enhancement of these heavy elements was so strong that
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:29.700]   even in this really crappy data, we could still see the enhancement.
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:32.660]   The absorption was so strong that it stuck out of the noise.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:36.820]   If that enhancement wouldn't have been as strong, we would not have been able to say
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:40.440]   anything because we wouldn't have been able to tell.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:46.300]   But because it was so extreme, it lent us a hand, despite the weather and all, to say
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.940]   like, "Yes, this is it."
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:51.460]   So that was quite the night.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:55.940]   Luck, I mean, a lot of this is just luck.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.140]   So that was the first our process galaxy discovered.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.140]   Yes.
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:01.140]   I didn't sleep all that much.
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:03.740]   Do you have hope?
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:10.180]   Are you excited about James Webb Space Telescope and other telescopes in the future that increase
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:14.660]   the resolution and the precision of what can be detected out there?
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:15.660]   Absolutely.
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:17.700]   JWST is fantastic already.
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:23.180]   I am not planning to use it personally, although I think I'm on one or two observing proposals
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:28.540]   actually, because similar to what we already spoke about, we're interested in the same
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:29.540]   thing.
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:32.500]   We're just kind of looking at a different sides of the fence.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:37.860]   I have my old surviving stars and I concoct these little stories about what the earliest
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:43.860]   galaxies may have looked like, what the objects were that contributed energy and elements
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.700]   and all these things.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:51.300]   And my JWST colleagues, they try to detect some of these earliest photons from these
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:56.620]   earliest systems to look at the energetics and other things.
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:57.620]   What was there?
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:58.620]   How many?
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:59.620]   These kinds of things.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:06.220]   So together we're trying to explore this first billion years, but we do it in very complementary
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.220]   ways.
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:13.780]   And so I'm very excited to see what they can come up with and how that helps me to inform
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:17.660]   my stories better and more comprehensively.
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:22.980]   What do you think is the future of the field of stellar archaeology?
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:27.860]   How much can we, maybe what are the limits of our understanding of this first billion
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.620]   years of our universe?
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:36.460]   Well, obviously lots of limitations in the sense that I always say, I have a metal pore
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:43.020]   star for any of your questions, because there are so many different kinds out there.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:45.460]   And we still find new patterns sometimes, right?
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:46.820]   And there needs to be an explanation.
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:49.740]   The question is, is it ultimately just one quirky star?
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.540]   Is it two or is it three, right?
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.540]   Is it a sample?
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:53.540]   Is it a population?
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:56.140]   So we haven't concluded that kind of work yet.
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:01.660]   So every metal pore star is a kind of data point that you can use to improve the quality
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:05.020]   of your model of how the evolution of the early universe.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.020]   Yes, yes.
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:11.260]   And I would say we've made huge progress over the last 20 years.
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:15.780]   When I joined that field, it was in its infancy, and there was this serendipitous discovery
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:19.100]   of that first, second generation star.
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:23.700]   And we have filled in the canvas a great deal since then.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:29.340]   And this is what I have greatly enjoyed about doing so, because there was so much discovery
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:30.860]   potential.
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:36.980]   And it's been dying down a little bit because of all the progress.
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:43.820]   It's on the up and coming again because there are so many large spectroscopic surveys in
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:49.020]   the works now that will just provide a different level of data that we haven't had before.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:52.140]   I'm sort of of this older generation.
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.820]   I have only very few colleagues.
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:59.900]   I work in small teams, and I observe every single star myself.
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.540]   Whatever I can, I do myself.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:09.020]   I don't generally take other people's data, at least not certainly not in the end stage.
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:14.740]   And I'm not a big data kind of person, although we're all headed that way.
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:22.580]   I certainly use data from the Gaia astrometric satellite for the kinematics, for example.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:29.000]   But that's personally a new thing for me to use sort of big sky surveys that are available.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:35.740]   So it's still very sort of hand-grown field where we do our individual observations.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:39.460]   I have enjoyed that a lot, but that's about to change.
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:40.460]   - So one star at a time.
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.460]   - Yes.
[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:44.900]   - I mean, there's power to that, to build up intuition of the early universe by looking
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:47.060]   one star at a time.
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:50.740]   - And this is how you can really drill down on the questions that you have, right?
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:54.380]   Because you control what data you get.
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:56.820]   Otherwise you have the data that you have, right?
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.040]   You get what you get and you don't get upset.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:01.040]   I don't like that.
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:02.820]   I'm a little bit snobby.
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:07.920]   I really like to formulate my questions, go to the telescope and then come what may, I
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.060]   will try to get it.
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:13.220]   - And also develop the intuition of where the data can be relied upon and where it can't
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:16.100]   and all the different quirks of the data and all that kind of stuff.
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:20.700]   Sometimes a lot is lost in the aggregation of the noisy data.
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:22.460]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:26.180]   And that's always the danger if you have someone else's data that you just don't really understand
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:34.260]   the limitations, completeness things, how certain things were set up and you get out
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:35.460]   what you put in.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:39.780]   So I'm really particular about that and it certainly paid off for me.
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:45.580]   That's one of the main notions that I try to teach in my classes and to my students
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:50.860]   that you need to be able to formulate your question really well because otherwise you're
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:56.500]   going to get an answer to a different question, but you won't notice that the goalpost has
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:58.620]   shifted in the meantime, right?
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:01.620]   So your interpretation can only be as good as the question.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:04.140]   If you need to change your question, that's cool.
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:06.420]   Do it.
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:09.460]   But then it needs to pair up with your interpretation again.
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:15.980]   And so knowing, really being in the know about every step of what happens, that leads to
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:17.860]   quality results, I think.
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:22.260]   So I have sometimes a little trouble with sort of big data and statistical analysis.
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:24.860]   Yes, on average, that's true.
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:30.100]   I'm not debating that, but I'm the kind of person I like to look at the outliers, so
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:34.180]   not the bulk, but the special ones.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:37.500]   And they just need to be treated in a different way and there needs to be an acknowledgement
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:40.180]   of that, different ways for different things.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:46.460]   - So big data can look at divorce rates and perhaps you and I are more interested in the
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.220]   individual love stories.
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.220]   - Yes.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.220]   (laughing)
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.900]   That works for me.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:57.260]   - So I don't know if it's possible to say, but what do you think is the big discoveries
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:59.560]   that are waiting?
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:06.100]   Is it on the different dynamics of the yield, the common narrative, the common story of
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:11.220]   how some of these metal poor stars are formed?
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:14.940]   Where are the discoveries in this field that you think will come?
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:22.460]   - I think the individual discoveries are actually, we've made most of those, certainly through
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:26.420]   individual stars.
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:31.340]   Finding yet another second generation star is incredibly important for me, but isn't
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:33.940]   really going to move the needle.
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:38.580]   Finding 50 of them or 100 of them, that would move the needle, but that's in a word or two
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:41.100]   magnitudes up.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:48.100]   And new search techniques and new surveys may enable that, but would you still call
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.100]   that a discovery?
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:50.100]   - Sure.
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:51.100]   - Right?
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.460]   - So that's just a scale, that's a scale.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:53.460]   - Yes.
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.700]   So I think about it more like literally of the puzzle.
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:02.220]   Let's say you have a thousand piece puzzle and you have 900 pieces in there.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:05.620]   If you're a person like me, I want to get to the last ones.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:09.420]   I'm not going to leave it just like, okay, I see broadly what this is going to look like,
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:10.420]   right?
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:14.180]   I'm going to have, no, I want to get to the last one.
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:17.100]   Is the picture globally going to change?
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.100]   No.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:21.660]   Are we going to figure out all the details and how it really works?
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:22.660]   Yes.
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:30.300]   - So really careful, detailed map out the ancient stars of our universe.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:36.580]   - Yeah, because I think that's what many of us scientists are a little bit detail obsessed,
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:38.660]   but I think that's our job too, right?
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:45.780]   To really kind of make it airtight, to really walk away saying, I fully understand this,
[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:51.300]   not just broadly, but I really know, we really know now.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:56.020]   And so more and more of that is going to happen.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:58.740]   And so I think this is probably true across astronomy.
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:04.600]   These individual 10 sigma discoveries become less and less.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.580]   If they were easy, we would have made them already, right?
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:11.380]   Which means we have made many of them.
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:17.700]   But really filling in the details is the next sort of level of discovery.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.820]   Maybe we need to find a new word for that.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:27.460]   The hopes and expectations that go along with the word discovery are so enormous.
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:32.860]   We may not always be able to live up to that, but it doesn't mean that we're not finding
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:34.260]   out new things.
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:38.220]   It's just a different kind of quality because the questions have shifted.
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:43.100]   You close one door, suddenly there are 10 new open doors that we want to explore and
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:44.820]   march through.
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:50.100]   And that's finding these last puzzle pieces here and there that really make it airtight.
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:56.340]   - So there's a lot of value and a lot of power and beauty to the discovery in the big picture
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:58.540]   of our universe and in the details.
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:49:59.540]   - Yes.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:00.540]   - So both are really important.
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:03.740]   - We need both, absolutely.
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:10.340]   - Drifting into the philosophical, let me ask about the Big Bang as we kind of encroach
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:11.340]   onto it.
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:16.700]   So your work is kind of taking steps back through time in a weird way.
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:23.540]   Do you think we'll get to deeper and deeper understand the really, really early days of
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:25.260]   the Big Bang?
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:29.700]   And the philosophical question, do you think we'll be able to understand what was before
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:32.500]   the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened?
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.380]   Do you think about that stuff?
[01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:41.460]   - Not with stars, for better or for worse, because stars only probe the time when they
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.940]   were formed and the Big Bang is surely before then.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:51.220]   I mean, I often talk to my students about the difference between math and physics.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:53.300]   Let me give you an example.
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:58.700]   We talked earlier about 1815-23 and I was happy to share with you that I measure thorium
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.660]   and uranium, but I actually didn't quite close that loop.
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:09.020]   So we did this to try to attempt to calculate an age for these stars, right?
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:15.620]   But they rely on us knowing how the R process works, how these elements are created, where
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:21.140]   it happens, and then how those elements get dispersed into the gas and end up in the next
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:22.140]   generation star.
[01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:24.700]   So quite a few question marks.
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:28.740]   So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion years.
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:36.340]   This is probably not accurate, but this is the best calculation we could do.
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:41.140]   The reason why I'm bringing this up is that that was actually the average of multiple
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:45.820]   elemental ratios that each gave a certain age and then we averaged that because for
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:48.260]   better or for worse, this is the best we can do.
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:54.060]   So some of these numbers said, "Oh, this star is 15 billion years old."
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:56.540]   And then others said, "Oh, this is 10 billion years old."
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:52:02.780]   And so I often use that in my class to say, "What's the good news and what's the bad
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:04.580]   news here?"
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:07.660]   Some ratios say 15, some say 10, right?
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:11.140]   Is 15 correct?
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:14.580]   And then I ask them and some people will say something.
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:20.780]   And so the thing here is that it's an absolutely correct calculation given the mathematical
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:23.520]   and physical model that we constructed.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.860]   But does it make sense?
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:26.380]   No, it doesn't.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:34.020]   If we believe the universe is 13.8 billion years old, 15 is ridiculous, yet it is correct.
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:35.440]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:36.660]   Correct from a mathematics perspective.
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:39.860]   Yes, it is not incorrect because this is what I calculated.
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:41.140]   Nobody made a mistake.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:45.620]   Now we can question whether that's a good model, but that's a separate issue.
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:49.220]   So you're saying physicists are much closer to truth than mathematicians.
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:52.300]   Well, it depends.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.860]   Sometimes yes and sometimes no, right?
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:53:00.140]   So what our job as physicists is, is to take the mathematical model, calculate our numbers,
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:03.940]   and then ask the question, "Does this make sense?"
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:11.860]   Now in the case of 15, it doesn't, but we took the average anyway because that was the
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:13.500]   best we could do.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.320]   So all right, let's put that aside.
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:18.540]   Let's apply the same sort of thinking to the Big Bang.
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:23.300]   Math can tell us things that we as physicists cannot grasp because it doesn't make sense
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.300]   to us.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:29.380]   Now in the case of the Big Bang, that's a special case because we don't actually know
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:32.300]   what's supposed to make sense.
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:35.620]   And this is where things get interesting, but this is where math will ultimately be
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:40.940]   the winner because we can no longer say, "This makes sense," or, "This doesn't make sense,"
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.980]   because the physics is broken down.
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:46.180]   But math breaks down too in the singularity of things.
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:48.900]   Well, depending on who you ask.
[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:51.260]   Okay, sure, sure.
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.300]   This is the current question, right?
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:58.740]   How far, how much further can we push math, let's say, to the front of the Big Bang, if
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:00.860]   there is such a thing?
[01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:01.860]   What's the front and the back?
[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:02.860]   What's the front?
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:03.860]   The front is the...
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:04.860]   Before the Big Bang.
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:05.860]   Oh, before the Big Bang.
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:06.860]   The front, okay.
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:11.220]   Just to clarify, all the doorways and the entrances.
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:17.380]   So how far can we let the math go before that stops to make sense, right?
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:22.180]   And I don't know what the answer is to that, but it's really cool that because math is
[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:28.060]   not limited by our physical nature, it can probably go a little bit further than the
[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:29.060]   physics.
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:30.060]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:31.060]   Right?
[01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:34.820]   And math can go into more dimensions than four dimensions comfortably.
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:39.180]   And it's judgment-free because it just calculates things on its own.
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:41.940]   As physicists, we are so judgmental.
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.380]   This makes sense, this doesn't make sense, right?
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.860]   It doesn't get any worse.
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:49.540]   That's such a beautiful dance.
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:56.260]   It's so amazing that through this dance, you can explore the origins of the universe.
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:55:00.460]   Doesn't the Big Bang just blow your mind?
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:02.340]   This thing has just started from a point.
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:04.340]   And now we're here.
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:06.340]   Hydrogen and helium.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:14.140]   And then all the stuff you're studying, I mean, this evolution of chemistry created
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:18.660]   humans, and we're here talking.
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:21.580]   And there's a lot more to the story.
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:22.580]   It's amazing.
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:25.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:31.660]   And this kind of march that you're doing is observing data.
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:34.180]   Is there...
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.920]   You're looking at old light and old data.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:39.420]   But only a few thousand years, right?
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:40.620]   Just a few thousand years.
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:44.100]   That's the difference between me and my JWT colleagues.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:49.660]   Their objects, that light has traveled 13 billion years or whatever it was to us, and
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.340]   they're observing that now.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:54.740]   My light has only traveled a few thousand years.
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:55.740]   It's nothing.
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:58.540]   So whatever you observe now is likely still going on.
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:55:59.540]   Yes.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:03.700]   These stars are alive and kicking and having a blast.
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:05.060]   Thousand years.
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:06.700]   Just a few thousand years, that's all it takes.
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:12.140]   If we can travel close to the speed of light, maybe we can reach out there.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.860]   We wouldn't have any planets around those stars, though.
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:15.860]   So that's...
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:17.540]   Is that a definitive intuition?
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:20.180]   Well, what are planets made of?
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.180]   Elements, right?
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:23.700]   To take the Earth, all heavy elements, right?
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:29.460]   The universe needed to reach a certain stage first to have produced enough of all these
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:32.260]   elements to actually make a planet.
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:33.260]   So on average, you're...
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:34.260]   So, okay, right.
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:35.260]   So that took quite a few billion years.
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:38.140]   So they're not going to have a mechanism for forming planets.
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:42.900]   You could have visitors probably, but the kinematics of that are unlikely.
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.340]   Yeah, I would say so.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:52.660]   So they're interesting in that they reveal the early chemical evolution of the universe.
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:53.660]   Not that they're...
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:56.100]   They could be good vacation spots, but not...
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:59.540]   Well, if you like the warm.
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:05.580]   There's no planet islands to go to, to chill.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:11.940]   In your book, you highlight the major contributions in the field by many women.
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:18.820]   Some of these women were not, as you describe, immediately credited for their discoveries.
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:25.140]   So for me, from a computer science perspective, the story also tells Harvard computers.
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:30.940]   Who were these women and what can you just say about the nature of science and humanity?
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:34.260]   Discovering things is part of the human nature, right?
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:42.620]   And so it has happened for the longest time, not just by men, but also by many women.
[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:50.660]   The field of stellar astronomy, which is my field, has particularly benefited from many
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:51.920]   discoveries made by women.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.180]   You mentioned the Harvard computers.
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:58:04.260]   That's a term used for women who worked about 100 years ago at the Harvard College Observatory,
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:11.640]   and they were hired for their low wages and willingness to do diligent and patient work
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:16.260]   to comb through the big data of the day.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:23.700]   So the observatory director, they were carrying out large sky surveys at the time, and they
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:30.500]   needed -- that data needed to be processed and looked at and analyzed.
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:40.420]   And so many women, or several dozens, one or two dozen women over the years, were hired
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:42.060]   to do this work.
[01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:47.500]   And in the process, because they were looking at the actual data and they were smart, even
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:54.300]   though they had often no formal education, they made a lot of discoveries simply by being
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.700]   in tune with what they were doing.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:04.380]   So they weren't robots, as the term "computer" would perhaps lead on.
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:14.620]   So Annie Jump Cannon classified thousands and thousands of spectra and found out that
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:19.900]   you can -- stars have different temperatures and their spectra look according.
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:25.180]   We still use that classification sequence today.
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:32.100]   Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin later on, in I think 1925, was one of the first women to obtain
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:42.540]   a PhD in stellar astronomy, and she figured out, she calculated, that the Sun is mostly
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:45.980]   made of hydrogen and helium.
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:53.060]   That seems normal to many of us these days, but at the time, it was thought that celestial
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:56.220]   objects are made of the same thing as the Earth.
[01:59:56.220 --> 02:00:01.020]   That's a gutsy, amazing discovery.
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:02.020]   Yes.
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:09.940]   It was later termed the most important thesis of humankind or something like that.
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:15.420]   What a revelation to realize that stars are made of hydrogen and helium, right?
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:19.540]   This was exactly the time when people figured out why stars are shining, namely because
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:25.220]   of nuclear fusion and that it's protons and the tunneling effect that leads to the actual
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:26.220]   fusion.
[02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:31.700]   Otherwise, the protons repulse each other, they don't come together.
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:34.660]   And so what an incredible time it was back then.
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:40.540]   And so stars and nuclear physics were very closely related, and it remains.
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:43.460]   Now it's called nuclear astrophysics.
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:46.500]   And so many women had many contributions to that.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:51.460]   Of course, prior to that, Marie Curie discovered two new elements.
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:56.580]   Ah, so awesome!
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:59.900]   Radium and polonium.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:03.600]   Lisa Meitner discovered nuclear fission.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.820]   That is the basis for understanding the R process.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:12.020]   This is exactly what happens in the R process.
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:18.500]   The heavy nuclei, let's say uranium, if you bombard it with a neutron, we talked at length
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.220]   about it, it will decay.
[02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:27.020]   It will split into barium and krypton, let's say.
[02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:28.900]   So two lighter elements.
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:30.260]   That's exactly what we observe.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:34.180]   I have always a higher abundance of barium than the heavier elements because of this
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:42.480]   fission cycling that she calculated in 1938, 1939.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.300]   So many, many contributions, and it's just so remarkable.
[02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:56.000]   If you just take that body of work, that changed how we do things, how we see the universe,
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:03.120]   how we understand things has led to so many subsequent discoveries, good ones and bad.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.680]   Well, all of it is taken together.
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:08.680]   That's progress.
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:09.680]   Right.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.560]   Science is what it is.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:13.880]   We have to decide what we do with that knowledge, right?
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.960]   We can always use things for good or for bad.
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.160]   That's part of the human endeavor as well.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.880]   And also part of the human endeavor and the human nature is the issues with corruption
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.120]   and credit assignment and all these kinds of things that make this whole ride so damn
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.400]   interesting about what's right and wrong and about the nature of good and evil.
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.560]   And that seems to surface itself in all kinds of places all the time.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.560]   Yes.
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:44.120]   Lisa Meitner was nominated for the Nobel Prize 40 times.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:45.200]   More than that even.
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.200]   It's amazing.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:47.740]   She holds the record for that.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:49.660]   She never received it.
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:53.340]   So, case in point.
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:58.660]   Yeah, and of course the Nobel Prize has its complexities.
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:03.340]   One is the credit assignment, but two, even in astronomy, sort of assigning credit to
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:08.300]   a handful of folks when so many more contributed is a complicated story also.
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.060]   Yes, very complex.
[02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:16.340]   Okay, sorry for the romantic question, but what to use the most beautiful idea in astronomy,
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:18.500]   in stellar astronomy?
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:25.780]   Well, so early on, when I was in high school, I was thinking like, "Okay, what do I want
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:28.460]   to do when I grow up?"
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:32.900]   I knew I wanted to do astronomy, but I was a little bit torn because my interests were
[02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:36.980]   definitely stars, stellar astronomy, but also chemistry.
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:43.720]   I always had a fascination about the elements, so Marie Curie was a big role model.
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:52.100]   My friend actually produced a beautiful movie about the discovery of the elements.
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:04:00.520]   This is a theater play, but digitized, where when I saw it, I could actually kind of relive
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:03.700]   the sort of discovery moment that Marie Curie had.
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.420]   It sent shivers down my spine.
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:06.420]   It was fantastic.
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:12.980]   I mean, this is the kind of thing that I wanted to experience.
[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:18.660]   But yeah, so nuclear physics and element creation and formation was really interesting to me,
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.780]   chemistry, the elements, stars, and all of that.
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:26.700]   I was like, "I don't know if I ever find something that combines all of these things."
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:32.420]   Then I ended up in Australia, and I met this person, and he was working on old stars.
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:39.620]   As I was sitting in his talk, hearing about this for the first time, it kind of clicked
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:40.620]   all over my head.
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:46.900]   I was like, "Oh my God, it all fell in place because we can use these old stars to study
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:50.260]   the elements, to learn how they're formed.
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:56.660]   We can get these clean signatures that help us inform the nucleosynthesis processes."
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:59.980]   Of course, I need to know a lot about stars, too.
[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:05.500]   So it's like all together, and that was sort of a moment of magic.
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:12.100]   And then the fact that I have now done that for 20 years, it's just like I won the lottery.
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:14.420]   It all clicked into place.
[02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:19.620]   In some sense, it's an ongoing love story for me, if I could say it like that, where
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:28.940]   I found my stars, my thing, and I am fortunate enough to be able to keep doing that.
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:33.220]   I'm happy to see where it will take me.
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:38.060]   It's an evolution, as with every relationship.
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:40.700]   If you don't march forward, you move backwards.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:42.540]   I'm not interested in moving backwards.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:53.020]   So I'm letting the field and the discoveries and the findings lead me to, and I'm often,
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:56.060]   it's not hard for me to follow sort of my hunches.
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:06:00.780]   And sometimes even at the telescope, it's like, "Let's take a look at this one.
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:02.020]   I have a good feeling."
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:08.940]   And then usually something good or not bad pops out at the end.
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:15.220]   And I really like that, A, that I have the freedom to do that, that I'm allowed to follow
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:17.120]   my hunches.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:21.100]   Too many people I think are sort of boxed in with their job or their life, that they
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:22.740]   don't have that kind of freedom.
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:25.380]   That's really important to me, and I certainly try to make use of that.
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:30.820]   I also try to teach that to others, to trust them, to learn.
[02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:34.060]   You need to learn your things, but then you need to also trust that knowledge and that
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:35.500]   you have a grasp on it, right?
[02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:38.300]   You get out what you put in.
[02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:46.460]   And being able to contribute in meaningful ways to our knowledge about our cosmic ancestry
[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:53.980]   or cosmic history, that's a wonderful thing.
[02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:59.820]   In this way, your personal love story with the stars evolves.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:03.620]   What advice, you've already spoken to it a little bit, but what advice would you give
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:08.940]   to young people that are trying to find the same kind of love story in their career, in
[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.660]   their life?
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:16.260]   It seems increasingly hard for folks to find that.
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:25.880]   Sometimes I feel that young people have all the opportunities these days, and that's wonderful,
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:30.220]   but it's almost like that leads to some, what's the right word?
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:35.220]   They're a little bit too tired to make all the decisions because at some point you need
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:39.780]   to put your eggs in a basket, and you need to be okay with that.
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:44.620]   We can't do all the things, even though we're often told you can be president too, and I
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:47.460]   think that's really important to convey.
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:51.740]   But at the end of the day, we can only have one job or one type of profession.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:59.420]   I'm not saying you need to be locked in, but it's hard to change 180 degrees.
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:07.020]   And so lots of people, I think, are often afraid to really dig in, at least for some
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:11.580]   time, and get their hands real dirty and really learn from the bottom up.
[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:12.580]   On one thing.
[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:18.580]   On one thing, because they're afraid they're missing out on 99 other things.
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:23.140]   But life is a little bit missing out on 99 other things because we only have 24 hours
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:25.700]   in a day.
[02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:27.300]   I have that feeling very often.
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:32.580]   There are so many things I would like to do, many things I would like to try to be good
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:33.980]   at.
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:38.060]   Sometimes I wish I had a different job, because I have other interests too, but I realize,
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:42.560]   okay, I can only do one thing, so I have no regrets.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:48.540]   But this is a general feeling that I think most of us have.
[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:55.220]   But if it stops you from really drilling down on one thing, to become an expert on one thing,
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:09:03.100]   to become really good at one thing that you call your own, then it just makes it difficult.
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:08.820]   And so a fulfilling life is in part likely to be discovered in the singular pursuit of
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:10.300]   a thing, of one thing.
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.300]   Well, yeah.
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:12.660]   Or at least for a time.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:18.700]   Yeah, for some time, with your heart and your hands.
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:22.260]   Because I think most people long to own something.
[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:29.060]   You know, we all, I think, want to leave some legacy of some sort, you know, for our children,
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:32.840]   for humanity, for this planet.
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:38.940]   And I think it's really important for young people to strive for that and not lose sight
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:43.500]   or trade that for all the opportunities, because an opportunity is nothing if you don't do
[02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:44.740]   anything.
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:48.100]   You need to do something at the end of the day.
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:52.300]   So I chat with lots of people about this, and I often start by just saying, "Hey, tell
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:53.300]   me what you don't like."
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.500]   Because it's often much easier to...
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:00.460]   Just narrow down, narrow down, narrow down.
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:03.580]   Let out what's not on your plate.
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:07.300]   And then this way we get a little bit closer, and then it's like, "Well, why don't you take
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.300]   a risk?"
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.300]   Yeah.
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:11.220]   And just sign up for something for three months.
[02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:12.220]   But that's what it feels like.
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:13.220]   You can afford that.
[02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:16.060]   That's what it feels like, and it is that, is a risk.
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:17.060]   Commitment is a risk.
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:18.060]   Yes.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:20.940]   Because you're basically sacrificing all the other possible options.
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:25.220]   But then I guess you have to trust the magic you noticed in that thing.
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:26.220]   Yes.
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:28.500]   If you notice one thing, just stick with it.
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:30.780]   And then maybe there's something there.
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:31.780]   Right, right.
[02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:37.220]   And this moment of kind of feeling it in your entire body and mind that this is the right
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:42.020]   thing, getting there is probably really hard.
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:44.380]   But if you don't try, you won't find out.
[02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:46.020]   The hard stuff is the fun stuff.
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.660]   That's also another thing you find out.
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:49.340]   And then there is that, yes.
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:51.380]   Somehow, it doesn't make sense.
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:58.380]   You also mentioned that you've taken a little stroll into the artistic representation of
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:10:59.380]   yourself.
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:01.700]   Can you speak to that for a little bit?
[02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:02.700]   Yes.
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:05.500]   Well, I already just mentioned.
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:09.580]   Sometimes I wish I had more time to do other things.
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:17.900]   So I find little sideways, I guess, to pursue things that I like besides astronomy, or at
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.420]   least I try to find connections.
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:28.780]   And so some years ago, again, with the help of my friend who made this Marie Curie movie,
[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:37.340]   she and I wrote a one-woman play where I actually portray Lisa Meitner, who was an Austrian-German
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:40.780]   nuclear physicist from Germany.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:45.580]   So I have the right accent for that.
[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:51.460]   And we wrote this play about this moment of discovery of nuclear fission.
[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:59.340]   Again, this is an absolutely critical piece that explains my work today.
[02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:02.140]   And we all stand on the shoulder of giants.
[02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:03.660]   She was one of those giants.
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:10.260]   And in some ways, it's of course a way for me to acknowledge other people's work that
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:11.820]   have come before me.
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:19.060]   It's a wonderful way to highlight the contribution by a prominent woman.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:29.100]   And the way I do it is it's a 25-minute play in costume where I relive for people the moment
[02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:31.320]   of discovery.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:38.000]   Then I turn into myself, and then I give a 30-minute presentation on the art process
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.700]   and the creation of heavy elements, because the audience can now perfectly understand
[02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:49.780]   that, the public audience, given the historic backdrop of this discovery that they just
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:53.420]   lived through my presentation.
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:59.460]   And it's a wonderful complement that almost spends 100 years from one woman to the next
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:02.020]   passing on the torch.
[02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:08.680]   And when we write up our results in, let's say, in magazines like Nature and Science,
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:15.920]   it's always about the results on the golden platter, perfectly prepared.
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:21.120]   The discovery is never described, only ever the results.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:26.200]   You asked me beforehand, right, what does it feel to be at the telescope in this moment,
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:27.200]   right?
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:31.880]   I'm happy to talk about this, but it's nowhere written, never.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:33.660]   Nobody really talks about it.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:43.040]   And so having a form of theater, of the arts, to bring this exciting moment that is what
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:51.100]   we all want to experience as scientists to a wider audience is so profound and so rewarding.
[02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:55.460]   And they all love it because everyone can understand a moment of discovery.
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:58.140]   I was looking for something, and then I found it.
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:02.420]   It's like you misplaced car keys, right?
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:03.420]   Or love.
[02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:04.420]   Yes, yes.
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:05.420]   Everyone can understand it.
[02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:08.540]   What a glorious experience, yes.
[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:15.180]   The implications and the findings, that is much harder to understand for anyone.
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:18.280]   This is where the scientists' work truly lies.
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:19.700]   This is our job.
[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:25.580]   But the moment of discovery is easy, and it's beautiful, and it needs to be said.
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:30.540]   And so taking my audience on this journey, what is the perils?
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.540]   What are my worries?
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:35.220]   And then, ah, here is the moment of discovery.
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.180]   Let me tell you about it.
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:42.140]   It profoundly transformed me, and here's how it went, right?
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:43.140]   It's so good.
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:48.020]   And art is a way to reveal this fundamental human side of science.
[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:49.020]   Yes.
[02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:51.660]   The problem with science is that it's people doing it.
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:54.700]   Maybe not a problem, but that is it.
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:57.460]   That's also what makes it beautiful, right?
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:15:01.200]   Humans are fascinating, and that we're able to come up with these ideas through all the
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:05.300]   struggle, through all the hardship, through all the hope, through all the search.
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:11.340]   And so the art's a great way to portray that and to broadcast that, right?
[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:16.040]   I think this is how the audience really should be interacting with scientists, much less
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:20.540]   about the findings, but really more about this yearning for answers, right?
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:22.540]   I need to find these khakis.
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:24.700]   I need it because I need to go, right?
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:27.220]   It's like, now, now!
[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:28.900]   And then, oh, God, here it is.
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:31.900]   Now I can go my merry ways.
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:33.680]   It's so relatable.
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:36.980]   We just need to find more and better ways to do that.
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:42.500]   So I hope to turn this into also a digitized version at some point to, again, make it more
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:43.500]   accessible.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:44.500]   I hope so, too.
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:45.500]   I would love to see it.
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:48.580]   So far, I'm just doing it in person.
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:49.580]   But it's a nice-
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:50.580]   I would love it.
[02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:53.900]   I think a lot of people would love to see it, so I hope you do just that.
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:56.060]   Let me ask you a big, ridiculous question.
[02:15:56.060 --> 02:16:02.800]   You look up at the stars, you look up at the early, early, early stars.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:06.900]   So let me ask the big question that we humans often ask and struggle to answer.
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:10.180]   What's the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:13.380]   Why are we here?
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:18.020]   - We talked about the biological evolution requires the chemical evolution for all of
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:22.100]   this to kind of play out, and carbon played this important role.
[02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:27.420]   And in some sense, we're just a consequence of all of these things being the way they
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:28.540]   are, right?
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:36.540]   So maybe this is just where we are supposed to be, because the laws of physics sort of
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:38.660]   work the way they do.
[02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:46.500]   And we talked much about the variety of everything, really, and certainly from over here to over
[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:54.260]   there and things in the vicinity of where the sun and the solar system formed, they
[02:16:54.260 --> 02:17:00.180]   were the way they were, and life maybe was a necessary consequence of that.
[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:04.100]   In some sense, I like to believe that, because then it becomes reproducible, and we can apply
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:06.540]   that same argument elsewhere.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:09.700]   If it's total chance, right, that makes it harder.
[02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:13.380]   That's not truly satisfying to a scientist.
[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:20.220]   - So it's a consequence of psychological evolution, which is a consequence of biological evolution,
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:24.140]   which is a consequence of chemical evolution, consequence of physical evolution, whatever
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:26.140]   disciplines.
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:28.380]   It's turtles on top of turtles.
[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:30.380]   - Turtles all the way down, yes.
[02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:34.300]   - And you have studied some of the most ancient turtles.
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.300]   - Yes.
[02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:36.300]   - At the very bottom of the thing.
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:37.300]   - That's right.
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:38.300]   They live for quite a while.
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:39.300]   - Yes, they do.
[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:43.820]   Well, thank you for your incredible work.
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:49.020]   Thank you for highlighting both the human side and the deep scientific side.
[02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:51.860]   It's just, I'm a huge fan of your work, and thank you for everything you do.
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:53.380]   And thank you for talking today.
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.380]   This was awesome.
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:55.700]   - Of course, it was wonderful.
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:56.700]   Thank you.
[02:17:56.700 --> 02:17:59.540]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Adam Furbel.
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:03.860]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:07.900]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Douglas Adams in "Hitchhiker's Guide
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:09.940]   to the Galaxy."
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:16.900]   Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:21.140]   of the galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun.
[02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:26.340]   Orbiting this, at a distance of roughly 92 million miles, is an utterly insignificant
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:32.660]   little blue-green planet whose abe-descendant life forms are so amazingly primitive that
[02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:37.740]   they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
[02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:38.740]   Thank you for listening.
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:40.420]   I hope to see you next time.
[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:40.500]   [END]
