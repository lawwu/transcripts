[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.760]   And then it's like, I always consider the universe like a, you know,

[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.100]   And then these first supernova explosions kind of provided the salt,
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.020]   you know, just a little sprinkle of heavier elements.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.060]   And that made it really tasty. Mm-hmm.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.260]   It just changed it completely. Right.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.220]   And that changed the physics of the gas.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.260]   So that meant that these, these gas clouds,

[00:08:52.220 --> 00:09:20.960]   You're looking. I'm. Actually, it depends a little bit in the northern hemisphere. We're looking out of the galaxy. So we're seeing the next outer spiral form. And as you can imagine, there's only dark space behind that. So we don't see it all that nice on the sky. But if you travel to south to the southern hemisphere, let's say South America, you see the Mickey and it looks so different on the sky because that's the next in our spiral arm and that's backlit.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.660]   The galactic.

And you're just kind of looking right into it and you can you can really feel that we're in this 2d disc and then you can imagine that there's a top and the bottom and that we really part off the galaxy you can really experience that we're just not not just lost in space somewhere but we're really a part of it and you know knowing a little bit about the structure of the Mickey will really help.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.700]   know a little bit about the structure of the Mickey will really help. How we supposed to feel.

[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:33.340]   gravitationally bound systems and then the make you a grew from absorbing neighboring smaller even smaller systems and somewhere in that process there must have been a seed for one of these super massive black

[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.180]   There's some interesting physics there.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:18.580]   But it's just a different flavor and I don't do these kinds of calculations myself either.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:27.720]   I very much like to talk with my theory colleagues about these things though because I find there's always an interesting intersection and

[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.740]   I've written a number of papers with colleagues who do simulations about galaxies and so they're not quite as far removed as let's say the black hole pen and paper folks. But even in those cases we have the same interest in the same topics but it was almost like we're speaking two different languages and we weren't even that far removed you know both astronomers and all and it was really interesting just to take the time and
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:27.760]   the time and
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:27.760]   the time and

[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:57.780]   I think that's a really interesting thing and sometimes it really takes a while to to convert and to to get you know to the common ground but if you take the time it's so interesting to participate in that process and it feels so good in the end to say yes we tackled this together right we overcame our differences not not so much in opinion but just in expressing ourselves about this and how we go about solving a problem and these were some of my most successful papers and I certainly enjoyed them the most.

So we don't actually, I had to say that because I love stars. We don't at the end of the day, we don't really care for the stars that we're observing. We care for the story that they're telling us about the early universe.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:57.860]   So, yeah. So the stars are kind of a small mirror into the, the, the early universe.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:03.460]   And so what are you detecting about those stars? Can you tell me about the process of archeology here?

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.860]   Yeah.

To map up an entire research project basically from scratch in ten worksheets. So that they could do it again in a very structured and organized fashion. Oh so you created this whole framework for them to do it. Yes. The whole thing. But the promise was you come sign up for my class in teams of two. You each get your own

[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   Okay let's use this opportunity you're going to do some extra work with me and we're going to publish this

[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:56.760]   publish this I also like that
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   publish this I also like that you're using the terminology of chemically more pristine when I'm talking to younger people I'll just say that I'm more chemically pristine than them I like that description of age so there's this term of metal poor stars so most of these old stars are going to be metal poor yes I search for the most metal poor stars

[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   When I give public talks I always ask, "Is there a chemist in the audience?" Let me just tell you, neon is a wonderful metal. And they're like, "Oh my god, what's he saying?" But I'm an astronomer, I'm not a chemist, so I'll get away with it. So if you just roll with it for a moment, all the elements except hydrogen and helium are called metals. Now if we look again at chemical or the concept of chemical evolution, it means more and more off of the chemical evolution.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:42.820]   All the elements, everything heavier than hydrogen and helium gets produced slowly but surely by different types of stores and events. So that's a monotonously increasing function. And so we look for the stars that have the least amount of heavy elements in them, because that means we are going further and further back in this process, in that function, almost all the way to the very beginning, and that is the first star.

[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:25.540]   And, you have hydrogen helium still on the outskirts. And, then you have your layers of heavy and heavy elements all the way up to iron. So, you have an iron core in the center.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:34.540]   And, because you can't get any energy out of iron when you want to fuse to iron atoms anymore. Right? That's when the supernova explodes.

[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.520]   It's actually an implosion first. And, then you have a bounce.

[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:52.520]   underway. So when you want to explore the early universe. So there are two questions now that that's kind of come to mind. Where do these elements come from? And what what do they tell us? Right? And these, as we know, these heavy elements are made in a specific process. It's a neutron capture process, usually referred to as the R process for rapid neutron
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:52.520]   Capture process.
[00:59:52.540 --> 01:00:21.480]   So we still don't exactly know where this process can occur. So you have, let's say, a lone iron atom somewhere. And it is in an environment where you have a strong neutron flux, which means then must be lots of neutrons around. And again, when we talk about the site we can surmise and ponder where where that might be the case. But you have this iron atom and you bombard it with neutrons and you do it in a way that's very important for the future.

[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   You see the waves coming? So that's exactly what happens when two neutron stars merge. And this is neutrons galore, right? It's really violent to smash two neutron stars, you know, so that are so dense already into each other. And, they in 2017, one of these events occurred and the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories, they detected that. And then the astronomers
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   The observatories who were in the observatory. They detected that. And then the astronomers
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:11.580]   provide

[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   I I a ring. I'm going to find reticulum 2 and it has these, the stars show the signature of the rapid neutron capture process, the R process. And we are like, okay, these stars are located in a dwarf galaxy right now. We have environmental information. They are not lost in the galaxy where we don't know where they actually came from. No, we know these stars were formed in that galaxy because they're still in it. And that we already deduced from that, that it must have been a neutron star merger that went on for a long time.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:09:14.300]  obedient. But I think it's important that we understand the importance of the fact that these stars are not lost in the galaxy because there are leftovers from the early universe, right? They did not get eaten. So they're still in their native surroundings. I go, it's like getting the lions in the wild, right? I got to study those and compare to the counterparts that got eaten and are now in the Milky Way. And so I.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.740]   So presumably, most of those stars, not all those stars network out, they're really ancient.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:47.040]  , because actually, as it turns out, if you have a small galaxy, there was a process early on in the universe called reionization that kind of heated up everything. And together with some supernova explosions in an early shallow bound system, all these little systems lost their gas. It was sort of blown out or it simply evaporated or both, probably both.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:47.600]   And so these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.100]   And so these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:48.140]   And so these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   And so these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   And so these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   And so these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   And so these little systems lost their gas.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   reionization and they kind of reionization and they kind of heated up everything.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   reionization and they kind of all of the universe.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.240]   And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:52.320]   And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:52.500]   And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since. Mm hmm.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:52.600]   Mm hmm.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:52.640]   Mm hmm. So it's the best for us stellar archaeologists that you could hope for because it's a whole bunch of stars still sitting there. It's not just one. It's a whole bunch of them still sitting there ever since and nothing has, literally nothing has happened to them. They've just been waiting there for us.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:10:09.580]   Mm hmm. So it's the best for us stellar archaeologists that you could hope for because it's a whole bunch of stars still sitting there ever since and nothing has, literally nothing has happened to them. They've just been waiting there for us.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:33.820]   Mm hmm. So from the stellar archaeology perspective, what is juicier and more interesting, the old stars and the outskirts that have been eaten, the outskirts in the Milky Way or the stars in the dwarf galaxies? Of all the things you love about the world--. You said you love stars. So which do you love more of your children?
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:59.560]  , I love them all.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.060]   Mm hmm.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.060]   That's a hard one.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.060]   I mean, I love them all.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:02.560]   Okay.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.060]   Of course.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:03.560]   They serve different purposes.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   The stars in the Milky Way, I can get much, much, much better data for them because they're brighter. They're closer, so they're brighter. And that tickles my fancy.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   And they have interesting kinematics presumably.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   Yes, and we can get that. And so HG 1523, for example, that one is really bright. It's a red line, so it's intrinsically bright and it's fairly close.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   So it's a red line, so it's intrinsically bright and it's fairly close.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   I mean, but it's a lot of course, it's not just a lot of the stars.

[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.100]   eyeball the disrespectful least, and,
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:41.080]   we call it absorption lines to then calculate with existing codes that mimic the physics of the stellar atmosphere.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:47.760]   It's like how much was absorbed, how many, what, what kind of elements were, were present in, in the stellar atmosphere.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.140]   And so this is how we get to our abundance measurements.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:58.220]   And then altogether that gives us the, the, the chemical composition and, and that particular signature in that style.
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:02.520]   If you, do you ever look at like the raw spectrograph and the absorption line?
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:02.520]   The raw spectrograph and the absorption line?

[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:31.440]   I'm able to see into it some interesting non-standard outlier kind of patterns. Or does this have to do heavy amount of processing? We actually process our, it's fairly straightforward to do our processing. We do it at the telescope so I often take a shorter exposure first, let's say 10 or 15 minutes. So mostly when I do the first one, I do the second one.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.640]   So mostly when I do the first one, I do the second one.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:39.820]   We just take a quick look spectrum, then we process it while we observe the next star.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.360]   Then we take a quick look.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.280]   We have what I call the summary plot.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:49.240]   It's a collection of little areas in the spectrum that have the key positions,
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:52.420]   the positions of the key elements in it.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:55.220]   And it's kind of like reading the tea leaves.
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.340]   I have stared at so many spectra.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:00.480]   I just need to know, I just need to see our summary plot.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:30.520]  ,

[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:59.760]   IGNORE: Not with stars. For better or for worse. Because, you know, stars only probe the time when they were formed and the Big Bang is surely before then. I mean, I often talk to my students about the difference between math and physics. Let me give you an example. We talked earlier about HE1523 and, you know, I was happy to share with you that I made a story on uranium but I actually didn't quite close it.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:50:59.760]   I made a story on uranium but I actually didn't quite close it.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:50:59.760]   I made a story on uranium but I actually didn't quite close it.

[01:50:59.860 --> 01:50:59.900]   I made a story on uranium but I actually didn't quite close it.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:50:59.960]   I made a story on uranium but I actually didn't quite close it.
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:01.260]   I made a story on uranium but I actually didn't quite close it.
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:28.980]   I made a story on uranium but I actually didn't quite close it. So we did this to try to attempt to calculate an age for these stars, right? But they rely on us knowing how the R process works, how these elements are created, where it happens and then how those elements get dispersed into the gas and end up in the next generation star. So quite a few question marks. So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not a big deal.
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:58.100]  , but this is the best calculation we could do.
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:58.140]   So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not a big deal.
[01:51:58.140 --> 01:51:58.240]   So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not a big deal.

[01:51:58.320 --> 01:51:58.400]   So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not a big deal.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:58.440]   So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not accurate.

[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:41.960]   And so it has happened for the longest time, not just by men but also by many women.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:42.600]   And so it has happened for the longest time, not just by men but also by many women.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:47.240]   And the field of stellar astronomy, which is my field,

[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:23.480]   is the big data of the day.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:24.120]   is the big data of the day.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:28.120]   is the big data of the day. So the observatory director,
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:28.200]   So the observatory director,
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.440]   So the observatory director, they were carrying out large sky
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:30.440]   they were carrying out large sky
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:33.720]   they were carrying out large sky surveys at the time and they needed
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:33.720]   surveys at the time and they needed
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.760]   surveys at the time and they needed that data needed to be processed
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:36.840]   that data needed to be processed
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.840]   that data needed to be processed and looked at and analyzed.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:38.920]   and looked at and analyzed.
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.240]   and looked at and analyzed. And so many women, several
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:42.280]   And so many women, several dozens, one or two dozens women over the years,
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:42.280]   And so many women, several dozens, one or two dozens women over the years,
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:42.920]   And so many women, several dozens, one or two dozens women over the years,
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:59:12.880]   "I'm not sure if the data is real,
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:12.880]   "I'm not sure if the data is real,

[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:14.440]   but I'm sure we can do this." And so they were doing that.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:14.440]   And so they were doing that.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.720]   And so they were doing that. You can, you know,
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:15.720]   You can, you know,

[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.720]   starts at different temperatures and their spectra look according.
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:19.720]   and their spectra look according.
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.400]   and their spectra look according. We still use that classification
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:21.400]   We still use that classification

[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:30.360]   in, I think, 1925 was one of
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:34.840]   in, I think, 1925 was one of the first women to obtain a PhD
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:58.880]   the first women to obtain a PhD
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:00.880]   the first women to obtain a PhD in stellar astronomy.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:00.880]   in stellar astronomy.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:04.800]   in stellar astronomy. And she figured out, she calculated,
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:04.800]   And she figured out, she calculated, that the Sun is mostly made
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:04.800]   that the Sun is mostly made of hydrogen and helium.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:04.800]   of hydrogen and helium. That seems normal to many of us these days,
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:04.800]   That seems normal to many of us these days, but at the time it was thought that
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:04.800]   but at the time it was thought that celestial objects are made of the same thing as the Earth.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:04.800]   celestial objects are made of the same thing as the Earth. That's a gutsy, amazing discovery.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:04.800]   That's a gutsy, amazing discovery. Yes. It was later termed the most important
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:08.760]   thesis of humankind or something like that.
[02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:12.760]   thesis of humankind or something like that. What a revelation to realize that stars
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:12.760]   What a revelation to realize that stars
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.840]   What a revelation to realize that stars are made of hydrogen and helium, right?

[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.920]   are made of hydrogen and helium, right? And this was exactly the time when
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:16.920]   And this was exactly the time when
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:18.440]   And this was exactly the time when people figured out why stars are
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:18.440]   people figured out why stars are

[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.520]   shining, namely because of nuclear fusion and that it's protons and

[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:23.960]   fusion and that it's protons and you know, the tunneling effect that

[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:06.720]   Well, we did all of it is taken together.
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:08.720]   It's that progress, right?
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:10.720]   It's it's awesome. It's science is what it is.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:13.720]   We have to decide what we do with that knowledge, right?
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.720]   We can always use things for good or for bad.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:20.720]   That's that's part of the human endeavor as well.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.720]   And also part of the human endeavor and the human nature is the issues with corruption and credit.
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:54.760]  , and all these kinds of things that are and make this whole ride so damn interesting about what's right and wrong and about the nature of good and evil. And that seems to surface itself in all kinds of places all the time. Yes, yes. Lisa Meitner was nominated for the Nobel Prize 40 times. More than that even. It's amazing. She holds the record for that. She never received it. Case in point.

I'm not interested in moving backwards. So I'm letting the field and the discoveries and the findings lead me to the things that I love.

[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:44.680]   Um, too many people I think are sort of boxed in with their job or their life that they don't have that kind of freedom that that's really important to me and I certainly try to make use of that I also try to teach that to others to trust them to learn, you need to learn your things, but then you need to also trust that knowledge and you have a grasp on it right you get out what you put in and being able to contribute in meaningful ways to our knowledge about our cosmic ancestors.

[02:06:45.360 --> 02:07:13.440]  , um, that's that's a wonderful thing.
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:13.440]   And in this way, your personal love story with the stars evolves.
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:13.440]   What advice you've already spoken to it a little bit, but what advice would you give to young people that are trying to find the same kind of love story in their career in their life?
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.480]   It seems increasingly hard for folks to to find that.
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:14.640]   And I think that's a really important thing that we have to do.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:14.640]   And I think that's a really important thing that we have to do.
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:25.160]   Sometimes I feel that, you know, young people have all the opportunities these days and that's that's wonderful.
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:30.080]   But it's almost like that leads to some what's the right word there?
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:38.840]   They're a little bit of tired of too too tired to make all the decisions because at some point you need to put your eggs in a basket and you need to be okay with that.
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:44.600]   You can't do all the things even though we're often told you can be president too.
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:44.600]   And I think that's a really important thing that we have to do.
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:44.600]   We can't do all the things even though we're often told you can be president too.

[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:14.560]   and I think that's really important to convey.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:14.560]   and I think that's really important to convey.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:14.560]   But at the end of the day, we can only have sort of one job or one type of profession.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:14.560]   But at the end of the day, we can only have sort of one job or one type of profession. I'm not saying you know you need to be locked in, but it's hard to change 180 degrees. And so lots of people I think are often afraid to really dig in at least for some time and get their hands real dirty and really learn from the bottom up.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:14.560]   And I think that's a really important thing that we have to do.
