[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.600]   Today, we are discussing peptides.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.760]   Peptides are a topic
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.320]   that's receiving a lot of attention these days,
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.000]   in part because of the excitement
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.440]   about the so-called GLP-1 analogs or agonists.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.400]   GLP-1 stands for glucagon-like peptides.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.500]   These are drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200]   as well as drugs used to treat obesity.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.680]   Today, we are not going to discuss the GLP-1 analogs.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.480]   However, we are going to discuss
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.640]   some of the other peptides
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.120]   that are receiving a lot of attention these days,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.200]   including peptides for tissue healing and repair,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.600]   as well as peptides that impact longevity and vitality.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.520]   Now, in principle,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.900]   any discussion about peptides could be enormously vast,
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.740]   and that's because
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.760]   there are so many different kinds of peptides.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   And by the way, I will explain what a peptide is
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.040]   in just a few moments.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.580]   But for instance, insulin,
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.520]   which is involved in regulating our blood sugar
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.960]   or blood glucose levels, is a peptide.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.520]   Oxytocin, which is sometimes called the love hormone,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.640]   although I wouldn't say that's the best description
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.040]   of what oxytocin is.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.600]   It's a neuropeptide/hormone
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.720]   that is involved in everything
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.400]   from pair bonding to socialization,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.280]   but a bunch of other things as well.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.960]   Those are just two examples of peptides
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.600]   that are familiar to most people, at least by name,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.320]   and that exist within the tens of thousands,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.560]   if not hundreds of thousands of different peptides
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.960]   that exist within our brain and body.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.560]   Today's discussion is going to focus on peptides
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.080]   that are increasingly being used for therapeutic purposes.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.100]   And I want to point out something very important
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.640]   about this topic area.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.820]   First of all, it is a topic area
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.280]   for which there is a lot of confusion.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.400]   The mere naming of the peptides is confusing.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.520]   Oftentimes they're referred to simply by virtue
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.080]   of acronyms and numbers like BPC-157 or MK-677,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.300]   et cetera, et cetera,
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.160]   such that if you're not really familiar with them,
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.600]   it can be a bit overwhelming and confusing.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.680]   Today, I'm going to provide
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.600]   a very simple organizational framework
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.220]   that will allow you to understand
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.840]   what these different therapeutic peptides are,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.640]   why certain ones may be advantageous for certain purposes,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800]   of course, also highlighting the potential risks
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040]   and in some case, outright dangers,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.960]   and I'll tell you how they each work alone
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.440]   and in combination toward achieving specific physical
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.760]   and in some cases, even mental health goals.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480]   I'd be remiss if I didn't say at the outset here
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.900]   that a lot of what's happening
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.540]   with applied therapeutic peptide biology
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420]   falls into one of three categories.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.620]   There are peptides that are being prescribed by physicians.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.660]   So these are prescription peptides for specific purposes.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.180]   These are FDA approved.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.820]   There are other peptides that reside
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.960]   in kind of a gray market area.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.940]   You can purchase them online,
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.580]   but the safety and efficacy of those peptides
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.420]   is a bit questionable, in some cases, very questionable.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.320]   And I'll give you some filters to determine
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   which category certain peptides fall into.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.300]   And then of course, there's the black market peptides.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.220]   It is possible to buy peptides online
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.060]   through any number of different sources.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.560]   And of course, I do not suggest people
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.140]   purchase black market peptides.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.300]   It's very clear that a lot of them are contaminated
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   with things that both in the short term,
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.000]   but especially in the longterm can be problematic.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.680]   So if you're interested in understanding
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.620]   or using therapeutic peptides,
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.320]   today's episode is for you.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.020]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.620]   that this podcast is separate
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.900]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.020]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.900]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.940]   about science and science related tools
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.400]   to the general public.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.500]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.420]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.260]   Our first sponsor is Martina.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.660]   Martina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.700]   I often discuss yerba mate's benefits,
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.240]   such as regulating blood sugar,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.660]   it's high antioxidant content,
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.960]   the ways that it can improve digestion,
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.160]   and possible neuroprotective effects.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   I also drink yerba mate because I love the taste.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.140]   While there are a lot of different choices
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.160]   of yerba mate drinks out there,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.340]   I love Martina because again,
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.380]   they have the no sugar variety,
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.620]   as well as the fact that both their loose leaf
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.220]   and their canned varieties
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.660]   are of the absolute best quality.
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.500]   So much so that I decided to become a partial owner
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.460]   in the company.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.820]   Although I must say,
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.120]   even if they hadn't allowed me to do that,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.500]   I would be drinking Martina.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.320]   It is the cleanest tasting and best yerba mate you can find.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.560]   I love the taste of brewed loose leaf Martina yerba mate,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.020]   and I particularly love the taste
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.600]   of Martina's new canned cold brew,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.520]   zero sugar yerba mate,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.280]   which I personally helped them develop.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.760]   If you'd like to try Martina,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.240]   go to drinkmartina.com/huberman.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.920]   Right now, Martina is offering a free one pound bag
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.960]   of loose leaf yerba mate tea and free shipping
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.380]   with the purchase of two cases
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.240]   of their cold brew yerba mate.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.660]   Again, that's drinkmartina.com/huberman
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.320]   to get the free bag of yerba mate loose leaf tea
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.640]   and free shipping.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.740]   how different foods and different activities
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.120]   and your sleep patterns impact your health
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.280]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.380]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.640]   Now, blood glucose, sometimes referred to as blood sugar,
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.960]   has an immediate and long-term impact
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.120]   on your energy levels and your overall health.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.400]   One of the best ways to maintain focus and energy
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.560]   throughout your day,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.620]   as well as to keep your so-called metabolic health
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.280]   in best order, is to make sure
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.720]   that your blood glucose never spikes too much,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   nor does it get too low.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.280]   With Levels, you can monitor how different foods
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.380]   and food combinations impact your blood glucose levels
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.080]   on a moment-to-moment basis.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.200]   I've been using Levels for some time now,
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.760]   and it's really helped me understand
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.740]   which foods and food combinations,
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.960]   exercise schedules and sleep schedules
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   are optimal for my blood glucose levels
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   and how that translates to energy levels
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.640]   and other metrics of health.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.560]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.640]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.120]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.260]   Levels has just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.560]   and has even better tracking than before.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.840]   Right now, they're also offering
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.300]   two free months of membership.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.000]   Again, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.980]   to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.860]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.160]   Juve makes medical-grade red light therapy devices.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.320]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.620]   on this podcast, it's the incredible role
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.960]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.480]   And of course, I'm always telling people
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.040]   that they should get sunlight in their eyes
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.520]   as soon as possible after waking
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.000]   on as many days of their life as possible
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.480]   for sake of setting circadian rhythm,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.600]   daytime mood focus and alertness, and improve sleep.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.400]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.180]   red light and near-infrared light
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.600]   has been shown to have positive effects
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.960]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.360]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.480]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.220]   even improvements in acne, or that is removal of acne,
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.980]   reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.840]   improving mitochondrial function,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.380]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.360]   What sets Juve apart
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.720]   and why it's my preferred red light therapy device
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.620]   is that it has clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.420]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.660]   and near-infrared light in combination
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.280]   that trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.440]   Personally, I use the Juve handheld light
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.940]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.300]   It's only about the size of a sandwich.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.940]   It's very convenient to use.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.000]   I also have a Juve whole body panel,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.720]   and I use that about three or four times a week.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.840]   If you would like to try Juve,

[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.240]   So what is a peptide?
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.220]   A peptide is a small protein
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.280]   that's made up of little chains of amino acids.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.880]   Now, the moment people hear protein,
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.080]   they usually think proteins that you eat,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.960]   or perhaps they think about four calories per gram
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.640]   of protein and that sort of thing.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.500]   Keep in mind that we have lots of different kinds
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.140]   of proteins within our body
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.120]   that have nothing to do with the proteins that we eat.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.240]   Now, it is true that many of the amino acids
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   that comprise peptides,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.800]   as well as other proteins in the body,
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.740]   come from the foods that we eat,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.000]   because the amino acids, again,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.500]   are the building blocks of peptides and other proteins.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.480]   The basic way that we define a peptide
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.960]   is that it tends to be a small protein,
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.900]   meaning chains of anywhere from two to 50 amino acids.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.280]   That's really the strict definition of a peptide.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.560]   However, oftentimes, peptides that are a little bit bigger,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.320]   so maybe 75 or 100 amino acids in length,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.480]   will also be considered a peptide.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.040]   Now, if you start combining different peptides together,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.680]   you get what's called polypeptides,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.400]   and many of the proteins in the body are polypeptides.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.720]   So just to get a mental image of what a peptide is,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.520]   a peptide basically looks like beads on a string
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.320]   where there are two to 100 beads,
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.400]   and each of those beads represents a different amino acid,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.520]   and the arrangement of each amino acid
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.880]   relative to one another,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   that is, their order along that string,
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.360]   determines what the peptide is and what the peptide does.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.760]   The other thing that's important to understand
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.680]   about peptides is that some peptides are hormones,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.880]   other peptides are merely called peptides, proteins,
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.240]   others are neuromodulators,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.280]   meaning they adjust the activity of neurons,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.160]   and some peptides multitask and do many things.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.880]   In fact, I think it's fair to say that most peptides
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.220]   have what are called pleiotropic effects,
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.600]   meaning they affect many different aspects of cells.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.540]   And this is very important to understand
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.500]   because unlike a lot of our discussion on this podcast
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.800]   about dopamine or about specific hormones
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.200]   like testosterone or estrogen,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.680]   when we talk about peptides, especially therapeutic peptides,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.280]   oftentimes we're talking about a single peptide
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.960]   that does a bunch of different things
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.900]   depending on the cell type, the time of day or night
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.560]   that that peptide is present,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.320]   and even the different so-called downstream effects
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.200]   of the peptide.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.820]   What do I mean by downstream effects?
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.400]   Well, when a peptide binds to a receptor on a cell surface,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.060]   okay, and you can just think of that process
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.640]   as a little parking spot on the surface of a cell
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.400]   and the peptide, if it's available,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   will bind to that receptor and then set in motion
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.060]   a kind of bucket brigade,
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.080]   a sort of conveyor belt of cellular processes.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.160]   For instance, activating one pathway for cellular growth
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.240]   and another pathway for cell migration,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.600]   for the cell to actually move,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.360]   and maybe another pathway to talk to another cell
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   to stimulate, say, the growth of blood vessels.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.660]   In other words, lots of different or pleiotropic effects.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.520]   This is important because when we're talking
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.240]   about peptide therapeutics, rarely, if ever,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.360]   are we talking about a very targeted
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.760]   and very specific effect of these peptides.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.000]   And this is important both in terms of thinking
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.280]   about what effects you're going to get
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.800]   of taking a given peptide if you decide to do that,
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.560]   as well as potential side effects,
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.200]   as well as things like how to adjust dosage
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.660]   and how long to take a peptide,
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.020]   whether or not to cycle the peptide, et cetera.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.700]   So I just gave you a very simple description
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.420]   of what a peptide is and the fact that they have pleiotropic,
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.720]   meaning many different effects both within cells
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.400]   and across different cell types,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.220]   and of course, across different organ systems.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.520]   So rarely, if ever, will you hear
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   that a peptide does one thing.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.600]   Most often, a peptide does anywhere from four
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.760]   to maybe even 1,000 different things.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.960]   And again, we can go back to our basic examples of peptides
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.880]   like insulin, like oxytocin, and say, for instance,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.600]   oxytocin, it's known to be involved
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.740]   in milk letdown during lactation.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.180]   It's also known to be involved in pair bonding
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.640]   in both males and females,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.440]   as well as pair bonding between parent and child,
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.220]   maybe even parent and pet.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.060]   So the point is that
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.020]   if you want a specific biological effect,
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.000]   maybe you want to repair a given injury,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.040]   or you'd like to get more growth hormone in order,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.440]   I don't know, to get leaner
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.540]   or to recover from exercise more quickly
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.360]   or to feel more vitality.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.040]   Yes, there are peptides that can impact those pathways,
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.640]   but always, always, always, if you take peptides,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.560]   especially therapeutic peptides designed to promote activity
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.080]   within a given pathway for a specific purpose,
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.600]   you are going to activate other pathways as well.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   There's simply no way to remove the pleiotropic feature
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.140]   of peptide therapeutics.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.840]   Nowadays, there's a lot of interest
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.000]   and indeed growing interest in peptide therapeutics.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.280]   And there are really three different paths
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.600]   by which people obtain these peptides.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.000]   The first is by prescription
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.140]   from a board-certified medical doctor.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.920]   So some peptides have been approved for one use,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.560]   but they can be prescribed also for off-label use.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   And here we're talking about FDA-approved,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.000]   clinically-tested peptides.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.800]   But in many cases, they've been clinically tested
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.080]   for one particular area of medicine.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.420]   So for instance, the peptide sermorelin,
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.180]   which promotes the release of growth hormone,
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.580]   has been FDA-approved for the treatment of short stature,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.460]   but it is often now prescribed for other things as well,
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.440]   where a physician and their patient agree
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.640]   that augmenting the growth hormone pathway would be useful.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.440]   Now, regardless of the specific use in mind,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.200]   it's absolutely clear that the safest and best situation,
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.960]   if one is going to use therapeutic peptides,
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.360]   is to use prescription therapeutic peptides,
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.440]   where the prescription comes
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.820]   from a board-certified physician.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.320]   And the reason for that is several fold.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.160]   First of all,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.680]   sometimes these peptides come from pharma companies,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.240]   other times they are made by a compounding pharmacy,
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.360]   but in both situations,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.040]   they are cleaned of what's called lipopolysaccharide, or LPS.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.640]   LPS is something that can accumulate
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.280]   in the manufacturing process of some of these peptides,
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.360]   and it's something that you really want to remove
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.880]   from the peptide before you ingest it or inject it.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.180]   Most peptides are injected,
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.960]   either subcutaneously or into the muscle,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   although some can be taken orally or even a topical cream.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.280]   We'll talk a little bit about different modes of delivery
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.680]   a little bit later.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.840]   In any case, getting the LPS out
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.280]   and making sure that the peptide is pure is very important.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.120]   The reason is that LPS causes an immune response.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.680]   And while a tiny amount of LPS
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.980]   might not cause a massive immune response,
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.880]   the accumulation of many, many LPS exposures
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.560]   can start to become problematic.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.060]   And the other sources of peptides,
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.120]   which are gray market and black market,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.440]   oftentimes do contain the same peptide
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.320]   that one would get from a prescription
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.000]   from a board-certified physician,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.600]   but very often they haven't cleaned out
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.480]   the lipopolysaccharide, they haven't removed the LPS,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.460]   and that can start to create problems over time.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.000]   And of course, in the case of black market sources,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.720]   especially, oftentimes the peptides are not
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.760]   what they claim to be on the label
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.920]   or from a particular source.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.960]   So that's especially problematic.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.420]   So I want to be very clear about my stance on this.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.200]   If you are going to explore peptide therapeutics,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.560]   I highly, highly recommend, indeed, I implore you
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.660]   to do so with a board-certified physician
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.680]   and to acquire peptides through a reliable source
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.560]   where the LPS has been removed,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.240]   which typically means from a pharma company
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.400]   or from a compounding pharmacy.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.240]   Okay, so let's talk about specific peptides
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.800]   for specific purposes.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.280]   Today, we're going to cover four general areas
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.780]   in which peptide therapeutics can be useful.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.520]   The first is for rejuvenation and repair
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.440]   of basically any tissue, but in particular,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.960]   muscle and connective tissue, so sports-type injuries,
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.720]   but also things like gut.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.200]   So for people that suffer from IBS, irritable bowel syndrome,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.540]   or from colitis, or from other gut issues,
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.120]   there is a potential use for therapeutic peptides.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.360]   Then we're going to discuss therapeutic peptides
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.800]   for metabolism and growth of, frankly, all tissues.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.700]   As soon as people hear metabolism and growth,
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.500]   generally, people think of fat loss and muscle growth,
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.240]   and indeed, those fall under this category,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.760]   but there are a bunch of other tissues
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.320]   for which you may want to improve metabolism
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.940]   and perhaps growth as well, so we'll get into that.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.880]   Then we'll discuss therapeutic peptides
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.380]   specifically for longevity, both staving off tumor growth,
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.640]   as well as potentially,
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.880]   and I want to highlight potentially, increasing lifespan,
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.640]   although this is a very experimental area at present.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.880]   And then we'll talk about therapeutic peptides
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.400]   for increasing vitality,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.320]   both mood and libido in both men and women.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.820]   Okay, so let's discuss peptides
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.520]   for rejuvenation and repair of tissues.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.180]   Now, it's pretty common to injure a given tissue,
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.460]   you know, to strain a tendon, or tear a ligament,
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.480]   or break a bone, or I don't know,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.720]   any number of different things.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.440]   This is just kind of part of life.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.520]   If you play sports or if you exercise frequently,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.040]   sooner or later, people tend to get injured.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.200]   And when one does, there's, you know,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.820]   a lot of different things one can do.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.840]   There's a lot of debate nowadays
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.800]   about whether or not you should emphasize cold
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.140]   or whether or not you should emphasize heat.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.400]   There seems to be a growing movement
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.200]   towards emphasizing the use of heat
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.920]   to increase blood flow to a given tissue
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.420]   as opposed to cold.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.080]   We've covered some of this on other podcasts.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.260]   We'll cover it more on future podcasts.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.880]   But, you know, if you happen to injure yourself,
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.480]   typically what your physician will say is rest,
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.120]   maybe do some physical therapy.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.440]   And indeed, those are excellent things to do.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.520]   But one, of course, would ask,
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.760]   is there anything I can take
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.680]   in order to accelerate the healing of a given injury?
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.200]   And for that purpose, a lot of people over the years
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.600]   have explored the use of different peptides,
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.000]   in particular, one that exists within the body naturally
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.960]   and that is involved in wound healing and repair.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.200]   And that peptide is BPC,
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.920]   which stands for Body Protection Compound 157.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.000]   BPC 157 is a synthetic peptide.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.520]   It's manufactured in a laboratory
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.820]   to resemble a peptide that exists naturally within our gut.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.080]   Now, why would we have a naturally occurring peptide,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.520]   a protein within our gut
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.160]   that's involved in wound healing and repair?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.280]   Now, the answer to this isn't entirely clear.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.140]   And as I always say,
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.080]   anytime you want to answer a question
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.200]   about kind of why something evolved to be a particular way,
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.300]   you have to remember that neither I nor anyone else
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.820]   was involved in the design phase.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.960]   It just is what it is.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.440]   So we have to be careful about making up just so stories
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.080]   about why something is doing what it's doing
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.520]   or how it got there.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.380]   So why would there be a peptide within the gut
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.200]   that's involved in tissue healing and repair?
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.640]   Well, in order to understand that,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.080]   it's important to understand that the lining of your gut
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.680]   all along its length
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.700]   involves a bunch of different layers of cells
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.040]   that turn over at a pretty frequent rate.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.720]   So unlike your brain cells,
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.840]   that for instance, after about age 25,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.520]   you're not adding or deleting many brain cells,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.240]   at least provided there's no injury
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.060]   or nerve degenerative disease,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.000]   you're not removing a lot of those brain cells,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.760]   but you're also not adding many brain cells.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.080]   There are a few areas of the brain,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   like the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.760]   or the hippocampus where there is some turnover.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.600]   But for the most part,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.460]   the neurons you have at about age 25
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.660]   are the neurons that you're going to have
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.040]   for the rest of your life.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.100]   Your gut is very different.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.660]   Within the milieu of the gut,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.080]   you have a lot of turnover of cells.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.160]   And the turnover of cells in the gut is in many ways,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.960]   the same sort of turnover process
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.660]   that's involved in wound healing and repair.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.760]   Like if you cut your skin,
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.280]   another tissue or organ in this case,
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.500]   that involves a lot of turnover of cells,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.860]   because as you know, if you cut your skin,
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.060]   at some point it will heal up,
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.220]   first there'll be a scab,
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.020]   then that scab will give way
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.500]   as the tissue underneath it mends.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.500]   And that mending of the tissue
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.060]   is the addition of new skin cells
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.740]   as well as other cell types.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.860]   So the fact that there is a peptide in our gut
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.860]   that can be involved in tissue turnover
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.300]   and tissue turnover is equivalent to tissue repair
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.100]   is not all that surprising.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.140]   Now, it's important to understand
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.660]   that anytime we're discussing tissue rejuvenation,
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.660]   that is cellular turnover or tissue repair,
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.820]   so any kind of wound healing,
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.720]   a small wound or a big wound,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.620]   it almost certainly is going to involve angiogenesis,
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.060]   which is the development of new vascular supply
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.500]   or blood supply.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.240]   Now, of course, vascular supply arrives
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.920]   by capillaries, veins, and arteries.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.860]   And typically when we're talking about angiogenesis
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.200]   in the context of tissue rejuvenation and repair,
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.420]   we're talking about the addition of new capillaries
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.780]   and or blood vessels.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.540]   And that means the addition of new
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.420]   what are called endothelial cells,
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.020]   which are the cells that make up the walls
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.580]   of those blood vessels.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.940]   So put simply, if you want to rejuvenate a tissue
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.060]   or you want to repair a tissue,
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.180]   you need additional blood supply.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.300]   And one of the clear effects of BPC-157
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.620]   is to both encourage cellular turnover
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.960]   as well as cellular migration,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.820]   so new cells and cells moving into a given area,
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.980]   as well as new blood supply
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.400]   through the promotion of this process we call angiogenesis.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.500]   So you can imagine, for instance,
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.860]   that maybe you injure your elbow
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.540]   and you do so in a way that impacts
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.480]   a bunch of different tissues.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.820]   Maybe some of the nerve cells,
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.460]   the neurons there are severed, okay, or crushed.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.200]   So that might lead to some pain there,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.980]   but it might also lead to some inability
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.320]   to move that joint or that limb
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.980]   as well as you could previously.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.860]   Probably also some damage or some crushing
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.620]   to some ligament tissue and some tendon tissue,
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.900]   maybe even to some musculature.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.860]   A bunch of different tissues are impacted.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.180]   And one of the things that BPC-157
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.480]   has been shown to do in animal studies,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.700]   and I really want to emphasize animal studies
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.040]   because that's where the vast, vast, vast majority
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.120]   of data on BPC-157 come from.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.680]   Well, it's been shown to increase blood flow
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.840]   to a given area by virtue of increased angiogenesis.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.560]   So basically to promote the development
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.520]   of new blood vessels to the entire injury site.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.640]   And the way it does that is very interesting.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.640]   BPC-157 somehow is able to recognize injured blood vessels
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.060]   and injured capillaries,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.420]   and then to promote the activity of a given enzyme
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.020]   called ENOS or endothelial nitric oxide synthase,
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.340]   which then causes more blood vasculature to form
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.440]   at the injury site and around the injury site.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.180]   That in turn allows for the delivery, not just of blood,
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.880]   but for the stuff that's contained within blood,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.980]   including growth factors that then promote
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.700]   the further rejuvenation of different cell types
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.540]   in the given area.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.960]   So the things that could potentially lead
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.740]   to repair of muscle, repair of ligament,
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.380]   repair of tendon, et cetera.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.260]   And then BPC-157 is known to further encourage the growth
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.240]   of capillaries and veins within the injury area.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.300]   So it both calls in the development of new vasculature
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.940]   and it promotes the growth of that new vasculature.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.660]   BPC-157 is also known from animal studies
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.840]   to encourage fibroblast migration and growth
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.180]   within a site of injury.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.680]   Fibroblasts are a key cell type within an injury,
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.920]   and they provide some of the really firm, strong substrate
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.580]   for bridging injuries and that allow different things
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.340]   like tendons and ligaments to restore themselves
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.540]   from say torn or partially torn
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.500]   to a complete tendon or ligament.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.080]   Now there's a very long and kind of interesting history
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.760]   of the use of gastric juices.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.260]   Okay, I know the term might make a few people queasy,
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.820]   but gastric juices to promote tissue healing and repair.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.300]   Now there's a whole history of focusing on gastric juices
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.280]   or at least the stomach environment
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.820]   for keeping given tissues alive
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.540]   so that they can be repaired later.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.720]   I know this sounds a bit gruesome,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.920]   but one can find in the historical medical literature
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.580]   instances of people say severing off a finger
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.040]   or even a hand or things of that sort.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.300]   And then it being placed by a surgeon of course,
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.820]   or in some cases, these were battlefield situations
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:57.740]   into the gut as a way to preserve that finger or hand
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.540]   and keep it alive essentially.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.020]   And then to graft it back on
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.660]   or to make an attempt to graft it back on
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.740]   so that the person could then use those fingers
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.860]   or that hand again.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.380]   And while not always successful,
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.180]   it was clear or at least the idea started to form
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.620]   that tissues that were placed inside the milieu of the gut
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.820]   stood a better chance of being grafted back on.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.500]   Now you could think of a number of different factors
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.760]   that could impact the improved grafting
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.740]   of tissues placed in the gut
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.580]   until the graft could take place.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.180]   You know, it could be the heat of the environment.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.260]   It could be the fact that the hand or finger
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.140]   is not exposed to things out in the world.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.860]   So less bacteria, et cetera.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.820]   Nonetheless, physicians were intrigued by the idea
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.700]   that maybe something within the gut itself
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.020]   and in particular within gastric juices
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.540]   were beneficial for preserving
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.460]   and maybe even rejuvenating tissues.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.220]   And one particular peptide compound
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.780]   turned out to be BPC, body protection compound,
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.020]   which again is synthesized as BPC-157.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.700]   So there's a real logic here.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.980]   But what we haven't really addressed is
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.060]   if one has an injury, let's say to the hand
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.020]   or to the arm or to the leg or to the ankle
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.600]   or to the Achilles tendon,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.460]   how is it that body protection compound
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.780]   that normally would exist within the gut
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.220]   actually access that injured tissue?
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.220]   Now, this still remains somewhat of a mystery.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.500]   It is clear that BPC-157 can exit the gut,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   but how it gets traffic to particular sites
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.180]   within the body that are injured still isn't clear.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.260]   That said, within the community of people
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.020]   that use BPC-157 for therapeutic reasons
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.100]   for tissue rejuvenation and repair,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.420]   there's sort of been an ongoing debate
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.160]   as to whether or not you can take it systemically,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.100]   that is to inject it or even take it orally,
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.220]   and that it will find the site of injury, right?
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.980]   It'll direct itself to the site of injury,
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.460]   or whether or not it's more beneficial
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.020]   to inject it directly to the site of injury.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.940]   And here there's really no formal science.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.420]   I want to be really clear.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.460]   When we talk about BPC-157,
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.620]   we can look to a pretty large literature
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.780]   of peer-reviewed studies dating back to about 1993
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.460]   is when the first kind of rigorous study
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.140]   of BPC-157 really began.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.920]   And there are a lot of studies in rats, in mice,
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.740]   in a few other species as well.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.260]   To my knowledge, there is only one study on humans,
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.940]   and it's not a clinical trial.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.020]   And frankly, it's not the best performed study,
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.120]   and that's putting it mildly.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.040]   It's more kind of self-report
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.160]   of people recovering from a given injury,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.860]   whether or not they took BPC-157 or they didn't.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.740]   So when we talk about BPC-157,
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.300]   we're talking about a pretty unusual circumstance
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.400]   whereby many, many people are now taking it,
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.980]   very likely hundreds of thousands,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.060]   perhaps even now into the millions.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.280]   But we actually have essentially no human data
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   as to how BPC-157 works in humans and why it does seem,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.320]   because this seems to be the "anecdota"
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.360]   to accelerate healing of a variety of different injuries.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.080]   Okay, so it's an unusual circumstance,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.320]   and it's kind of an unusual thing
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.520]   for us to talk about here on the podcast.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.820]   Yes, we've talked about supplements,
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.760]   and yes, we've talked about different hormone therapies,
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.940]   and yes, we've talked about any number of different things,
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.360]   but it's pretty unusual to have so much animal literature.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.440]   I even would go so far as to say quality studies
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.120]   of BPC-157 and its effects in animal models,
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.440]   such as rats and mice,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.080]   and such a dearth of formal rigorous exploration
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.620]   of BPC-157 in humans.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.480]   And at the same time, a, gosh, let's just call it what it is,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.380]   a really rich set of "anecdota,"
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.960]   meaning that many, many people,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.280]   perhaps even most people who take BPC-157,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.880]   and by the way, the typical route of taking BPC-157
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.660]   is either to inject it subcutaneously or into the muscle,
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.200]   and to do that, regardless of where the injury is,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.680]   they'll do that in one particular site,
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.920]   so subcutaneously, just a few inches off the belly button,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.440]   or into the shoulder or something of that sort,
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.080]   if they're doing it intramuscularly,
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.760]   or in some cases, people will direct it
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   to the site of injury by injecting more local,
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.560]   like if you have an elbow injury,
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.000]   they'll put it into the muscle right above the elbow
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.020]   or subcutaneously right above the elbow.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.340]   And we're now in a situation where we don't know
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.240]   if we're dealing with pure placebo effect
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.760]   or we are dealing with real effects,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.980]   and so because of the lack of the human clinical studies,
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.240]   we don't know whether or not we're dealing
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.480]   with a situation of robust placebo effects.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.160]   I did an episode all about placebo effects,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.080]   and placebo effects are and can be oh so real.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.380]   They really can really trick you into thinking
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.040]   that a given compound is doing something
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.920]   when in fact it's not doing anything different
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.840]   than would an injection of saline, of salt water,
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.740]   but in this case, there's just such an overwhelming amount
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.080]   of what I call "anecdota,"
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.940]   and there are so many people using BPC-157 now
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.120]   and are interested in starting to use BPC-157
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.640]   that I'd be remiss if I didn't discuss it
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.560]   despite this gap in the human clinical literature.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.640]   So what do we know from the anecdota?
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.200]   The anecdota seem to indicate that the mode of delivery,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.840]   that is whether or not systemic or local,
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   doesn't seem to matter that much,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.920]   although some people, for whatever reason,
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.840]   will purport that local injections serve recovery
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.420]   of the tissue more readily than systemic injections.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.600]   Now, there are a couple things to understand
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.720]   about BPC-157 besides the fact that in animal studies,
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.640]   it's been shown to increase fibroblast migration
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.200]   to a site of injury as well as endothelial cell
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.360]   and vascular growth to a site of injury.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.480]   And the first thing is that injury seems to be important.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.000]   There does seem to be something that the injury signals
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.680]   to BPC-157 to create new vasculature
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.540]   and fibroblast growth there at the site of injury.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.540]   There's no evidence from these animal studies,
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.880]   at least to my knowledge,
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.760]   that BPC-157 systemically increases vascular growth,
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.560]   although one could imagine that it might, right?
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.720]   And for that reason,
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.480]   I'll talk about some cautionary notes about BPC-157
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.680]   as it relates to tumor growth and cancers and diseases,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.000]   in particular of the eye,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.480]   that involve overgrowth of vasculature.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.320]   But before I do that,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.520]   I want to talk a little bit about the safety of BPC-157.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   One of the reasons why it's being used so extensively
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.320]   is that it does seem to have very high safety profiles,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   at least with respect to the lethal dosing, right?
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.760]   In order to find out the lethal dose of something,
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.840]   as you can imagine,
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.360]   unfortunately, the way these studies are done
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.240]   is they give animals more and more,
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.320]   that is higher and higher doses of a given compound,
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.200]   find out at what point about 50% of the population
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.360]   of those animals starts to die,
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.120]   and then that's the so-called LD50,
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.720]   or at least that's one crude way of describing it.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   The LD50 of BPC-157 is incredibly high, okay?
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.740]   It is as high as two grams, okay?
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.960]   Two grams, 2,000 milligrams, that is,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.600]   per kilogram of body weight.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.480]   Now, that does not mean, please hear me on this,
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.920]   that does not mean that anyone should be taking
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.840]   high dosages of BPC-157.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.240]   The typical therapeutic doses that are prescribed
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.820]   are anywhere from 300 to 500 micrograms subcutaneously,
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.100]   maybe two or three times per week.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.160]   And that is typically done for a course of about eight weeks
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.880]   and then people typically cycle off
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   for anywhere from eight to 10 weeks.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.400]   Now, when I say typically, I mean typically,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.440]   because there are individuals
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.700]   that take BPC-157 consistently.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.840]   They just take it every day
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.400]   and they'll just take it indefinitely without any breaks.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.920]   I think that is a bad idea.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.840]   And I want to also state that I am not suggesting anyone
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.880]   run out and take BPC-157.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.320]   Today's episode is really about giving you information
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.720]   so that you can make the determination
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.240]   whether or not you even want to take BPC-157
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.080]   or another peptide.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   And of course, to really seriously consider
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.700]   the sourcing issue that we talked about earlier.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.160]   Now, what would be a reason to avoid taking BPC-157?
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.040]   Well, the first relates to something
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.720]   that many people take BPC-157 for
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.960]   because they believe it's good for them.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.720]   And in some cases, potentially could be,
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.200]   which is that in addition to increasing fibroblast migration
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.720]   and angiogenesis, blood vessel development
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.600]   within a site of injury,
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.420]   BPC-157 is known to have a small,
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.280]   but nonetheless meaningful impact
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.340]   on upregulating growth hormone receptors.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.760]   Now, this can be a good thing
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.000]   if you're trying to upregulate growth hormone receptors
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.840]   at a given injury site so that growth hormone,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.280]   which comes from the pituitary,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.200]   and then we'll talk a bit about more later,
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   then can have a heightened level of action at that tissue
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.160]   and growth hormone is involved in tissue turnover and repair.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.680]   This is evident from childhood
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.960]   where kids heal from wounds much faster
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.840]   than adults heal from wounds.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.480]   There's other reasons why kids heal from wounds
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.320]   more quickly than adults that relate to things
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.620]   like stuff for secreted from the thymus, et cetera.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.980]   We'll talk about that as well.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.720]   But this idea of increasing growth hormone receptors
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.140]   at the site of injury or around the site of injury
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.920]   by injecting BPC-157 locally to the injury
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.320]   or even taking it systemically
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.280]   is one thing that many people think of as advantageous
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.920]   and that's why they want to take BPC-157.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.080]   However, for some people,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.400]   perhaps people who have a tumor in a given area,
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.960]   an increase in growth hormone receptors
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.160]   in and around the tumor
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.440]   could potentially increase the growth of the tumor.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.200]   And that's one of the major issues with BPC-157
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.600]   that's not often discussed,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.920]   which is that if you have a tumor
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.320]   and tumors thrive on increased blood flow
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.580]   because they like to consume growth factors
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.960]   and increased blood flow means increased growth factors
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.580]   and other things that can not just sustain,
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.060]   but actually grow the tumor.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.920]   Well, then by taking BPC-157,
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.740]   you may be either maintaining
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.460]   or accelerating the growth of a tumor
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.740]   that would otherwise be removed or stay small.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.000]   In other words, BPC-157 is a potential tumor growth risk.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.600]   So if you have knowledge of a given cancer
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.960]   or you're concerned about tumors at all,
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.600]   I would encourage you to be very cautious
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.560]   about the use of BPC-157.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.960]   In fact, one way that BPC-157
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.160]   creates this increase in angiogenesis,
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.080]   this increase in vasculature
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.440]   is through upregulation of something called VEGF,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.680]   V-E-G-F, which is vascular endothelial growth factor.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.400]   Now, there is a common treatment for cancers,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.760]   which is Avastin.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.280]   Avastin is a VEGF inhibitor.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.680]   It's a drug that's designed to fight tumors,
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.240]   to reduce tumor size,
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.520]   and does so by inhibiting VEGF.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.400]   Whereas BPC-157 is doing the exact opposite.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.780]   It is increasing levels of VEGF to increase angiogenesis.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.960]   So by logical extension,
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.640]   if you're concerned about tumors or cancer of any kind,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.240]   BPC-157 is probably not something that you want to explore.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.460]   So if BPC-157 carries these risks,
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.860]   why are so many people interested in taking it
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.200]   or taking it?
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.080]   I think in large part,
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.880]   that's due to the fact that the anecdote about BPC-157
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.640]   is just so strong.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.400]   People report all sorts of things,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.280]   like they recovered from their shoulder injury much faster.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.720]   There are these kind of outrageous claims
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.880]   about people recovering from complete tissue transections.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.640]   And indeed there, the animal data are pretty impressive.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.480]   I went into the data
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.560]   that looked at sciatic nerve regrowth after injury,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.960]   Achilles tendon regrowth after injury.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.320]   And some of these studies in rats
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.000]   involved a complete transection,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.540]   not just a partial tear,
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.860]   but a complete cut of a given ligament or tendon
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.780]   or nerve pathway.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.980]   And indeed the data are pretty impressive
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.460]   that when BPC-157 is applied systemically, right?
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.340]   So given, you know, at the level of the gut,
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.180]   somehow it's able to travel to the site of injury,
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.340]   recognize that something needs to be done there
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.460]   in particular angiogenesis and fibroblast infiltration.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.100]   And it does seem that on average
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.140]   that these tissues repair faster
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.940]   than they do if BPC-157 is not provided.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.000]   But again, the tumor concerns and the lack of human data
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.460]   are a real concern that everyone should be made aware of.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.700]   I do not think that BPC-157
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.340]   is not without its quote unquote side effects.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.500]   I do think that we are now in a state
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.800]   of widespread experimental use of BPC-157,
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.580]   even though it can be obtained clean without LPS
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.880]   from compounding pharmacies and by prescription.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.240]   There are a lot of people taking BPC-157.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.700]   And I just want to return to the point I made earlier,
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.020]   which is that, you know,
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.660]   BPC-157 is typically taken in these dosages
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.020]   of about 300 to 500 micrograms, you know,
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.220]   two to three times per week, maybe even five days per week.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.580]   If you're going to go down this path of taking BPC-157,
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.740]   I would encourage you to take the minimal effective dose,
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.060]   to not just simply do it every day,
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.660]   and certainly to not do it continuously.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.300]   And of course, to monitor your other health metrics
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.600]   for anything that could potentially resemble cancer
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.460]   or tumor growth.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.860]   Because obviously stimulating angiogenesis for wound repair
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.900]   sounds like a great thing,
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.520]   recovering and being able to do your workouts
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.220]   or play your sport or move about more comfortably,
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.700]   of course, a wonderfully attractive thing to do.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.940]   Isn't that what we all want?
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.960]   But obviously not with the trade-off of growing a tumor
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.100]   or developing a cancer or accelerating a cancer.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.480]   I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.460]   and thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.060]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.360]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.480]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.740]   The reason I started taking it
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.540]   and the reason I still take it every day
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.920]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.720]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.560]   And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.080]   to support gut health.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.540]   Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.200]   we realized is not just important for the health of our gut,
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.360]   but also for our immune system
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.520]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.080]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.040]   In other words, gut health is critical
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.920]   for proper brain functioning.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.600]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.020]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.980]   but there are a number of things in AG1
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.660]   including specific micronutrients
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.220]   that are hard to get from whole foods
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.100]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.540]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.300]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.320]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.860]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.020]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.140]   what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.460]   because AG1 supports so many different systems
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.660]   within the body that are involved in mental health,
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.240]   physical health and performance.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.120]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.280]   and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.360]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.120]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.160]   Okay, so we're still talking about peptides
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.040]   for tissue rejuvenation and repair.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.560]   And we spent quite a bit of time on BPC-157
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.120]   because that's one getting a lot of attention nowadays.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.560]   There's another one that's getting increasing attention
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.080]   that's worth mentioning, which is thymosin beta-4
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.060]   and a related peptide, which is TB-500,
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.060]   which is basically a truncated or a shortened version
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.020]   of the thymosin beta-4 peptide.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.160]   Remember the peptide are these strings of amino acids
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.520]   like beads on a string.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.560]   And thymosin beta-4 is something
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.100]   that the body produces naturally
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.500]   from this thing called the thymus,
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.160]   which is present in children
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.560]   and then disappears as we get older.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.500]   And it's well-known, again, this is correlative,
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.800]   but it's well-known that children recover more quickly
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.520]   from injuries and indeed the degree of tissue regrowth
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.000]   and the repair of wounds with minimal scarring
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.160]   is so much greater in young children
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.600]   and in children than it is in adults.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.160]   And this is what gave rise to the idea
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.660]   that perhaps some of the peptides
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.240]   that are secreted from the thymus,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.960]   such as thymosin beta-4,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.120]   could be involved in tissue rejuvenation and repair.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.480]   And that's what led to the laboratory synthesis
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.760]   of thymosin beta-4, the full-length peptide
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.640]   made in a lab, not by the thymus,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.920]   and then adults take it, okay?
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.360]   Or TB500, which is this truncated,
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.320]   slightly shortened version of thymosin beta-4,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.040]   which acts similarly to thymosin beta-4,
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.600]   but has a kind of different mode of action,
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.700]   lasts a little bit longer, et cetera.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.960]   Now, again, we're in a situation
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.460]   where there are vast amounts of animal data,
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.020]   studies on mice or rats typically,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.700]   that show that thymosin beta-4
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.480]   can increase the rate and/or thoroughness
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.520]   of wound healing and repair.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.900]   But again, there are more and more people
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.900]   now taking thymosin beta-4
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.640]   for the purposes of tissue rejuvenation and repair
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.040]   and report positive effects.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.280]   Now, when we say positive effects,
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.520]   we have to stand back and say,
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.560]   well, what's the control experiment?
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.360]   How would they know how quickly they would heal
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.000]   without the thymosin beta-4?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.280]   And there's simply no way to address that question.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.040]   My whole purpose in doing this episode
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.860]   is to highlight how these different molecules
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.400]   ought to work, how they've been shown
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.600]   to work in animal models,
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.040]   and therefore how they might be working in humans.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.440]   But again, in the absence of clinical trials,
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.920]   we still don't know if and how they are working in humans.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.260]   Nonetheless, a lot of people are now starting to take,
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.600]   especially TB-500.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   It's often taken in combination with BPC-157.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.080]   And at the level of mechanism,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.400]   the difference between BPC-157 and thymosin beta-4
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.280]   is that thymosin beta-4 really promotes the growth
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.760]   and infiltration of all sorts of different cell types
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.880]   associated with tissue rejuvenation
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.720]   and especially wound healing and repair.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.640]   It's been shown to promote stem cell proliferation.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.400]   It's been shown to increase the growth
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.080]   of the so-called extracellular matrix,
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.200]   the stuff around the cells
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.520]   that keeps the area around the cells kind of rigid
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.280]   so that the tissue or the organ has more stability, right?
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.440]   You can't just have a bunch of cells
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.520]   with a bunch of empty space around them
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.540]   where they can move about.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.820]   You want to have some rigidity to the whole thing.
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.640]   So the idea is that thymosin beta-4
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.920]   is promoting the aggregation of a bunch of things
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.080]   associated with tissue healing.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.440]   I've noticed out there that a lot of people
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.480]   talk about TB-500, that is thymosin beta-4,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.680]   in the context of being growth-promoting.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.600]   As far as I know, it isn't growth-promoting.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.520]   It doesn't impact the growth hormone pathway
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.580]   or other pathways associated with tissue growth.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.900]   Rather, it's involved in tissue repair.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.800]   So what I just discussed are the two major players
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.020]   or the two most often used peptides nowadays
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.960]   for tissue rejuvenation and repair.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.680]   We've got BPC-157, which you can just basically
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.800]   frame up in your mind as promoting angiogenesis
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.980]   and wound repair through a variety of mechanisms,
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.200]   but mainly the addition of new vasculature to the wound site.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.000]   And then we've got thymosin beta-4,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.560]   which is sometimes referred to as TB-500,
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.920]   which is just a shorter synthesized version
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.240]   of thymosin beta-4, which is a molecule
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.880]   known to come from the thymosin children.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.600]   Whether or not it's solely responsible,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.760]   I doubt it's solely responsible, in fact,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.200]   for the better tissue healing and repair
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.340]   seen in children as opposed to adults, we don't know.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.080]   And yet it does seem, at least anecdotally,
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.520]   that people are taking TB-500, again,
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.240]   either alone or in combination with BPC-157,
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.400]   and at least to their mind, are reporting more thorough
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.360]   or more rapid tissue rejuvenation and repair.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.260]   So the next category of peptide effects
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.440]   that I'd like to talk about are the effects
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.160]   of certain peptides on metabolism and growth.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.740]   And any discussion about metabolism and growth,
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.740]   by definition, has to include a discussion
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.760]   about growth hormones.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.940]   So basically where we're headed is a discussion
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.120]   about peptides that can increase amounts of growth hormone
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.160]   that are released in our brain and body
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.600]   to have specific effects,
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.160]   in particular, increases in metabolism
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.400]   and increases in either muscle growth,
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.600]   and in some cases, repair of tissues as well,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.940]   although mainly muscle growth and fat loss.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.780]   For those of you that aren't familiar with growth hormone,
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.160]   growth hormone is a hormone that we naturally make.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.720]   It's secreted from a gland called the pituitary gland.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.400]   The pituitary sits near the roof of the mouth,
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.760]   and it extends out of the stalk of the brain
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.080]   such that it can release hormones
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.960]   into the general bloodstream.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.000]   The pituitary is connected to the brain, however,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.780]   so it can get input from a brain area
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.160]   called the hypothalamus, and within the hypothalamus,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.040]   there are neurons that can send signals to the pituitary,
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.120]   telling it to either release growth hormone
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.620]   or to suppress the release of growth hormone.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.200]   Now, early in life, when we are infants, children,
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.920]   teenagers, and so on, we secrete tons of growth hormone,
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.460]   in particular, during the early hours of sleep each night.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.120]   We also secrete growth hormone a little bit
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.160]   throughout the day, but it's really in sleep
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.660]   in which we have the greatest degree
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.840]   of growth hormone release.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.320]   This is one reason why babies and kids and teenagers
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.560]   sleep so much is there's a lot of growth hormone release,
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.320]   and we tend to grow, that is the tissues and limbs
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.160]   of our body tend to grow during sleep.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.080]   Now, it's been well-documented that after about age 30,
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.120]   which is typically when people experience
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.720]   their full stature, their full height,
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.960]   although sometimes there's a little bit
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.760]   of wiggle room around that age, typically after 30,
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.480]   the amount of growth hormone that's released each night
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.360]   and throughout the day is reduced by about 15%
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.140]   for every decade of life.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.720]   As a consequence, all of the things that growth hormone does
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.640]   like encouraging higher metabolism, fat loss,
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.960]   the growth of muscle tissue, et cetera,
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.000]   is dramatically reduced as we go from 30 to 40 to 50
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.240]   and on and on.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.100]   It's also the case that naturally released growth hormone
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.480]   tends to have positive effects on our mood
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.880]   and overall feelings of wellbeing.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.200]   So it's also tied to our feelings of vitality
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.320]   or having feelings of energy to do things.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.680]   And that's because growth hormone
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.180]   potently increases ATP production,
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.320]   which is involved in energy and metabolism in our cells.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.920]   And as a consequence, our overall feelings of energy
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.320]   to just do things mental or physical.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.480]   Now there's another hormone called IGF-1
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.320]   or insulin growth factor one,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.960]   which is produced by the liver.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.400]   Insulin growth factor one does many things
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.920]   similar to growth hormone,
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.940]   and it actually is released in response to growth hormone.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.280]   So basically the way this works
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.880]   is that there's a signal that comes from the hypothalamus
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.640]   called growth hormone releasing hormone.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   And then that signal stimulates the anterior pituitary
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.240]   to release growth hormone.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.700]   Growth hormone then is circulated throughout the blood.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.240]   It also can access the brain itself.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.840]   And it does different things in different tissues,
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.520]   but again, increases ATP production for energy.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.360]   It is going to cause tissue repair in some cases.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.560]   It's also going to encourage growth of tissues,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.440]   not just muscles, but other tissues.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.960]   And that's why it's involved in helping us
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.360]   achieve our full height, our full stature.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.920]   When growth hormone reaches the liver,
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.160]   it stimulates the release of IGF-1,
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.080]   which in turn does a number of things
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.300]   that are both synergistic and different.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.840]   That is, it works both similarly to growth hormone
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.940]   and does some things in parallel
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.480]   that are a little bit different as well.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.860]   In particular, things related to regulation
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.960]   of blood sugar metabolism, et cetera.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.120]   All things associated with kind of youthfulness,
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.700]   vitality, and energy.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.680]   So it's impossible for me to say that growth hormone
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.960]   and IGF-1 do just one thing each.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.120]   They do lots of different things
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.680]   in lots of different tissues.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.420]   But hopefully from the description I just gave,
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.080]   you could see why some people might be interested
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.220]   in augmenting or increasing levels of growth hormone.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.660]   Now, growth hormone has been sequenced and synthesized.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.520]   So you can buy a synthetic version of growth hormone.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.280]   And indeed, some people will take
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.520]   prescription growth hormone.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.040]   They'll take this by, typically it's an injection
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.120]   that's given subcutaneously at night
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.600]   and they achieve growth of tissues,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.080]   including muscle, et cetera.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.800]   Keep in mind that growth hormone is indiscriminate
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.640]   with respect to which tissues it grows.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.160]   So if you happen to have an existing tumor
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.660]   on a given body part or within a given body part,
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.540]   it will encourage growth of that tumor as well.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.340]   That's one of the reasons some people are cautious
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.120]   about taking growth hormone.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.440]   Another reason why many people are cautious
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.860]   about taking growth hormone is that it is subject
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.820]   to what's called negative feedback.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.140]   If your blood levels of growth hormone are too high
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.500]   by virtue of injecting growth hormone,
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.380]   well, then the pituitary can register that
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.700]   and the brain can register that.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.920]   And then there's a negative feedback
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.980]   that shuts down growth hormone.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.860]   As a consequence, people have developed peptide therapeutics
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.940]   that stimulate the release of growth hormone
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.100]   and thereby the release of IGF-1,
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.500]   but not by directly stimulating the growth hormone pathway.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.020]   Typically what these peptides are,
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.620]   are these are peptides that mimic the sorts of things
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.980]   that are typically released from the hypothalamus
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.300]   onto the pituitary and in that way,
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.260]   stimulate the release of growth hormone and downstream IGF-1.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.220]   So what these things are typically called are secretagogues.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.940]   These are peptide molecules that have been synthesized
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.580]   in a laboratory that stimulate the release of growth hormone
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.540]   and thereby stimulate the production of IGF-1.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.100]   Now there are two general categories of peptides
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.980]   for stimulating the release of growth hormone.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.780]   The first category oftentimes are referred to
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.940]   as the GHRH peptides,
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.920]   for growth hormone releasing hormone peptides.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.980]   Now that name has certain problems
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.280]   that we'll get to in a moment,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.380]   but let's just leave it there for the time being.
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.080]   The second category are what's called
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.680]   the growth hormone releasing peptides, right?
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.800]   Before we said growth hormone releasing hormones,
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.180]   that's the first category.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.060]   Second ones are the growth hormone releasing peptides.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.460]   You can already tell why this is getting confusing.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.020]   Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.860]   Rather than use that nomenclature,
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.140]   which is the typical nomenclature that's used,
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.980]   and I must say for which there's a lot of errors
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.020]   when I look out there on various YouTube videos
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.340]   and I look within even some of the reviews
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.340]   that have been written,
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.460]   people get things confused as to whether or not
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.580]   a given peptide that one would use as a therapeutic
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.220]   falls into one or the other category.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.060]   And you'll see in a minute,
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.780]   it's a really important distinction.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.380]   Instead, what I'm going to call these
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:04.100]   are category one peptides and category two peptides, okay?
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.020]   In general, category one peptides
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.160]   are going to be the ones
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.700]   that have been most thoroughly tested in humans.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.920]   In some cases, in fact, in several cases,
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.260]   are FDA approved for certain conditions,
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.940]   and yes, are prescribed for other off-label effects.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.340]   Again, this would be under what I'm calling
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:25.100]   type one growth hormone secreting peptides is sermorelin.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.700]   Sermorelin is a synthetic compound
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.940]   designed to mimic naturally occurring
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.340]   growth hormone releasing hormone
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:36.100]   that is FDA approved for the treatment of short stature.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.500]   So you can get this by prescription.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.580]   Sometimes it comes from a compounding pharmacy.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.700]   Other times it comes directly from Pharma
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.060]   for the name brand.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.220]   In any case, sermorelin has been shown to mimic
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.220]   what is normally released from the hypothalamus
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.220]   and stimulates the pituitary to release growth hormone.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.240]   And it does indeed cause increases
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.300]   in circulating growth hormone and increases in IGF-1.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.220]   By the way, the typical dosages of sermorelin
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.220]   that are taken are anywhere from 200 to 400 micrograms.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.920]   Typically that's done at night before sleep
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.940]   for the reasons that we talked about before.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.940]   And typically people will take it anywhere
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.640]   from three times per week or five times per week.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.380]   There are some disadvantages to taking it continuously
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.220]   seven days per week for long periods of time.
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.020]   There's some desensitization that can occur.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.420]   Not much, but some can occur.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.460]   So taken in that way,
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.260]   sermorelin has been shown to increase
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.460]   circulating levels of growth hormone and IGF-1.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.140]   And the reason why a lot of people seek to take sermorelin
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.340]   is because they like the effects it produces.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.340]   They like the vitality.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.340]   They like the muscle growth.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.900]   They like the fat loss.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.220]   It also can increase the amount of deep sleep that you get.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.740]   I'll just be completely forthcoming.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.460]   I've taken sermorelin on and off
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.180]   for the last couple of years.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.600]   I typically will take it anywhere
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.260]   from one to two nights per week.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.700]   And I stopped taking it almost completely.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.020]   I'll still take it every once in a great while.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.580]   But the reason I stopped taking it
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.660]   is that I noticed that it made the sleep
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.120]   in the early part of my night very, very deep, very robust.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.700]   But then I would wake up wide awake
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.300]   or I would sleep till morning.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.460]   And then at least according to my eight sleep sleep tracker
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.300]   or my whoop sleep tracker,
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.400]   I wasn't getting nearly as much rapid eye movement sleep
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.580]   as I normally would.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.600]   So at least in my case, and again, this is anecdata,
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.740]   it seemed to sort of replace rapid eye movement sleep
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.940]   with more deep sleep.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.140]   And rapid eye movement sleep is critical
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.980]   for all sorts of things that deep sleep can't achieve
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:24.940]   and vice versa.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.160]   So you really want both.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.980]   So this is one reason why I've basically
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.140]   stopped taking sermorelin.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.600]   I'll occasionally take it every once in a while.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.700]   But in general, I just stopped taking it
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.180]   because whatever the positive effects might've been
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.780]   if I had taken it more consistently,
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.180]   the effects in depleting rapid eye movement sleep
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.540]   were just something I didn't want and don't want.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.260]   And by the way, that effect on increasing deep sleep,
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.500]   that non-REM sleep is something
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.940]   that's pretty well-documented.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.100]   The other, what I'm calling type one,
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.220]   growth hormone-promoting peptide is tesomerelin.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.460]   This goes by the brand name Agrifta,
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.640]   and it's an FDA-approved drug for the reduction
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.460]   of visceral adiposity in HIV patients.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.000]   So we have subcutaneous fat,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.940]   and we have visceral fat around our organs.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.280]   Visceral fat can be really problematic.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.460]   And for some people who have HIV,
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.080]   or even for people who don't have HIV,
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.660]   the deposits of visceral fat can be problematic
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.680]   for their health.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.720]   And tesomerelin, again, also called Agrifta,
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.360]   has been shown to reduce visceral adiposity.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.740]   It also seems to produce some of the other same effects
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.080]   that sermorelin produces.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.400]   The differences between the two relate to small differences
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.800]   in the amino acid sequence for one peptide versus the other.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.760]   Tesomerelin is a bit more long-lasting than sermorelin,
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.080]   and therefore is taken typically about three times per week,
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.720]   not five times per week.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.220]   Now, the third most commonly used peptide in this category
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.640]   of what I'm calling type one,
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:47.000]   growth hormone-secreting peptides is CJC1295.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.760]   Gosh, I wish there was an easier name.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.840]   CJC1295 is basically a variant
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.380]   of a different growth hormone-secreting peptide
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:57.920]   that was synthesized previously,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.600]   to which they add what's called a DAC,
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.080]   a drug affinity complex.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.240]   It's a sequence that makes it very long-lasting.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.880]   So CJC1295 typically is only taken twice per week,
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.080]   or even once per week,
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.320]   because its effects on increasing growth hormone
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.240]   in IGF-1 last several days,
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.360]   which may sound great to you,
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.800]   especially if you're somebody that doesn't like
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.200]   taking injections, because these things in general
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.860]   have to be delivered by injection.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.780]   But keep in mind that CJC1295 has entered clinical trials.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.440]   There was a death within one of the clinical trials
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.340]   that was related to cardiovascular dysfunction.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.640]   It's known to cause some fluid retention
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.780]   and increased fluid volume,
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.280]   which may have been related to that cardiovascular death.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.320]   We don't know, okay?
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   This is all kind of speculation.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.760]   But I would say if you are somebody considering
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.500]   using a growth hormone-secreting peptide,
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:49.880]   the type one category is perhaps,
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.280]   and I'll give my explanation
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.920]   for why I believe this to be the case,
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.240]   perhaps the most advantageous category to explore.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.500]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.840]   you've got the options of sermorelin and tesamorelin,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.120]   both of which are FDA approved,
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.400]   and for which there's both animal and human data.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.180]   CJC1295, despite still being in clinical trials,
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.800]   does have this kind of stain of a death
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.200]   within the clinical trial.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.760]   And to my mind, given that there are decent alternatives
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.540]   in sermorelin or tesamorelin,
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.540]   I don't know why anyone would specifically select CJC1295
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.360]   until all these safety issues have been resolved.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.500]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.120]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Element.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.560]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.680]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.000]   That means zero sugar
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.400]   and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes,
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.680]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.480]   And that correct ratio of electrolytes
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.600]   is extremely important because every cell in your body,
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.900]   but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.960]   relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.480]   So when you're well hydrated
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.760]   and you have the appropriate amount
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.120]   of electrolytes in your system,
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.200]   your mental functioning
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.280]   and your physical functioning is improved.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.120]   I drink one packet of Element dissolved
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.520]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.080]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.040]   as well as while I exercise.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.120]   And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.600]   I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.580]   in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:09.760]   Element comes in a variety of different flavors,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.680]   all of which I find really tasty.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.360]   I like the citrus, I like the watermelon,
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.440]   I like the raspberry.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.280]   Frankly, I can't pick just one.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.360]   It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint,
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.600]   which I find tastes best
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.640]   if they are put into water, dissolved, and then heated up.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.080]   I tend to do that in the winter months
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.560]   because, of course, you don't just need hydration
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.120]   on hot days and in the summer and spring months,
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.200]   but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.220]   and the environment tends to be dry.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.360]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.760]   you can go to drinkelement,
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.640]   spelled L-E-M-E-N-T dot com slash Huberman,
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.880]   to try a free sample pack.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.400]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.640]   Okay, so there are definitely other synthetic growth hormone
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.000]   releasing hormone peptides that are out there,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.720]   but I think these three that we've covered,
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.480]   Sermorellin, Tesomerellin, and CJC1295,
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.160]   account for the vast majority
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.920]   of those that I'd put into category one.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.600]   The other category, which I'm going to call category two,
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.240]   you'll also hear a lot about,
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.240]   and they operate a little bit differently.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.040]   These peptides encourage the release of growth hormone,
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.880]   but they do so either by mimicking
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.700]   or stimulating the release of another peptide
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.800]   called ghrelin.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.520]   Some of you may be familiar with ghrelin
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.960]   because ghrelin is a peptide
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.380]   that increases in concentration when we are hungry.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.920]   So it stimulates hunger,
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.120]   and it also stimulates anxiety somewhat.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.520]   So you may be wondering why would anyone
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.040]   want to increase levels of growth hormone and ghrelin?
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.640]   And the reason is that the ghrelin itself
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.000]   can impact the growth hormone pathway pretty potently.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.880]   So you can get really robust increases in growth hormone,
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.900]   but because there are ghrelin increases as well,
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:42.080]   you get big increases in hunger and anxiety in some people
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.440]   and lesser in others.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.880]   Now, the different names of the peptides
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.440]   in this type two category
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.360]   are ones that you'll hear kicked around a lot these days,
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.680]   things like ipamirillin.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.760]   Okay, so don't get ipamirillin confused with tesamirillin.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.880]   Right, tesamirillin is a type one
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.800]   growth hormone releasing hormone peptide.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.280]   Ipamirillin is in this category two.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   So it's definitely going to increase ghrelin,
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.420]   which is going to increase hunger.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.040]   It does have certain advantages,
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.700]   in particular that it increases growth hormone release
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:08.800]   by two mechanisms.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.720]   It increases it directly,
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.600]   and it tends to suppress something called somatostatin.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.360]   Somatostatin is a bit of a break or an antagonist
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.100]   on growth hormone release.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.980]   So with ipamirillin, you're essentially removing the break
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.020]   on growth hormone release,
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:23.960]   allowing more growth hormone to be released
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.120]   such that you get a lot of growth hormone released.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.080]   It also tends to really improve sleep.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.640]   But again, by increasing the amount of deep sleep,
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.680]   we don't know whether or not it does that
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.180]   at the expense of rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.580]   So ipamirillin is the most commonly discussed one
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.440]   in this type two category.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.540]   The other one that you'll hear about is called hexarellin.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.720]   Hexarellin is available by prescription,
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.440]   and it is the strongest stimulator
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.560]   of growth hormone release,
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.560]   which leads many people to think,
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.600]   "Okay, I want hexarellin.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.860]   That's the one that's going to give me
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.680]   the biggest growth hormone pulse."
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.260]   And indeed the growth hormone pulses from hexarellin
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.600]   can be as great as two or three times more
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.120]   than with the other growth hormone secreting peptides
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.160]   that we've talked about.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.280]   However, we know that hexarellin
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.140]   can also dramatically increase prolactin,
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.480]   which can cause suppression of libido.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.800]   It can cause fluid retention.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.920]   It can cause a kind of feeling of malaise,
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.480]   especially at high levels.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.120]   And perhaps most problematically,
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.600]   hexarellin can desensitize the receptors
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.760]   for growth hormone-releasing hormone,
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.320]   such that your system will no longer respond
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.000]   either to the hexarellin or to any other peptide,
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.720]   or perhaps most importantly, to any endogenous,
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.520]   that is naturally made growth hormone, excuse me,
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.680]   releasing hormone that you would make, okay?
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.080]   So that's something to really consider.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.460]   If you're going to explore hexarellin,
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.220]   make sure, please, that you're working with a physician.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.860]   Make sure that you're not taking too much of it
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:44.160]   or for too long, and keep an eye on those prolactin levels
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.980]   because those can be problematic if they get too high.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.940]   And, you know, by my read,
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.580]   I can't see why anyone would use high doses of hexarellin,
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.300]   maybe low doses of hexarellin,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.340]   if your doctor thinks that's what's appropriate for you,
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.620]   but you'd really want to avoid that receptor desensitization
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.460]   because you could essentially
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.420]   turn off the system permanently.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:02.340]   Now, there are a bunch of other,
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:06.940]   what I'm calling type two growth hormone promoting peptides.
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.540]   These include GHRP-2, GHRP-3, GHRP-6.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.400]   Again, different amino acid sequences,
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.940]   all designed to achieve the same thing,
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.300]   which is more growth hormone.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:20.140]   Things like GHRP-3 can potently increase growth hormone,
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.780]   but are known to also potently increase prolactin
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.300]   and cortisol, leading to more than a doubling
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.840]   of circulating cortisol,
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.620]   which, depending on how well-regulated it is
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.000]   across the time of day, can be problematic.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.460]   In other words, you want cortisol levels pretty high
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.340]   in the early part of the day,
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.780]   but you want them very, very low
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:38.380]   in the later part of the day and at night.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.420]   And keep in mind that almost always,
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:41.940]   these growth hormone peptides,
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.680]   whether or not they're type one or type two peptides,
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.540]   are taken before bed,
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:50.460]   typically, you know, 20 or 30 minutes before sleep.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.140]   Always, it's suggested that they be taken
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.860]   at least an hour and a half after eating any food
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.420]   and that you don't eat for at least 30 minutes afterwards,
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.980]   because if you happen to have elevated blood sugar
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.120]   or you've got food in your gut,
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.640]   they're not going to have as potent an effect
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.760]   at increasing growth hormone and IGF-1.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.560]   So again, you want to avoid food in the hour and a half,
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.280]   probably two hours before taking them,
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.320]   and certainly in the half hour or longer after,
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.960]   which is why most people take them right before going
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   to sleep and add or augment that big growth hormone pulse
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.280]   that occurs in the early part of the night.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.760]   And then many people have perhaps heard
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.080]   of what's called MK-677,
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.600]   which is simply an oral version, a non-injectable,
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.280]   but oral version of these GHRPs.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.460]   And it tends to have the same issues
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:37.340]   that the other GHRPs have, which are elevated cortisol,
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.740]   and in some cases, elevated prolactin as well.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.140]   Okay, so if we just kind of zoom out from all this,
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.140]   we can say that yes, indeed, there are synthetic peptides
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.700]   that can potently increase growth hormone and IGF-1.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:51.540]   I explained the rationale for why people would want that
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.380]   or perhaps to explore that.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.900]   I'm certainly not suggesting anyone do this.
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.260]   Again, I am suggesting that if you do explore it,
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.360]   you work with a board-certified physician
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.920]   and that you get these compounds
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.720]   from a quality compounding pharmacy
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.320]   or by their name brand prescription.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.980]   In type one, we've got sermorelin and tesamorelin.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.360]   Both are FDA approved.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.160]   For certain purposes, they're being used off-label
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.180]   for increasing growth hormone and IGF-1
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:19.040]   for the sorts of things we're talking about here.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.180]   They are taken anywhere from three times per week
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.400]   to five times per week.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.080]   Keep in mind, tesamorelin lasts a little bit longer
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.620]   than sermorelin.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:30.140]   CJC 1295 is the third in that category
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.100]   of type one growth hormone secreting peptides,
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.720]   but it may, again, may, we don't know,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.080]   have some safety issues that still need to be resolved,
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.740]   making sermorelin and tesamorelin, at least to my mind,
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:43.700]   better options should you decide to go down this path.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.880]   The type two growth hormone releasing peptides
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.400]   include things like hexarellin,
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.160]   which are very potent at increasing growth hormone,
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.360]   but can potentially increase other things as well.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.240]   But of more concern is really that it can cause
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.600]   receptor desensitization,
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.340]   maybe even turn off the whole receptor pathway.
[00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.240]   That would not be good.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.640]   Ipermorelin, again, increases growth hormone directly
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.560]   and allows more of it to be released
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.720]   by suppressing its break, its natural break,
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.000]   which is the somatostatin.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.360]   And then the GHRP-2, 3, 6, and MK-677,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.520]   all of which can potently increase growth hormone,
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.500]   need to be considered in light of the fact
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.100]   that they cause big increases in cortisol,
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.800]   and in some cases can cause some receptor internalization
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.520]   or desensitization as well,
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.620]   although not as potently as hexarellin.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.200]   So hopefully that description clarifies
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   some of what you've heard out there
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.640]   about these different compounds
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.960]   and their different names, et cetera.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.200]   It can be very confusing.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.520]   I did take the liberty of designating a type one
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.920]   and a type two category.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.140]   I did that for sake of clarity
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.040]   because there are a lot of different acronyms and numbers,
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.920]   et cetera, that can be really confusing to people.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.440]   And I hope that that will be useful
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.400]   in facilitating further discussions
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.700]   about these compounds going forward.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.240]   Two additional brief, but important points.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.040]   Many of the peptide vendors that are out there
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.200]   and physicians that are working with peptides
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.340]   will combine different growth hormone-promoting peptides.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.800]   So they'll, for instance, have sermorellin or tesomerellin
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.520]   in combination with hexarellin,
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.760]   or they'll use ipermorellin in combination with CJC-1295.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.980]   While I'm not opposed to that approach,
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.080]   you just want to make sure that the dosing,
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.140]   or I should say the relative dosing of each peptide
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.880]   is such that you're avoiding unnecessary increases
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.440]   in prolactin and cortisol,
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.860]   and that you're not hitting a pathway redundantly.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.920]   That's actually the logic of combining different things.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.040]   These different amino acid sequences,
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.560]   these different peptides that is,
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.080]   are designed to stimulate different modes of action
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.680]   for the same peptide.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.220]   So the naturally occurring peptide
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.560]   goes and does a bunch of things, those pleiotropic effects.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.800]   And these different peptides
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.500]   that are of different amino acid sequences
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.600]   are designed to reduce visceral adiposity a bit more,
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.300]   or promote deep sleep a bit more,
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.240]   or to promote muscle growth a bit more.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.040]   So when people are combining different things in cocktail,
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.480]   it's not necessarily a bad thing,
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.880]   but you want to make sure that you're working with someone
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.080]   who's very familiar with peptides,
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.640]   you know, really has been in the peptide space
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.280]   for a long time and understands how these things work alone
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.400]   and in combination.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.440]   And there are some excellent physicians that are doing that.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.520]   And we plan to have at least one of them
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.680]   on the Huberman Lab podcast as a guest
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.840]   in the not too distant future.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.720]   And you can bet that this conversation
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.200]   will facilitate your understanding of that discussion.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.380]   The second point is that there are, of course,
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.640]   risks to taking anything,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.680]   but in particular to exploring augmentation
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.600]   of the growth hormone pathway.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.060]   When people take growth hormone itself,
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.840]   there are common risks such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.420]   That has to do in part with the fact
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.520]   that it can potently increase cartilage growth.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.240]   There can be active changes in the structure
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.040]   of one's head and face and body.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.400]   There's a so-called lean but distended gut.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.340]   So people that aren't carrying a lot of subcutaneous fat,
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.880]   but that the gut becomes extended.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.480]   Sometimes you can get changes in the face,
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.480]   like the kind of a thickening of the bone above the brow.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.560]   You'll see that.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.320]   And sometimes people will look quite different
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.400]   after taking growth hormone for a series of time
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.320]   than they did before.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.880]   It can really change one's stature
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.960]   and shape to a considerable degree.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   It also can create a kind of a skin texture
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.980]   that is a little bit unnatural or unusual.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.920]   You sometimes can see this
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.080]   in people that take a lot of growth hormone.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.140]   In general, when people take growth hormone
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.500]   promoting peptides,
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.400]   the changes in body structure are not as dramatic
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.440]   as when people take growth hormone itself.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.680]   But body shape changes and cosmetic changes aside,
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.040]   keep in mind that anytime we augment growth hormone,
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.320]   either by taking growth hormone directly
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.160]   as a synthetic compound,
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.440]   or by taking a peptide that increases the amount
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.280]   of growth hormone that we release,
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.000]   we are increasing our tumor growth risk and our cancer risk.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.080]   And that's because growth hormone and IGF-1
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.880]   are somewhat indiscriminate in terms of the tissues
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.500]   that they promote the growth of.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.680]   So if you have a tumor someplace and it's small,
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.760]   taking exogenous growth hormone
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.280]   or increasing the amount of growth hormone that you release
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.560]   by taking one of these peptides that we discussed
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.520]   will increase the size of that tumor.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.520]   It's very likely.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.380]   And you can imagine that if you're taking a peptide
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.400]   to increase growth hormone
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.560]   and you're taking something like BPC-157,
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.000]   something that a lot of people are starting to do nowadays,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.600]   you could potentially increase both the size
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.320]   and the vascularization of a given tumor.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.400]   So just keep that in mind,
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.500]   just as there are anti-cancer drugs
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.020]   that focus on the VEGF pathway
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.660]   to try and discourage vascularization of tumors,
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.440]   there are drugs that discourage the release
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.560]   of growth hormone to discourage the growth of tumors.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.240]   So if you're listening to this, you might be thinking,
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.220]   well, why in the world would anybody take this stuff?
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.780]   Well, people like the effects
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.140]   of having elevated growth hormone.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.320]   They like the effects of recovering
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.480]   from an injury more quickly,
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.300]   but there's always going to be a trade-off
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.940]   between potential benefit and potential risk.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.480]   The one thing that we can say
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.040]   for these growth hormone secretogogues,
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.700]   sermorelin, tesamorelin in particular,
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:56.960]   is that they are FDA approved as compounds.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.020]   However, they are not approved for all the purposes
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.080]   that people are taking them for,
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.060]   such as cosmetic effects, et cetera.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.960]   So I'm certainly not being disparaging of people
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.600]   that decide to make the choice to take these compounds.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.920]   That's your right entirely.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.920]   But I do think that you should be informed
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.080]   about the potential risks.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.440]   And if you are somebody who's considering
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.960]   taking any of these compounds,
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.080]   there are certain considerations
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.740]   that you definitely should pay attention to.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.640]   So for instance, how old are you?
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.720]   If you're younger than 30,
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.580]   I don't know why you'd want to augment growth hormone
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.760]   unless you and your doctor decide
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.920]   that there's a clinical need
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.720]   or some other urgent need to do so,
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.800]   because you're already making a lot of growth hormone.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.000]   If you're older than 30
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.720]   and you're interested in using these compounds,
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.920]   to me, it stands to reason that,
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.120]   of course, you want to make sure
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.880]   that you don't have any tumors or cancers
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.020]   that you could potentially exacerbate.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.360]   But in addition to that,
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.400]   that you really think about
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.000]   using the minimal effective dose
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.120]   and that you use perhaps even the mildest
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.480]   of these different compounds
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.640]   in order to make sure that you don't desensitize
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.120]   any of the receptor pathways.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.200]   And of course, there is no reason
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.640]   why anyone should use these compounds
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.520]   unless they absolutely feel they need to,
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.980]   and there's a potential benefit there.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.640]   I personally, as I mentioned before,
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.640]   tried sermorelin for a short while.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.500]   The reductions in rapid eye movement sleep
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.700]   were problematic enough for me
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.580]   that I decided to just not take it.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.920]   And it's not something that I've returned to
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.560]   except every once in a great while,
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.080]   I might do it to augment deep sleep just a little bit.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.760]   The next category of peptide effects
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.120]   that we're going to discuss
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.360]   are peptides involved in longevity.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.660]   And this is actually going to be a pretty quick discussion
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.360]   because really the main one in this category,
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.000]   besides thymosin beta-4,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.360]   remember thymosin beta-4 we talked about earlier,
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.040]   this is a peptide that's naturally released from the thymus
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.000]   and the thymus is a structure that depletes over time
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.280]   as children age.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.160]   So some people will take thymosin beta-4
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.800]   as kind of a longevity agent,
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.840]   hoping that it will increase repair of tissues,
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.740]   recovery from exercise, et cetera,
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.240]   but it's not really aimed at longevity per se.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.820]   It's really aimed at replacing something
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.760]   that's present in youth
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.520]   and then tends to dissipate as we get older,
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.680]   that is the thymus and related peptides from the thymus.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.640]   But the big one in the category of peptides
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.080]   to potentially, I want to highlight,
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.820]   potentially improve longevity is epitalin.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:03.720]   Epitalin is also sometimes spelled and pronounced epithalin.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.280]   Okay, don't ask me why.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.340]   And as with BPC-157,
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.340]   there are quite a few animal studies exploring epithalin
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.840]   and its effects on various tissues,
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.680]   as well as the naturally occurring peptide
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.920]   that it's meant to resemble.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.960]   Epithalin is a peptide that's secreted
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.640]   from the pineal gland.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.700]   The pineal gland is a gland that most people associate
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.900]   with melatonin release,
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.080]   and that's because the cells within the pineal,
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:31.040]   called pinealocytes, secrete melatonin at night.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.280]   It's what makes us feel sleepy and go to sleep.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.080]   Melatonin is suppressed by light viewed by the eyes.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.920]   There's actually a pathway that goes from the eyes
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.760]   into the brain.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.580]   There are a couple of stages.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.880]   They go up through the cervical ganglion
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.600]   from the brainstem and up to the pineal
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.160]   and suppress melatonin release.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.760]   Now, the pineal makes other things besides melatonin.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.560]   It also makes a peptide called epithalamin.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.560]   Epithalamin is a peptide that is naturally released
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.720]   from the pineal, especially early in life,
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:01.200]   and that's associated with various anti-inflammatory effects
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.600]   on other cells and tissues in the body.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.280]   And it does appear to be able to adjust telomere length,
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.820]   which is a feature of cells that's thought to be associated
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.620]   with the longevity of cells or how long they live.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:14.980]   Keep in mind that the relationship between telomeres
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.040]   and longevity is a controversial one.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.540]   People were very excited about this some years back.
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.600]   Then people batted down that idea,
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.200]   showing that telomere length was not associated
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.840]   with longevity, especially in humans.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.960]   And now it's sort of a back and forth within the field.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.160]   Keep in mind that epitalin, again,
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.040]   also sometimes written and pronounced epithalin,
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.440]   is designed to mimic this naturally occurring
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.060]   peptide epithalamin, okay?
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.920]   So the nomenclature can get a little bit confusing.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.660]   And what you'll find is that epitalin is available
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.080]   as a synthetic compound.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.920]   It can be obtained in clean form from compounding pharmacies.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.560]   And a good number of people will use it
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.040]   as a longevity agent based largely on animal data
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.340]   that it can suppress tumor growth.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.300]   It can increase telomere length.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.840]   And to some extent that it can recalibrate
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.640]   the circadian rhythm changes and the disruptions
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.920]   in the patterns of melatonin that occur as animals
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   and perhaps as humans age.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.000]   This is an important point.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.520]   The pineal gland, despite being very, very small,
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.920]   about the size of a pea and sitting kind of in the mid area
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.520]   of the brain for you aficionados,
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.800]   it sits kind of like right on the roof of the diencephalon.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.320]   And what it does is it will release melatonin each night
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.960]   in darkness, it can release epithalamin.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.360]   And at those times, it can go and have these myriad effects
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.540]   on restoring the brain and body during sleep.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.900]   There are other things that occur during sleep
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:42.440]   that are essential, but those are key components
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.260]   of the restorative features of sleep.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:47.440]   Now we know that as we age, the amount of melatonin
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.860]   that we release is decreased such that if you look in babies
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:55.140]   and teens, et cetera, melatonin levels are very, very high
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:58.700]   compared to people of middle age and of elderly age.
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.180]   Likewise, epithalamin levels decrease with time.
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.020]   And as a consequence, markers of tissue inflammation
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.940]   also increase as we age 'cause you're sort of removing
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.220]   this anti-inflammatory compound that's released each night.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.260]   Now there are a bunch of theories
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.980]   as to why the pineal regresses with age.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:17.380]   There's some kind of wild ones about fluoride
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.500]   and a depletion of the pineal.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.320]   I'll do a whole episode on the pineal at some point
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.500]   and we'll explore that.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.660]   Some of them are very niche.
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.780]   Some of them are frankly completely false
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.700]   and others have some merit and are starting
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:31.960]   to gain some data within the standard scientific community.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.140]   The overall point here about peptides for longevity
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.020]   can be summarized very easily.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.420]   The logic is just as we have a thymus early in life,
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.300]   the thymus secretes certain things
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.660]   and those things seem to accelerate
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.980]   robust tissue healing early in life.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.300]   And as the thymus disappears,
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.300]   tissue healing gets less robust.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.940]   That's the logic for taking things like thymus
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.220]   and beta-4, TB 500.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:57.300]   So too, we have a tissue, the pineal,
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.660]   that secretes certain things early in life
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.860]   that are associated with lots of deep sleep
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:06.540]   and robust tissue repair and long cellular life.
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.020]   The logic then is by taking epitalin,
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.860]   you can mimic this peptide that's normally released
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.180]   from a nice, young, healthy pineal.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:18.300]   And in that sense, encourage anti-inflammation pathways
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.200]   as well as cellular longevity pathways.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.700]   That's the basic idea.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.700]   And again, it rests largely on the animal data for which,
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.340]   yes, there's some interesting studies
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:31.140]   showing suppression of age-related ocular diseases.
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.260]   There's some nice studies showing telomere expansion.
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.340]   There's some nice studies showing
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:38.380]   that several features of brain aging and body aging
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.700]   can indeed be partially offset
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.080]   by things like epitalin peptides.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.160]   But it is indeed a leap that people are taking
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.580]   when they are deciding or taking epitalin
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.140]   in order to extend their life, right?
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.960]   It's the logic is all there,
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.740]   but the pieces are sort of kludged together
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.660]   between what we know about the animal studies,
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.260]   what we know about the naturally occurring compounds
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.580]   that these peptides are designed to mimic.
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.480]   And yet there are still no clinical trials
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.680]   that point directly to taking X amount of epitalin
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.180]   several times per week as a way to extend life.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.620]   The fourth and final category of peptide effects
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.900]   that we're going to talk about are effects on vitality,
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.660]   both mood and libido.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.580]   And really the main players within this category of peptides
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.620]   are the so-called
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:25.680]   melanocyte-stimulating hormone-related peptides, okay?
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.420]   Just to give you a little bit of background,
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.940]   remember the pituitary?
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:29.980]   The pituitary gland,
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.060]   that stalk that extends out of the brain
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:35.500]   and can release growth hormone from the anterior pituitary?
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.060]   Well, it's got a middle segment or a medial segment,
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.740]   and there's a hormone that's released from there
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.420]   called melanocyte-stimulating hormone.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.820]   Melanocyte-stimulating hormone
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.540]   has the effect of stimulating pigmentation of the skin
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.480]   by activating what are called melanocytes
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.280]   that exist within the skin.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.700]   So the peptides, melanotan-1, melanotan-2,
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.180]   melanotan-3, melanotan-4, melanotan-5,
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.300]   because there are five of them,
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.460]   are different peptides,
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.480]   that is peptides with different amino acid sequences,
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.380]   all of which mimic naturally occurring
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.620]   melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:10.060]   but that act preferentially on one set of melanocyte-stimulating
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.540]   hormone receptors or another
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.500]   in order to get different effects.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.600]   So let's back up a little bit
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.140]   and talk about the melanocortin system, right?
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:22.120]   The melanocortin system is a system whereby viewing light
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.240]   or getting light on the skin,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.220]   typically ultraviolet light of the ultraviolet B type,
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.260]   okay, there's two different types of ultraviolet light,
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:33.220]   but basically sunlight is what the system evolved
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:34.140]   to respond to,
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.020]   shown to the eyes and/or to the skin,
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.780]   stimulates the melanocortin system.
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.300]   It goes from the eyes to the hypothalamus,
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.820]   from the hypothalamus to the pituitary,
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.980]   and then the melanocyte-stimulating hormone
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.700]   is then released into the bloodstream,
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.780]   can travel to the melanocytes
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.740]   and cause pigmentation of the skin.
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.020]   This is what is responsible for tanning.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.360]   There's also a pathway whereby the light stimulates
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.340]   the melanocyte-stimulating hormone system,
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.340]   and in parallel, it stimulates the release of dopamine.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.740]   Now, for any of you that have lived
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.140]   in a part of the world in which it's very, very dark
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.140]   with very short days in the winter
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.980]   and longer days and a lot of sunlight during the summer,
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.060]   you're probably familiar with the fact
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.580]   that when the sun comes out, people start feeling better.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:18.460]   They have more energy, they're more motivated.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.020]   A number of different systems related to mood and libido
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.700]   tend to increase.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.860]   This is the consequence of sunlight
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.420]   activating the melanocorticoid system.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.220]   And by the way, this system is very active
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.420]   in other animals as well,
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.980]   animals that are white
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.400]   or tend to be a pale color during the winter.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.060]   Then as spring arrives,
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.900]   the sunlight stimulates this very same system
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.520]   and leads to darkening of the pelage,
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.220]   so their hair goes from white or gray to brown
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.000]   or even dark black or some combination of those.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.020]   And in combination, dopamine is increased,
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:50.860]   libido is increased,
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.960]   and the animals start breeding
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.380]   in the spring and summer months.
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:56.100]   Okay, so this is a well-conserved system across species,
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.940]   and it exists to some extent in us as well.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:02.940]   So there are essentially five different synthetic peptides
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:05.240]   called melanotan 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.020]   each of which is designed to mimic
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:10.020]   melanocyte-simulating hormone,
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.320]   but each of which activates different receptors
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.840]   to different degrees,
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.620]   and some can cross the blood-brain barrier and some can't.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:17.460]   And as a consequence,
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:21.100]   some impact mood and libido and others don't.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.420]   The simple way to look at this is that melanotan 1
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.860]   does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.540]   It does, however, stimulate the melanocytes of the skin,
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.940]   so it leads to tanning or darkening of the skin.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.860]   Melanotan 2, 3, 4, and 5
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.380]   also lead to darkening of the skin
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:39.660]   by way of activating melanocytes in the skin,
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.340]   but because they can cross the blood-brain barrier,
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:46.640]   they cause effects that are at the level of psychology,
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.000]   really, and at the level of appetite
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:49.940]   and things of that sort.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.920]   In general, the pattern is to increase mood and libido
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.360]   and to decrease appetite.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.980]   Things that are associated with the transition
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.120]   from winter to spring and summer months
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.060]   in humans and in other animals.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.960]   Now, one of the things about the peptide literature
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.680]   is that it loves acronyms and numbers,
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.860]   and so there's a peptide, PT-141,
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.280]   that falls into this category
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.300]   of activating the melanocorticoid system.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:20.220]   And PT-141 is also known as the prescription drug, Vilese.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:23.400]   PT-141, or Vilese, is FDA-approved
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.640]   for the treatment of premenopausal hypoactive sexual desire.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.960]   So this is FDA-approved for the treatment of women
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.000]   that have suppressed libido.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.600]   However, men also will take Vilese
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.500]   for hypoactive sexual desire.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.680]   This is obviously prescribed off-label by physicians,
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.560]   but keep in mind, as with the other peptides
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.400]   in this pathway, Vilese will stimulate pigmentation.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.560]   So whether or not you consider that a side effect
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.060]   or a benefit depends on, I guess,
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.480]   your baseline level of pigmentation
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.240]   and how much level of pigmentation you actually want.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.360]   Now, there are some side effects
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   associated with these compounds.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.800]   One of the more common ones is nausea,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.160]   and that's because there are melanocytes
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.560]   simulating hormone receptors all throughout the gut.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.060]   They can also cause flushing of the skin,
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.660]   and they can cause blood pressure to increase.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.660]   Also, folks with melanoma should be very cautious
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.600]   about using any of the peptides that stimulate melanocytes
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.580]   because that could potentially exacerbate melanoma.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.020]   The next peptide in this category,
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.820]   peptides for vitality and libido, is kispeptin.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:30.100]   Kispeptin is a peptide that wasn't discovered that long ago.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.500]   I actually can recall when the first papers
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.220]   about kispeptin came out.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.220]   And basically, kispeptin is a peptide
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.200]   that is naturally made within the brain,
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.920]   and it's upstream of some of the hypothalamic signals
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.520]   that activate the pituitary
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.680]   for sake of hormone production and reproduction.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.240]   So I'll just walk you through this pathway.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.800]   It's actually quite simple.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   You've got the pituitary.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.200]   You're now familiar with the pituitary.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.280]   And the pituitary releases two different hormones
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.260]   in both males and females.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.320]   It releases luteinizing hormone,
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.880]   and it releases follicle-stimulating hormone.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.000]   If you watched the episodes
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.300]   that we did about testosterone and estrogen,
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.840]   if you watched the episode that I did
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.600]   on male and female fertility,
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.180]   if you watched the episode that I did
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.280]   with Dr. Michael Eisenberg from Stanford
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.560]   or Dr. Natalie Crawford,
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.400]   who's an OBGYN specializing in fertility,
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.240]   we talked a lot about LH and FSH.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.980]   Basically, FSH, as the name suggests,
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.640]   stimulates the growth of the follicle,
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.120]   the egg in the female,
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.840]   and it stimulates sperm production in males.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.720]   Luteinizing hormone stimulates testosterone production
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.040]   from the gonad in males,
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.620]   and it also stimulates estrogen production
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.460]   and to some extent,
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.900]   testosterone production in females as well.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.140]   So we need LH and FSH to stimulate the gonads,
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:44.200]   the ovary or the testes.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.440]   The hormone that stimulates LH and FSH release
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.180]   is called GNRH or gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.500]   and it comes from the hypothalamus.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:57.980]   So GNRH is a signal that promotes LH and FSH release.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.780]   Now that raises the question, what turns on GNRH?
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:03.980]   And the signal that turns on GNRH is cispeptin.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.160]   Cispeptin, in other words,
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:08.940]   is further upstream from GNRH and LSH and FSH.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.780]   It's a cascade.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:14.540]   It goes cispeptin, GNRH, LH, FSH, testosterone, estrogen.
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.340]   Okay, that's the pathway.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:19.260]   Now, it's very clear that cispeptin is involved
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.120]   in the activation of puberty,
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.100]   the transition from pre-pubertal
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.940]   to post-pubertal stages of life.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:29.900]   It's also involved in any of the sort of downstream effects
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:33.980]   of having elevated LH and FSH, including elevated vitality,
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.340]   which includes both energy and in some cases, libido.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.940]   So there's naturally occurring cispeptin,
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.140]   and there's now synthetically generated cispeptin
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.540]   designed to mimic naturally occurring cispeptin,
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.340]   and it's actually prescribed
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.540]   for what's called hypothalamic amenorrhea.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.020]   Hypothalamic amenorrhea is the loss
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:56.060]   or the absence of periods of menstrual cycles
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:58.720]   that are the consequence of deficits
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.500]   within the hypothalamus itself.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.860]   So not something within the ovary
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:05.020]   or a lack of the pituitary to make LH or FSH,
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:09.100]   but a deficit of the hypothalamus to promote LH and FSH
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.340]   and the downstream hormones, testosterone and estrogen.
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.740]   Incidentally, there are also cispeptin antagonists, okay,
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:18.180]   drugs that are designed to suppress cispeptin,
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.220]   and those are used to treat some of the symptoms
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.900]   of menopause, including night sweats
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.480]   and some of the, what are called vasomotor symptoms.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.700]   So cispeptin is obviously a key player
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.560]   in this whole pathway of steroid hormone release,
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.560]   the steroid hormones being testosterone and estrogen.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.880]   There are other steroid hormones as well, of course.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.280]   Now, there are folks within the landscape
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.360]   of peptide therapeutics,
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.080]   folks meaning physicians and other practitioners,
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.080]   who said, "Ah, well, here's a peptide
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.340]   "that is known to promote all these hormone pathways
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.080]   "that are associated with vitality, libido, et cetera."
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.480]   And so there are people who take cispeptin peptides
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.800]   as a way to stimulate these pathways,
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.400]   and they're doing so for the specific purpose
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.820]   of increasing vitality as it relates to libido and mood,
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.980]   and to get the downstream increases
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.620]   on testosterone and estrogen.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.820]   And of course, some people are taking cispeptin peptides
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.900]   to treat hypothalamic amenorrhea.
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:06.740]   And as I mentioned,
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.840]   some people are taking cispeptin antagonists.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.040]   They're trying to block the cispeptin pathway
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.140]   in order to reduce some of the vasomotor
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.140]   and other symptoms of menopause.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.180]   I will say, despite the fact
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.060]   that the cispeptin pathway is well-known,
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.500]   and despite the fact that the cispeptin peptide
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.660]   is designed to mimic a naturally occurring peptide
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.420]   that has a pretty constrained set of functions
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:28.980]   in the hypothalamic pituitary system,
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.980]   and their downstream effects on the gonads,
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:34.700]   the use of cispeptin to increase vitality and libido
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:37.060]   is a bit of a, let's just say,
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.820]   it's a little bit of a wild card.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.620]   We don't yet know all the effects of cispeptin.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.740]   Again, it was fairly recently discovered.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.300]   We have it in mind that it's involved in these pathways,
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.300]   but I should say, every time we look at a given peptide,
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.960]   whether or not it's ghrelin, or hypocretin orexin,
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.780]   or it's GLP-1, what we find is that, again,
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.700]   there are these pleiotropic effects.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:00.020]   There is rarely, if ever, one specific effect,
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.980]   and it's not just a concern about side effects
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.620]   that we want to take these pleiotropic effects
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.120]   into consideration.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.700]   It's the fact that even though we know a lot
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.500]   about the human body and the various hormones
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.940]   and neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera,
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:13.620]   that are made, this landscape of peptides
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.940]   is an enormous one, and it's one for which
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.660]   we are just now really starting to appreciate
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:22.120]   how many different peptides the human body and brain make.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.100]   Again, I don't think it's an overestimate
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.200]   to say that there are probably hundreds of thousands
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.000]   of different peptides, each with multiple
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.840]   and sometimes even overlapping and synergistic effects.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.780]   So, I do understand the excitement
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.280]   about peptide therapeutics.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.020]   I think for a lot of people that want to improve
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.820]   their physical health and mental health,
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.680]   they want to recover from injuries more quickly.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.700]   Maybe they're seeking particular aesthetic changes
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.360]   or mood changes, et cetera.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.080]   I understand the gravitational pull
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080]   and the excitement of peptides,
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.720]   but I have noticed that the discussion around peptides,
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.000]   because it's in contrast often to the discussion
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.240]   around hormone therapies like testosterone therapy
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:01.680]   and estrogen therapy, people, I think,
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.760]   inadvertently assume that peptides are all safe
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:08.160]   or innocuous or that they are potent enough
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.840]   to do certain things that we want,
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.520]   but that because they're not hormone therapies per se,
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.360]   that they are free of side effects and risk.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.780]   And in addition to wanting to teach you
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:19.600]   about some of the biology of these peptides
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600]   and how they work and what they're designed to do,
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.920]   as well as some of their potential therapeutic benefits
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.960]   under the right conditions,
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.880]   again, working with a really good board certified physician
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.240]   and making sure that the sourcing is really clean
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.540]   and that you're doing regular blood testing
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.600]   and you're monitoring for any potential tumor growth,
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.800]   et cetera, I also want to emphasize
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.920]   that these are very potent compounds.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.400]   They have lots of different effects.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.160]   And we are in the early stages
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.200]   of exploring peptide therapeutics.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.960]   Again, I'm not here to tell you what to do
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.160]   or what not to do, but if you have it in mind
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.200]   that peptide therapeutics,
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.240]   because they aren't hormone therapies,
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.440]   are not without their potential risks, you would be wrong.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.560]   All of that said, it's very exciting to see
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.240]   what's happening with peptide therapeutics.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.440]   I'm excited about their potential
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.000]   for both the treatment of disease,
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.520]   as well as for augmentation of mental and physical health.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.320]   And I think it's an exciting landscape
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.080]   that certainly motivated my desire to do this episode
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.400]   and get you familiar with them,
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.480]   or at least with some of them.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.940]   And it's something that we're definitely going
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.960]   to be exploring more on this podcast,
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.680]   both with expert guests and in solo episodes going forward.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.880]   If you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,

[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.440]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast,
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.140]   or guests or topics that you'd like me to cover
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.600]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.880]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.560]   I do read all the comments.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.100]   Not so much on today's episode,
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.880]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.320]   we discuss supplements.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.340]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.600]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.020]   for things like improving sleep,
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:03.200]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.320]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.880]   has partnered with Momentus Supplements,
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.640]   and we've done that for several reasons.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.580]   First, Momentus Supplements are of the very highest quality.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.100]   Second, Momentus tends to focus
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:13.980]   on single ingredient formulations,
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.180]   which is essential in order to develop
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.500]   the most biologically effective
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.100]   and cost-effective supplement regimen for you.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:22.160]   Third, Momentus ships internationally,
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.380]   which we realize is important
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:26.520]   because many of you reside outside of the United States.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.820]   To learn more about the supplements
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.460]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.140]   please go to LiveMomentus, spelled O-U-S,
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.060]   so it's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:37.420]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.980]   I'm @hubermanlab on all social media platforms,
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.100]   so that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:45.500]   And at all of those places,
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.500]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.180]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:50.380]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.540]   but much of which is distinct
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.700]   from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:56.960]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.160]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.540]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:00.780]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.860]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:05.420]   that gives podcast summaries and protocols
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.020]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:10.220]   covering things like neuroplasticity and learning
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.820]   or optimizing sleep or regulating dopamine,
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:13.980]   deliberate cold exposure.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:15.900]   We have a foundational fitness protocol.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.440]   Again, all of those available, completely zero cost.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.580]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the Menu tab,
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.800]   scroll down to Newsletter, and supply your email.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.340]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:29.220]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.540]   about the science and application of peptide therapeutics.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.800]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.700]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:40.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:42.120]   you
