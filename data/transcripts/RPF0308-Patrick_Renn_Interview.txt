[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.120]   One of my secret agendas with Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   [Evil laugh]
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.000]   is to expose the world of financial advice
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.760]   to the light and see what stands up and what doesn't.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.800]   Now, it can be bad or we can point out some of the problems in the financial
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.000]   advisor world or as in today's show it can be pretty cool.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.600]   Today we get a chance to talk with Patrick Wren, a long, tenured financial advisor.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.520]   We're going to talk about what it means to find your money's greater purpose
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.920]   and most importantly, or I guess most interestingly, not most importantly, but very interestingly,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.920]   we're going to talk about some specific tools and strategies that you can use
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.440]   to leverage the power of your money
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.520]   to increase your charitable contributions,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520]   increase the money that goes to your heirs,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   and you know the only person that gets shorted on this deal?
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.000]   The IRS. Not about you, but I'm pretty cool with that.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   [Music]
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.240]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.560]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.040]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280]   This is a show where we're all about living a rich life now
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.160]   and building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.440]   But hey, guess what? You know what happens?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.000]   If you do a good job of living a rich life now
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.400]   and you become financially free,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.640]   most likely you're going to wind up with way more money than you can spend.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.640]   So what do you do then?
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   [Music]
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.360]   My guest today is a man named Patrick Wren.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.640]   Patrick is a 69-year-old financial advisor.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.840]   He's been a financial advisor for over 35 years.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   And the way we got connected here was his publicist contacted me.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.240]   And this is a regular occurrence when you're a podcast host.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.000]   You get lots of contacts from people wanting to just talk with you about,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.080]   wanting to use the show as a platform for them.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.920]   And I turned most of them down.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.160]   But today I really wanted to talk with Patrick
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.960]   because of his tenure in the financial advice business
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.800]   and also because of his area of focus.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.360]   He's written a book called Find Your Money's Greater Purpose,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.960]   How to Make Your Legacy Count,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.640]   which is a slim little volume that's just simply focused on giving you
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   some tools and strategies and techniques that you can use
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.840]   to really enhance your charitable opportunities.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.600]   But Patrick focuses on working with people
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.400]   at that kind of traditional retirement age,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   60s, probably 60 to 80 years old,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.160]   and helping them manage their retirement income needs
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.640]   as well as helping them manage their charitable needs.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.200]   And so you're going to enjoy today's conversation,
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.000]   especially if you have a bent toward the technical financial planning side of things.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.920]   We're going to talk a little bit about some estate planning strategies.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.240]   We're going to talk about charitable remainder trusts and grantor.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.680]   We're just going to talk about a few charitable remainder trusts.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.760]   We're talking about gifting life insurance policies.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.000]   So if you enjoy some of these little techniques,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.400]   you're going to enjoy today's show.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Patrick is a good guy, and especially if you're a financial advisor,
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   if you like the idea or the topic of financial advice,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.760]   this will be a show for you.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.720]   Not a lot of rah-rah, not a big business-making show,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.320]   just very practical, down-to-earth experience
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.200]   from somebody who's been there in the trenches for 35 years
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.760]   as a financial advisor.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   Before I play the interview for you, I want to do two sponsors today.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.800]   Number one is YNAB. You need a budget.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.120]   Guess what?
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.320]   Budgeting is the fundamental foundation of all good financial planning.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.120]   Even in Patrick's book, we didn't talk about this extensively,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.760]   but you've got to answer the question of how much money do you need?
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.120]   How much is enough? How much do you need to spend each year?
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.960]   And guess what? If you don't know that answer,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.720]   none of these techniques are going to work for you.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.160]   If you don't know what you're actually spending
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.840]   and you don't know how to allocate it,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.480]   that's a skill that will grow over time.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.360]   But you've got to start now, and the best way to start is with YNAB.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.240]   You need a budget budgeting software.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.000]   This is what I use. This is what I use every day.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.920]   I have a personal budget and a business budget,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.880]   and I budget all the money that's in the account using the YNAB software.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.000]   That's as strong as an endorsement as I can make.

[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.600]   Second sponsor of today's show
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.440]   is student loan attorney and podcast host Jay Fleischman.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.200]   Jay's been on the show a couple times.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   If you have student loans, I would strongly recommend
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.440]   that you consider reaching out to Jay for a review of your situation.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.120]   He is an attorney, both student loan attorney and bankruptcy attorney.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.280]   So if you're in any kind of difficult, contentious case
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.800]   or if you know anyone who is, feel free to connect them with Jay.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.720]   He can help you on that.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   But most importantly, he's an expert at the student loan payoff options,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.400]   and he's really done a great job of helping people
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.640]   establish the lowest-cost opportunity and ways to pay that off.

[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.520]   And here is the interview with Patrick.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.080]   Patrick Oren, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.600]   Thank you, Jay.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.440]   When your publicist contacted me
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.840]   about potentially bringing you on the show,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.240]   I usually say no to most of these inquiries,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.000]   but I said yes to you because of the topic of this book
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.520]   that you've written, which I hold here in my hands,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.000]   called "Finding Your Money's Greater Purpose,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.040]   How to Make Your Legacy Count."
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.840]   And this is a topic that I've done short shrift to on the show.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.880]   I'd like to have covered it more,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.360]   but I just simply haven't gotten around to it.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.000]   I said, "Well, let me have an expert who's written the book
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.080]   to share with us on the topic."
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.720]   So before we dig into the specific topic of the book, though,
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.120]   share with us a little bit about your professional background
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.640]   and the circumstances that resulted in your writing this book.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.720]   Sure. I've been a professional financial advisor
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.480]   really all my adult career.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.080]   That spans 40 years now.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.560]   And I'm at the point of my life,
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.480]   along with most of my clients,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.880]   where it's a little more reflective
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.360]   and a little more interested
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.760]   in what ultimate legacy we might leave.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.480]   So really the book is part of that for me.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   It is what I refer to from time to time
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.480]   as my instructional manual to the next generation.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.080]   And tells a lot about some of my personal experiences
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.040]   and my life and how financial planning
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.320]   has played a part in that to enhance what I'm doing.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.880]   Do you practice in this area as a specialty
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   or is this more of, as you said,
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.200]   simply because your clients have gotten
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.760]   to this stage of life,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.240]   it's kind of a natural growth process?
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.560]   I think it has developed into a specialty.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.560]   It's a niche that I'm known for in my community.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.600]   I work with several nonprofits and their donors
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.680]   and most of it has to do with integrating mission
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.440]   with those donors desire
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.960]   to really enhance their situation financially,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   but also to see if what they're doing can be improved
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.880]   in terms of their own personal situation,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.840]   their family legacy,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.040]   and those institutions and causes that they care about,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.320]   if that can be enhanced financially.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.000]   And the answer is that it can in most cases,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.680]   people can come out better financially
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.040]   when they include philanthropy in some of their plans,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.560]   believe it or not.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.080]   - I wanna talk about some of the tactics
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.000]   and specific strategies,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.040]   but I wanna start more with the bigger picture overview
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.520]   before we go below the horizon and dig into those things.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.840]   Is philanthropy something that's only appropriate
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.880]   for people to think about at a certain stage of their life?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.720]   - Well, I don't think so.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.400]   I think frankly, today there's this whole group
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.160]   of social entrepreneur,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.760]   the younger 30-ish to 40-ish,
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.480]   entrepreneur who has more of a social consciousness
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.600]   than perhaps my generation did.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.360]   I'm part of the baby boomer generation.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.560]   We did a lot of whining early on,
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.760]   (laughing)
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.440]   we're kind of known for that.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.120]   And we complained about a lot of things.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.560]   Then we went to work,
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.640]   and then after working for a while,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.760]   we realized that we could integrate
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.680]   some of the bigger picture issues with our life's work.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.720]   But to answer your question,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.000]   I find younger people, frankly,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.520]   that generation of Gen X and millennials
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   are much more socially aware
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.600]   of what they might be able to do
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.800]   at an earlier time in their life.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.320]   It's been a surprise to me, frankly.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.760]   - Does this approach involve money and giving money,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.200]   or are you simply talking about it
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.840]   just from the perspective of working?
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.200]   - Well, it involves giving money,
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.040]   but it also involves giving time and talent.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.880]   I mean, I think you can do an awful lot
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.680]   without strictly looking at money.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.000]   I'll give you a personal example.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.040]   I've been involved with Special Olympics.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.560]   That was one of the causes that early on
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.440]   kind of instilled a wake-up call in me.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.480]   And I got my children involved in it.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.360]   I had two boys, and I got them to volunteer.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.480]   I got my employees involved in the program.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.320]   And my children were preteen.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.360]   They were in their years, I would say,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.600]   was around six, seven, and eight.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.120]   We'd go to the games, volunteer, spend the night.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.560]   And I think it instilled in them some values
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.980]   that are not necessarily simply financial.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.680]   - Where do you start in trying to figure out
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.120]   how to make your money count?
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.440]   - Well, I think you start with
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.760]   what is it that the money needs to accomplish?
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   Typically, it needs to evolve into a nest egg
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.760]   or a pile of money that will support an individual,
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   the family, and then eventually institutions
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.040]   and causes they care about.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.240]   So I would start with the idea
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.720]   of present and future cashflow.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.000]   What does that really need to be?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.880]   And then see what the number is that would produce that.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.280]   And how obtainable is that?
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.400]   Is that something easily obtainable?
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.500]   Or does the individual have to adjust a little bit
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.280]   in terms of their desires and objectives?
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.160]   - Do you find in practicing this segment,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.640]   'cause when I was a financial advisor,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.280]   I had a few clients who were entering retirement.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.720]   That was my competitive advantage.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.480]   I said, "I'm gonna be the 30-year-old financial advisor
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.120]   "who specializes in working with 55 and 60-year-olds."
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.920]   That way I could tell them, "Listen, your advisor's
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.940]   "gonna be retiring when you are.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.880]   "Don't you wanna work with me?
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.440]   "He's gonna be here for your whole lifetime."
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.200]   I figured I could cut against my smarter,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   more experienced competition by rephrasing the opportunity.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.920]   But I didn't get deeply, I didn't have a broad client base
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.520]   of clients that I'd worked with on this topic for years.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.120]   So I'd like for you to share your perspective
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.200]   specifically with specific situations and examples
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.960]   to help people begin with the end in mind,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.700]   to help see where they're likely going to be.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.480]   So when you're dealing with somebody
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.440]   who's at this traditional retirement stage,
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.320]   do you find that they wanna spend all the money,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.360]   they wanna give it away?
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.920]   How do you find people approaching that problem
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.120]   in their own situation?
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.840]   - Sure, I'll give you a concrete example.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.260]   I had a neighbor that worked with
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.280]   one of the financial institutions here in town
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   for many years and was given an opportunity to retire early.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.320]   This is not unusual when you get to a certain stage
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.200]   of the corporations may want to make an exchange
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.000]   of an older, more costly employee
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.520]   for a younger, lesser costly employee.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.040]   And we have quite a few clients
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.720]   that were given that opportunity.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.040]   So the whole question was, was there enough there
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.600]   to support the lifestyle they wanted to?
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.880]   They were still relatively young, this was a couple.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.360]   They had two children who were adult children.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.160]   So it boils down to a financial analysis
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.540]   to see if what is doable.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.920]   I would tell you that for most of our clients,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.040]   they very much live within their means.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.960]   It's just one of those things
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.760]   that has happened to us over the years.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.960]   We've attracted that kind of client.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.080]   So in this particular instance, we work with these folks.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.880]   He retired about five or six years ago now.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.880]   And what is very common in our particular practice
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.480]   is we're now working with those children
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.160]   and the grandchildren who don't even know us frankly yet,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.760]   but we're developing a family legacy plan
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.680]   such that the money is not gonna run out
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.240]   based on the way they're situated.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.640]   And what happens to the money with the future generations
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.320]   is part of our planning as well.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:47.960]   - Do you find, talk to me about how people should think
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.880]   or just talk observationally.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.440]   How have you observed your clients
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.120]   considering the value and benefit of transferring money
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.160]   to their bloodline, to their heirs,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.560]   versus the value and benefit of transferring money
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.080]   to external institutions with charitable,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.160]   with a charitable focus?
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.640]   - Sure, you know, many times you can leverage
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.960]   because of the tax advantages of gifting
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.680]   and the fact that you can make a future gift,
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   even one that will occur after you're long gone
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.520]   from this life and receive a current tax deduction.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.080]   The fact that that tax deduction actually puts money back
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.960]   into your pocket, allows you to do some planning
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.080]   with respect to the family.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.680]   The other big advantage we have today is that for a couple,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.160]   we have about $11 million
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.080]   that would not be subject to a state tax.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.600]   So then the real question becomes how much of that,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.200]   let's just say it's right at 11 million,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.840]   how much of that 11 million should go to family?
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.040]   And usually there's a number
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.160]   that does not approach 11 million.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   And if that's the case,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.040]   then where should the rest of it go?
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   And most of us have some form of payback desire,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:19.440]   let's put it, to our school or our church or synagogue
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.880]   or some institution that somewhere along the line
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.200]   had a beneficial effect on our life.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.760]   And now we're in a position to maybe give back
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.440]   and help that institution thrive.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.520]   And in some cases just survive,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.720]   if they're financially in not the best of shape.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.200]   - How do I decide on how much is the appropriate amount
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.640]   of money to leave to my kids?
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.520]   - That's a very subjective question, I believe,
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.600]   and a very subjective answer.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.560]   And I would tell you that it differs tremendously
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.360]   within the family unit.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.720]   Usually, and I tell people this,
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.520]   fair is not necessarily equal.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.000]   So if there's more than one,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.160]   I would caution against automatically assuming
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.440]   that everyone should get an equal amount.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.280]   And usually we find in family discussions with siblings,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.720]   they're okay with that.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.320]   You may have a professional person on the one hand
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.680]   that is gonna have plenty of income and plenty of assets,
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.200]   ability to accumulate plenty of assets over their lifetime.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.600]   And you may have someone else
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.840]   who is not in the same position,
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.440]   maybe a teacher, maybe in the ministry,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.480]   maybe has some special needs,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.160]   maybe just hasn't gotten their act together.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.000]   And usually siblings are,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.640]   I find very aware of that.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.040]   And are okay with it.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.080]   The ones that are,
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.880]   the successful ones are okay with helping out
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.480]   the other sibling financially.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.400]   That usually means that the money needs to be
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   somehow managed beyond the control of the sibling
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.080]   that is the one that needs the help.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.880]   Because if they got their hands on the money right away,
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.800]   it could be a disaster.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   You can help one person by giving them money immediately
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.600]   and you can also hurt a person doing that.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.560]   So I would say you have to spend a lot of time
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.080]   trying to figure that one out.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.840]   - What would you look for to understand
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.000]   whether you're helping or hurting somebody?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.200]   - Well, I would look at a little bit of history.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   I would look at what the expectations are going forward.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.760]   Certainly health and mental condition
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.920]   are all factors that I would look at.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.920]   And then that would determine the timing of these,
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.240]   of the gifting.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.040]   It could occur while the parents are still here
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.440]   and sort of a dry run to see how that would happen.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.280]   It might have to occur after they're gone
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.400]   because they need the money currently.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.080]   So I would tell you every situation is quite, quite different
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.880]   but what determines it I think is mostly history,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   personality, what is their current occupation or profession?
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.440]   What is their, are they married, not married?
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.240]   Are they, what are their plans for their life?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.160]   - Let's talk about formal financial planning.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.560]   I'd love just for, if you're practicing in this area,
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.600]   you must have some interesting stories.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.800]   So think back over the last couple of years of your practice
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.320]   and choose for me perhaps a very interesting case
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.000]   that you worked on where clients came to you,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.240]   started talking through this process.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.920]   You did your fact-finding process
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.320]   and then you put together a financial plan
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.320]   using the tools of financial planning.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.800]   Describe the case, describe the scenario
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.120]   and describe the solution.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.480]   And please don't be scared to be specific
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.760]   with technical details.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   My audience is interested in that topic.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   - Sure, let me tell you, let's call him Joe, okay?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   So Joe was someone that showed up at one of our,
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.520]   we do donor workshops for charities and Joe showed up
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.480]   and he was what I would call a modest donor,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.400]   at least in the pyramid that the charity had.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.760]   He was not one of their top benefactors
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.120]   and he came and heard some things about
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.440]   how he might do some charitable planning
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.680]   and what it meant, what it would mean to him.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.400]   And he decided to take some action.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.720]   He changed the beneficiary on his IRA.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   He changed the beneficiaries in his will
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.120]   and he had some stock and made a charitable contribution
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.200]   to a trust, to a charitable remainder trust
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.560]   and got a tax deduction for that.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.120]   Increased his income currently by about 20 to 25%,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.680]   somewhere in there.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.040]   And as a result of that, he was able to double the gift
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.600]   that he was making to the institution.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.480]   In this case, it was a hospital.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.840]   So I always tell charities, you know, if you do it right,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.960]   you can increase current giving with planned giving.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.480]   And that was a perfect example.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.680]   Joe died a couple of years later, the children showed up
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.280]   and this was a while back when the tax laws
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.120]   were a little bit different.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.360]   And, you know, they were very interested
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   in why Joe had made these gifts to,
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   it was to the hospital, to his church and to his school.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.120]   And as a matter of fact, the gift to the hospital
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.520]   was over $900,000.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.320]   It was the largest gift they had received.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.480]   - These were gifts as given
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.800]   as part of the estate distribution
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.640]   or these were gifts, lifetime gifts?
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.080]   - Yes, exactly right.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.880]   That's exactly right.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.640]   During the estate distribution.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.040]   So the children, as you might imagine,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.160]   question the motivation behind this.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.040]   They felt maybe they were out a million dollars
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.120]   in inheritance.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.240]   And so we sat down and we showed them a before and after.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   And as it turns out,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.320]   they actually received more inheritance
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.120]   than they would have before
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.560]   because of the leverage that was obtained
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   from the tax deduction and the fact that that was used
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   to make some other inter-family transactions.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.400]   And they actually came out about 30% better
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.680]   in their inheritance.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.560]   The charities received about a million dollars.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.360]   Well, I think it was a million three total.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.240]   And the only loser in this deal, of course, was the IRS.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.400]   And that's a concrete example.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   I use a good bit, both with families and with charities
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.480]   to help them understand
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.480]   that the tax leverage can be tremendous.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.520]   It can benefit the individual.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.320]   In this case, Joe got more income, got a tax deduction.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.520]   It benefit the family.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.840]   They got more inheritance and it can benefit the charity.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   - Explain the tools involved.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.400]   Did he set up, did he give,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.120]   what did he give, when did he give it,
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.800]   and why did he use those tools?
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.720]   - It was charitable remainder trust,
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.440]   primarily to produce more income and a tax deduction.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.720]   There were gifts through will and IRA.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.600]   And there was a trust that was set up
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.800]   for the benefit of the family,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.320]   into which he put in some life insurance
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.080]   as a result of the tax deduction
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.120]   that was obtained from the gifts.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.240]   There was more discretionary income
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.760]   that he could use and replace to the family.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.240]   Those gifts that were going to go to charity.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.960]   - So let's walk through-- - Through the life insurance.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.400]   - Perfect, that's exactly what I was hoping.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.240]   And I know normally you're not accustomed
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.400]   to talking about necessarily the technical details,
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.800]   but it's of interest to my audience here.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.520]   So what is a charitable remainder trust?
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.360]   How does it work and what did it do for Joe
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.680]   and what did it do for the charity?
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.280]   - Okay, Joe transfers stock into the trust.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.120]   He names the charity as the beneficiary at his desk.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.600]   - This was stock, publicly traded stock
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.880]   or stock of his own private company?
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.400]   - Publicly traded stock with very low dividends.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.800]   - Okay.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   - So under 1% at the time.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.040]   - Appreciated stock? - Transfers that in.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.520]   - Sorry. - Yes, appreciated stock,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.480]   low cost basis.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.640]   So if he sold it, he was very reluctant
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.880]   to sell it and pay the tax.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.800]   Kind of a classic, what you look for
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.920]   in these types of transactions.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.040]   So he transfers the stock into the trust,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.760]   gets a tax deduction.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.360]   This is a function of his age, life expectancy,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.680]   and the amount that he's putting in.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.920]   So he gets a handsome tax deduction for that,
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.100]   current tax deduction.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:53.280]   Now the trust can sell that stock without paying any tax,
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   reinvest those proceeds into some income-producing
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.000]   property, stocks, bonds, whatever they happen to be,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.360]   and produce more income for Joe.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   So now Joe's income has gone up by 20, 25%.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.320]   He got a tax deduction in the front end.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.520]   So those are the benefits to Joe.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.520]   - And let me clarify, the reason why that's permitted
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.020]   is because this is a charitable remainder trust.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.000]   So the remainder of the account will transfer
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.800]   to the charity at the time of Joe's death.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.240]   - At his death.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.680]   Okay, so now you disinherited the children
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.480]   by that amount of money.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.680]   In order to replace that--
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.920]   - Real quick, Patrick, do you remember,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.640]   or are you willing to say about how much he put in
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.740]   and about how much his income was from it?
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.280]   - There was, oh, jeez, I'm trying to remember.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.120]   - Ballpark.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.600]   - Yeah, I think the trust was in the neighborhood
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.680]   of $900,000.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   And the income would have been in the 35 to 40,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.140]   which is substantially more than it was before.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.840]   Does that answer the question?
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.680]   - Yes, it does.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.440]   And the reason I'm probing on this is often,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.840]   so the world of estate planning,
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.600]   we've done a good job as financial advisors
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.480]   of trying to keep a sense of mystique here.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.680]   We feel it's one of those ways where we try to
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.040]   pretend we're better than everybody
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.480]   'cause we know how to do estate planning.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.440]   But I wanna demonstrate to people
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.160]   that it's very accessible.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.000]   And certainly you don't need to have $100 million
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.960]   to do good estate planning.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.720]   Sometimes, if you're dealing with a couple million bucks
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.000]   or somewhere in that modest seven-figure range,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.440]   you can still use some of these tools and strategies
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   to substantial effect.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.760]   That's why I'm asking for the details
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.600]   to demonstrate that to my audience.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   - Sure, sure, and if we have time,
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.200]   I'll give you a very simple one
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.520]   after we talk about this.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.320]   But now you have a tax deduction,
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.880]   you have increased income.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   So Joe increased his current giving to the charity.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.600]   The fact that he got a tax deduction and increased income
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.480]   allowed him to fund a life insurance policy into a trust.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.640]   And the reason you would do the trust
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.280]   is to keep it out of the estate.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:15.040]   And so you replace the lost inheritance
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.480]   with the life insurance, which is now in a trust
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.120]   and does not get taxed at all in terms of the state taxes.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.800]   And that goes to the children.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.480]   It has replaced the wealth that is going to the charity.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.040]   So who's benefited here?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.160]   Joe has benefited from increased income
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.880]   and less taxes to pay.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.760]   The children have benefited in that it actually,
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   he replaced the insurance was more than
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.320]   what the inheritance was going to be.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.240]   So that he was afforded that opportunity
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.520]   because of the tax deduction and the increased income.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.600]   And then the charity received the million dollars
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.480]   at his death, million three at his death.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.960]   So to me, it's a win, win, win.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:09.040]   Obviously Joe was charitably inclined.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.480]   He came to the workshop because he was a donor.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.640]   So there was motivation there to begin with.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.600]   - And yeah, and so the reason we go through it in detail
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.280]   is because it demonstrates how by locating,
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.000]   by looking at an asset structure,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.440]   and it's impossible to teach,
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.720]   the reason the scenarios are useful
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.120]   is you can't teach this subject and say,
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.040]   well, you should always do this
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.440]   because you have to look at the asset.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.120]   If you have, for example, okay,
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.440]   if the stock is privately held versus publicly held,
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.400]   that's gonna make a difference.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.080]   If it's appreciated stock,
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.720]   if he has a low tax basis in it,
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.880]   he paid a little bit of money and now it's worth a lot,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.280]   that's very different than if it's depreciated stock.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.080]   He paid a lot of money for it and now it's not worth much.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.800]   So in that situation,
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.520]   you would never put that asset into a trust.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.480]   You'd sell that asset.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.280]   And if you wanted to convey some money to the charity,
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.320]   you would always sell it,
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.520]   take the loss and then transfer it.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.080]   So these scenarios I think are useful
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   to demonstrate to the interested lay person
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.720]   that here are some actual techniques
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.360]   and everybody wins in that scenario.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.480]   Joe gets more money.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.280]   He fulfills his charitable goals, which are important.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.000]   The charity gets more giving now
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.280]   and more money at the termination of the trust.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.980]   The children have their inheritance secured
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.680]   and they get more money.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.400]   And then the financial advisor wins
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.120]   and provides a valuable service
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.840]   and you earn money on the transaction.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.680]   But everybody wins.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.600]   The only person that loses is the IRS,
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.520]   but I don't feel so bad about that.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.360]   I feel pretty good about that.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.120]   - Well, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.680]   I think most people would agree with you.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.720]   - So is there anything else we can learn
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.320]   from Joe's example before you go on
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.520]   to the other example you mentioned?
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.320]   - Well, I think what you can learn is that
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.940]   in most cases,
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.940]   people are not aware of techniques
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:07.940]   that would increase and benefit them,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.000]   increase their financial wellbeing and benefit them
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.720]   only because no one has brought it to their attention.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.800]   And if you have been around for a while,
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.640]   you know as well as I do,
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   that many people feel that their situation is well in hand.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.080]   They've done some planning.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.320]   They don't need any more.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.460]   They're resistant to having someone take another look.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.840]   But in most cases,
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.800]   if they haven't been exposed to some of these techniques,
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.320]   they're really doing themselves a disservice, I feel.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   And I can tell you there are numerous cases
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.180]   where we've reviewed documents that were outdated
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.180]   in terms of what clients thought their desires
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:06.240]   were reflected in these estate documents
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.780]   were not the case for various reasons.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.700]   - Right, and I know for me,
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.600]   people often build these barriers
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.200]   because frankly, as a financial advice community,
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.520]   many of us have abused,
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.120]   people have felt abused by us,
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.240]   we who are financial advisors.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.480]   And in the scenario that you explained,
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.000]   there's the appropriate placement
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.120]   of an appropriate life insurance policy.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.440]   And so what a new financial advisor
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.080]   or a new insurance agent would do is say,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.480]   "Listen, let me tell you about the islet.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.120]   "Let me tell you about how an islet,
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.780]   "an irrevocable life insurance trust works
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.620]   "and looks so great,
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.600]   "and you can put a life insurance policy in there."
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.480]   But a new life insurance agent
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.720]   is not gonna know how to structure
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.920]   a charitable remainder trust
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.080]   and is not gonna have the connection.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.440]   So what happens is that we who are new in the business,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.680]   we go out and burn a bunch of bridges for people
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.880]   and they don't wanna hear about it.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.920]   And then they gotta come along down the road and say,
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.740]   "Well, listen, okay, hold on a second.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.580]   "Let's talk about a specific situation.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.880]   "Let's run some math and let's see if there's a way
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.960]   "that we can use these various techniques
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.840]   "and tools that are at our disposal in an intelligent way."
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.660]   And in the example that you gave,
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.140]   it's not the life insurance policy that did the magic.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.680]   That's just one way of assuring the estate for the kids
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.200]   within that trust.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.800]   And the reason the life insurance policy works so well
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.480]   in that example is because Joe already gave away
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.320]   all the money.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.720]   He put the money, or he gave away a lot of money,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.680]   and he gave that away into the charity.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.720]   But with a life insurance policy,
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.840]   he just needs to buy some money
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.000]   to transfer to his kids at the date of death.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.240]   And within an irrevocable trust,
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.320]   he can go ahead and make the transfers in there
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.960]   that are sufficient to pay the premiums,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.440]   and he can buy some more money for his kids
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.400]   with the use of the life insurance policy.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.120]   But it only worked because of the other
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.840]   offsetting tax savings.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.100]   And so that's why when I, frankly, I mean,
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.960]   Patrick, the reason you're on
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.200]   is because you're working in this area,
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.880]   and this is the type of conversation
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.280]   I have been wanting to expose
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.580]   the radical personal finance community to,
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.560]   and I haven't.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.840]   Too many financial advisors are stuck
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.000]   behind their compliance department.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.600]   They can't come on and talk about these things.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.480]   So I think it's valuable that we can share this
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.600]   with people in a useful format.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.840]   - Well, Joshua, you make a good point.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.400]   I think that what happens is in so many cases
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   is that advisors lead with techniques
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.900]   and before they really have a full grasp of the situation.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.900]   And it's so helpful to know everything
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.620]   that you possibly can about that client
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.540]   or potential client, including reviewing
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.260]   tax returns and documents.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.260]   But even more importantly than that,
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.500]   what are their desires?
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.420]   What do they really want to accomplish in life?
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:54.420]   And once that communication develops,
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.140]   then these techniques just kind of fall into place.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.460]   - Right.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.020]   - And you don't need to, like you say,
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.740]   hammer on an eyelet.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.140]   It may be appropriate, it may not.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.980]   In this context, it was, because as you mentioned,
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.460]   some money was freed up, and I liked what you said
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.020]   about buying some money.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.140]   That's exactly what happened here.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.780]   - Yeah, and Joe was insurable.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.980]   I mean, if Joe hadn't been insurable,
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.820]   it wouldn't have worked.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.460]   He'd have to find another solution.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.900]   It doesn't mean that there's not an option.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.020]   It just might mean you're transferring a policy
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.420]   that's elsewhere or you're using another technique.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.300]   - Absolutely, there may be one, yeah.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.700]   If there's an existing, you always want to take
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.940]   the lowest cost option.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.780]   - Amen.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.300]   - And if there is one already existing,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.780]   restructure what is already available.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.940]   - Yeah, give us that next example, Patrick.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:51.460]   - Okay, so you don't have to have tens of millions
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.460]   of dollars, a colleague of mine who works
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.940]   in the planned giving area at the charity
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.900]   has told me over the years that one of his favorite
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:10.900]   situations is to find one of their donors who is elderly,
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:17.380]   who is single, and either widowed or never married woman,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.700]   who has an interest in the charity,
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.980]   owns a home and has an IRA.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.980]   And he talks to them about donating the home currently.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.540]   You can donate your home, live in it for the rest
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.620]   of your life, retain an interest to live in it
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.340]   for the rest of your life, get a current tax deduction
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.620]   for this gift of the home.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.720]   And even if you're in the lowest tax bracket,
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   15% tax bracket or so, this gives you a tax deduction
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.060]   that would allow you to take more money out of the IRA
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.980]   without paying tax on it.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.940]   So it accomplishes very much what a Roth IRA would
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.920]   if you were to take withdrawals without having
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.460]   to do the conversion and pay the tax.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.760]   So that's a very simple example.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   There are a lot of people out there with a house and an IRA.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.060]   And if they don't have beneficiaries,
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.860]   this is a technique that works pretty well
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.940]   in those cases where they're gonna live there
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.140]   for probably the rest of their life.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.020]   They can get the current tax deduction,
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.580]   the charity gets the home, and they can increase
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.740]   their income and maybe go take a trip as a result.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.620]   - And then, yeah, it's a good example.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.060]   What is the mechanism?
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.300]   Would you donate the house to the IRA
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.280]   and retain a lease?
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.280]   What's the mechanism that you would use?
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.060]   - You donate, yeah, life interest.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.340]   You donate the house to the charity, retain a life interest.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.000]   - And a life interest for the layperson is a legal right
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.140]   to live in the property for the duration of your life.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.120]   - That is correct.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.980]   - Let's talk through, in your book,
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.800]   you provide just a few pages where you talk
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.040]   about the sampling of strategies.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.660]   Just wanna talk through these at a high level.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.560]   Tell me about what a charitable gift annuity is
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.580]   and how it works.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.980]   - If you're familiar with a commercial annuity
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.900]   where you just transfer money in return for an income
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   and get a current tax deduction,
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.740]   you don't get a current tax deduction
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.780]   in a commercial annuity with an insurance company.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.780]   This would simply be the same concept,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.580]   only the charity would act as the insurance company.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.380]   They would guarantee you an income
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.680]   for the rest of your life.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.720]   You would make a donation of,
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.160]   let's just use a simple example
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.860]   where you donate $100,000
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:01.680]   and maybe you get $5,000 for the rest of your life.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   You might get a 15 or $20,000 current income tax deduction,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.080]   depending on your age.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:14.080]   And the charity would guarantee that income for you
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.360]   or you and another beneficiary,
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.280]   typically a spouse, for the rest of your life.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.680]   Given low interest rate environment we're in,
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.360]   many times this is an attractive option
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.920]   for people that are in their advanced years,
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.620]   need more income,
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.320]   and could benefit from the tax deduction as well.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.360]   - Tell me about the pros and cons
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.880]   of leaving my retirement plan to charity.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.620]   - Well, I would tell you that the pros are pretty strong.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.240]   The retirement plan is subject
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.600]   to both income tax and estate tax.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   And one of the advantages of leaving the IRA,
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.920]   there are two options today.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.880]   One is you can leave it at your death.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.080]   That would avoid the estate tax
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.240]   if you're in a state taxable area.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.840]   And it would certainly avoid the income tax
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   on those distributions.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.160]   Your beneficiaries are going to have to take that money out
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.800]   and it will be taxed.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.540]   So it'll avoid all of that.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:30.160]   So it's one of the best assets to give away.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.560]   I would tell you that it is preferable in many cases
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.020]   to naming a charity in your will.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:41.840]   So a very easy thing to do to just add charity to your IRA.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.080]   Also, we now have clarification
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.120]   on what's called the charitable IRA,
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.880]   which is if you're over 70 and a half
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.600]   and you're taking what are your required
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.020]   and minimum distributions,
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.200]   you can make a gift to charity
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   and it will satisfy that required minimum distribution
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.560]   to the amount, up to the amount that you give.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.200]   And it will not affect your adjusted gross income.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.480]   Now that's a small item that a lot of people miss,
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:18.080]   but it will not, if you were to take the money out first,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.440]   it would increase your adjustable gross income.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.600]   And then you make contribution to charity,
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.960]   it would not be as effective as doing the charitable IRA
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.760]   directly to the charity from your IRA.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.020]   And that's a current gift while you're alive.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.600]   - What's a donor advised fund
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.400]   and why should I consider using one?
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.960]   - Donor advised fund is set up by either a charity
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.440]   and today the largest ones are financial institutions.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.560]   Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab are the three largest
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.640]   donor advised funds.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.520]   The advantage is you make a gift today
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.540]   to the donor advised fund,
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.200]   and then you can later designate the beneficiaries
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:08.080]   that would receive these gifts and the timing of them.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.660]   This is used a lot when you have an event,
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.200]   like a sale of a business,
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.900]   or I don't know too many people that have won the lottery,
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.240]   but if you were to come into Sudden Wealth
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.720]   and you needed a tax deduction today
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.840]   and you were charitably inclined,
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.520]   you could make this contribution into the donor advised fund
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.800]   and then take your time deciding
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.460]   which charities would benefit.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.960]   No full well though that this is a gift.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.360]   You are getting a tax deduction today,
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.160]   but ultimately this money is going to charity.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.200]   - Right, and let's just hammer that point home.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.760]   A lot of people might be thinking,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.880]   well, there's some way that I can manipulate this system.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.020]   After all, I've heard if I just set up a trust
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.280]   then I get tax advantages, and of course a trust,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.800]   I can control that, so the answer is no.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.520]   The law is very clear.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.440]   When you get a deduction,
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.080]   it's because you have abandoned your control of the money.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.060]   You've made a legitimate bona fide gift.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.200]   So at the foundation of your planning,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.640]   you've got to have that as an intention.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.840]   Now, of course, there are some techniques
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.840]   that can be implemented to allow you to make sure
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.400]   that your goals are furthered.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.960]   You can write a trust document in a way
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.640]   that's gonna get you much closer,
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.320]   but you are actually giving money away.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   You've gotta actually give it away,
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.360]   and that is going to be an irrevocable transfer.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.720]   So some techniques and tools give you
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.420]   a little bit more control than others,
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.800]   but you are giving money away.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.120]   You can't just, these are not games that we're playing here,
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   just making stuff up.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.920]   It's a proven out, developed body of work
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.520]   where, yes, you can leverage the money,
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.280]   but you're actually giving it away.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.360]   - That's exactly right.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.960]   Finally, as far as technique,
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.680]   and then we'll go back to big picture.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.600]   So I've got a life insurance policy,
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.040]   and I'm sitting here looking at this thing saying,
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.440]   well, I don't really need it,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   and my wife doesn't need it, my kids don't need it.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.800]   What should I do with this thing?
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.760]   Talk to me about the idea
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.560]   of using that life insurance policy.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.320]   - Sure, I think this is one of the most
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.680]   overlooked areas there is.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.160]   There are plenty of folks out there
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.120]   that took out a life insurance policy
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.400]   when they were maybe younger
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.240]   and had a mortgage and children to educate
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.840]   and a spouse to take care of
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.320]   if they stepped out of the picture
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.880]   and they paid on this for years and years and years,
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.120]   and now they're older, they have some wealth.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.280]   There's not a need for the insurance
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.960]   for any income replacement.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.520]   There's not a need for the insurance
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.780]   to pay any estate taxes, for example.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.920]   A gift to that insurance policy to a charity
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   is, I think, a tremendous leverageable tool,
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.160]   and the reason I say that is
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.400]   you get a current tax deduction
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.080]   for whatever value is in that policy,
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.200]   typically cash value that's in that policy,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.360]   and that's a shortcut.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.680]   There's something a little more complicated to that.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.520]   - You don't wanna talk about
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.480]   the interpolated terminal reserve?
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.760]   - Yeah, I don't wanna talk
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.840]   about the interpolated terminal reserve,
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.080]   but you do have to get a qualified opinion on it
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:31.080]   and make sure that your CPA understands
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:35.760]   that what that is and is willing to sign the tax return
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.960]   for that value.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.160]   There's not huge risk in this,
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.120]   but there is some difference of opinion from time to time,
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:48.540]   so you do have to get that analysis performed,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.000]   but once you do that, you get that full tax deduction.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.600]   You can either continue paying premiums
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.320]   if that's what you wanna do.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.480]   You can gift an equivalent amount
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.920]   of the premium to the charity.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.740]   They can pay the premium.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.400]   We know for sure everyone's going to die,
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.800]   so there will be a point in time
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.880]   when the charity will benefit from this,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.040]   or you can just take a paid-up policy.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.460]   The charity can take a paid-up policy and just wait.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:24.120]   Now, the charity can also access those cash values
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.080]   if they want to, but typically, that's beyond your control
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.180]   and really not something that would affect you,
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:35.280]   but I think this is one of the areas
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.800]   that is overlooked both by charities and individuals.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.600]   A lot of people just cancel their policy.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.480]   They pay a lot of tax.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.440]   The net effect is not as good as if they donated it.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.620]   - Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.260]   This is a particular passion of mine.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.420]   One of the reasons I started Radical Personal Finance
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.840]   was I got sick and tired of hearing financial pundits say,
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.480]   "Bob, you have a whole life insurance policy.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.980]   "Just cancel that thing."
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.860]   I got tired of screaming at whatever radio or speaker
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.920]   I was hearing and saying, "You are stupid.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.780]   "That is absolutely the wrong advice.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.440]   "Stop and look and find out if there's a way,
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.060]   "something effective and efficient that can be done."
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:18.060]   I mean, you get a nice, healthy policy
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.040]   and exactly what you said, you transfer it to a charity.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.420]   Let's say you continue to pay the premiums.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:24.500]   Now you've turned your premiums
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.700]   from a non-deductible expenditure
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.160]   to a deductible expenditure.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.360]   You've received a deduction for the value of the policy,
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.060]   the cash value or the ITR.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.180]   The charity has the, if they need the money,
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.140]   of course, they could always cash it out
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.100]   or they could even just use it as a form of collateral.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.340]   They could take a loan against it.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.180]   They could pledge some of the cash value.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.860]   Now you might be able to take a charity
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.620]   from a poorly funded charity
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.500]   and now they know they've got a solid asset behind them
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.020]   that could be a sizable asset.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.060]   And then the board of directors there
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.180]   could possibly take that leverage ability
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.140]   and use it to leverage their own finances
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:07.140]   by having such a healthy asset backing up their plans.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.500]   And then at the end of the day, it's gonna pay out.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.680]   I mean, it's a really under-talked about option.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.300]   And I get, yeah.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.780]   So what you just went over is exactly the reason
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.220]   why I started Radical Personal Finance
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.260]   'cause I got sick and tired of people not,
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.660]   who didn't know how to use some of these techniques,
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.180]   not discussing them in public.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:30.220]   - Well, I tell you, it's refreshing to hear someone
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.220]   that feels the same way I do about this.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:35.160]   This is one of those well-kept secrets.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:40.100]   And a lot of people make a mistake in this area
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.780]   only because they don't get advice about it.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:47.660]   And just, as you say, go ahead and cash it in
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.300]   and that's the last option.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.300]   I think, you know, unless you're in dire financial straits,
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.820]   I think these other options,
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:03.820]   especially the charitable one, is very, very dynamic.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.340]   - Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.700]   Patrick, let's go back big picture.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.740]   What have you learned about your own finances
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.780]   and your own plans for your money
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.580]   since starting to work more heavily
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.020]   with clients in this space?
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:23.540]   - Well, I guess the process has been one of,
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.740]   it even goes back to, you know, my father
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.060]   and some of the values he taught me.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.500]   He was a very conservative guy
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.620]   and was an accountant by background.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.620]   But even with that, I found out later
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.140]   that there were some things that if I would have had
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.940]   the opportunity, I could have helped him a great deal,
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.580]   enhance his wealth more than he did.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:56.140]   He did okay, but he could have done really well.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.020]   So it starts with that.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:03.020]   And I vowed to study enough about this area.
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:07.980]   It attracted me such that I could take advantage
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.540]   of that knowledge and not make some mistakes
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:16.540]   and continue to build wealth and live a good life.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:22.580]   And once I got to a point where that looked
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:28.460]   like it was pretty assured, I would devote myself
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.540]   to what I'm doing now, which is pretty much
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.980]   helping charities thrive financially.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.260]   I think it's important that they grow
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.260]   their endowment reserve funds so that they're around
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.620]   and a great example was in 2000, 2001,
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:50.460]   and again, 2008, nine, those charities that had reserves
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:55.460]   that could call on those funds did fine.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.740]   They were able to meet payroll.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.540]   They were able to make some expansion plans
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.180]   and see those through.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.820]   So I would tell you what I've learned is that, you know,
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.260]   with a little bit of knowledge, well-applied,
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.860]   it can do an awful lot of good in a lot of places.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.100]   - I have a lot of financial advisors who listen to my show
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.540]   and I receive many emails from people
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.180]   who have either thought about or have become
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.100]   financial advisors because of radical personal finance.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.780]   I'd like you to share, what was your path
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.700]   through this industry to where you are today?
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.060]   Where did you start?
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.100]   What were the career turns that led to your current practice?
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.860]   - I came out of graduate school,
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.380]   was hired by a life insurance company,
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.140]   went to work in their home office.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:45.820]   And my job was to, what was called advanced underwriting.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:50.500]   I worked with agents that would go out on a death claim
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.220]   and we had bought a Boston money manager
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.580]   and I would design the investment plan
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.940]   for the widow and the children
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.940]   so they could continue to live in what was a lifestyle
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.500]   they were accustomed to.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:10.260]   Also, we had some Fortune 100 companies
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.220]   that had their executives.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:18.220]   We counseled their executives in the use of stock options
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:24.060]   and retirement plans and how to tactically use
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.860]   what was available in those days
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:31.420]   to help them get to a retirement
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.300]   where they would live a comfortable retirement.
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.820]   So after a few years of that,
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.300]   there was a company in Atlanta that I met some of the people,
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.380]   they hired me away.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.060]   I came to Atlanta, worked with them for a while,
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.220]   met my two future partners there.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.780]   We left after a few years,
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.020]   they were having financial difficulty, we were not.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:02.020]   And we started a firm and for 25 years grew that,
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.740]   became very successful.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.660]   And then back in 2000,
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:13.020]   I decided that I would sort of downsize my life,
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.220]   if you will.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:18.220]   It's fun running a firm with 30 people
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.180]   and growing assets,
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.260]   but you kind of get away from what you love
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:29.340]   and you spend a lot of time in administration
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:33.340]   and HR issues with folks.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:38.340]   And so now I've got four people and we have 65 clients
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:45.140]   and it's very manageable and I really enjoy what I'm doing.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:45.980]   - How old are you now?
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.620]   - I've enjoyed all of them, I've enjoyed all of them,
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.100]   but I really enjoy what I'm doing now.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.220]   - How old are you now?
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.380]   - I am gonna be 69 on Saturday.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.780]   - Congratulations.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.020]   Do you intend to retire?
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.060]   - I don't.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:06.260]   It's a wonderful business in that
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.260]   it's very much a lifestyle business.
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:13.300]   I played four days of golf at a golf tournament
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.940]   at a resort last week.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:20.820]   I go on trips whenever I want to,
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:24.020]   I've got a great staff, they're very tolerant of that.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.860]   We've got great clients.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:32.340]   So it's a wonderful lifestyle business,
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.900]   but it also turns me on enough
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.060]   that I wanna continue doing it as long as I'm able.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:43.060]   And I think I'm still sharp enough
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:47.620]   that I can do it, I'm healthy.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.620]   So as long as that continues, I'd like to continue working.
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:55.660]   Retirement for me is not attractive.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.740]   I like doing it two or three or four days at a time,
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.460]   but not forever.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.260]   - In working with your client base,
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.220]   who's in probably an age range,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.980]   bracketing yours by 10 years below and 10 years above
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:15.580]   if the normal experience of a financial advisory practice
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.980]   is applicable, what have you seen,
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.980]   have you traced any threads of retirement
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.340]   from those that you've watched retire?
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.220]   Have you found that most of your clients
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.020]   who've been able to retire haven't wanted to?
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.220]   Have you found that some of them
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.540]   have been very enthusiastic about it?
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.260]   What have you learned about retirement
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.700]   from watching your clients?
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:39.860]   - I'll tell you what I learned from actually a client of mine
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.380]   spouse of a client.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.740]   She said, we always have the conversation
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.820]   about how long am I going to work?
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:51.340]   And I have young people here
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.900]   that work with the next generation
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:58.900]   and also give some comfort like you were referring to
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:03.660]   when you were in your thirties working with retired people
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   or those about to retire,
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.420]   they're comfortable working with younger people
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.820]   'cause they know they're going to be around.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.420]   So I have that here,
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:15.980]   but here's one thing I learned that the more I see this,
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.420]   the more right she is.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.500]   And she said, what I have found
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.100]   is that people that work for themselves
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.140]   typically don't want to retire.
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:30.980]   People that work for a large corporation,
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.740]   a financial institution,
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.540]   where someone else is making decisions for them
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.460]   and telling them where they need to be on Wednesday
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:43.700]   and their metrics they have to meet,
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.940]   no such things.
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:49.460]   Those people are anxious to and really enjoy retirement.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.060]   And I've seen that played out more
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.020]   ever since she said that.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.460]   I've been very aware of that.
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.460]   I will tell you most of the ones that I have
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.300]   that love retirement,
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.820]   don't do anything but play golf, work out
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.220]   and go out to dinner
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.740]   are those that work for large corporations.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:12.620]   - Yeah, my own anecdotal experience more limited than yours
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.580]   would corroborate that.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.220]   That's why I think that the simplest way to retire
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:21.060]   is simply first get control of your life with your own,
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.820]   get a little bit of autonomy
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.340]   over your daily comings and goings.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.860]   And all of a sudden you think to yourself,
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.220]   well, this is what I wanted.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.700]   This is what I was after.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.660]   Even just going from managing 30 people
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.420]   to managing four people.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.980]   I mean, you would have, my guess, feel free to disagree,
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.980]   but if you were still trying to manage an office of 30 people
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.820]   and you're trying to meet growth targets
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.500]   and you're trying to expand from 30 to 60,
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.180]   that wouldn't be nearly as fun as you're having,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.380]   as much fun as you're having now.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.900]   And you'd be much more likely to wanna hang up your hat
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.620]   and turn in your calculator.
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.980]   - I think you're right.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.780]   I think there's a big difference
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:01.900]   the farther you get removed from the client contact.
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:03.860]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:07.660]   Patrick, when you look at the financial advice business
[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:10.860]   with 30 years of exposure,
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:12.860]   are you optimistic about some of the trends?
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.380]   Are there things that concern you?
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.780]   What's your perspective on the overall industry?
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.660]   - I would say I'm optimistic.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:25.660]   I would say that because there are more people
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:30.620]   with more wealth, there are more challenges.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:36.340]   I can tell you that every year I've been in this business,
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:41.340]   I can always reference the recently changed tax laws.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.660]   You can make that statement every year
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:48.060]   because Congress meets every two years.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:53.060]   They either tweak or totally change tax laws.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.620]   That's always a challenge.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.620]   So what was done five years ago
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.740]   is not appropriate today, perhaps.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.820]   So that keeps it interesting
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:07.540]   and makes it worthwhile to engage in financial planning.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:10.060]   And I think this whole issue of transfer
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:13.140]   to the next generation,
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:17.260]   this current generation is the richest
[00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.700]   that ever existed on the planet
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.180]   in terms of per capita wealth.
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.980]   And it's a worldwide phenomenon.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.820]   And how they go about that
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.180]   and some of the issues we talked about earlier
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:36.060]   about what's an appropriate amount for children
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.100]   and how do you train them up
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.980]   to be good stewards of this money,
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:44.260]   all of that I think offers continuing
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:47.500]   and even expanding opportunity for financial planning.
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.660]   - Patrick, tell us, so you're in Atlanta.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.060]   Go ahead and tell us about your firm, your book.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.700]   Do you work with clients across the country?
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.860]   So if anyone's interested,
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.740]   go ahead and share how they can get in touch with you
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.540]   if they're interested in engaging with you.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.180]   - Sure, I'm in Atlanta.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:06.580]   It's Ren Wealth Management, R-E-N-N
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.900]   is the way you spell my last name.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:12.620]   And there is a website, renwealth.com.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.620]   Also, the book is entitled
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.260]   "Finding Your Money's Greater Purpose."
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.100]   And there is a website, Money's Greater Purpose.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.540]   And if you visit that website,
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:26.020]   you'll see some information about the book, about me.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.460]   You can download a free chapter.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.900]   You can get in touch with me by email.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.220]   You can join our mailing list
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.980]   and I'll periodically update you on items
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.220]   that I feel are important.
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.140]   But those are the two main methods,
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.580]   renwealth.com and moneysgreaterpurpose.com.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.580]   - I hope that you can see the value
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.780]   that a good financial advisor can bring in a situation.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.900]   I encourage you, if you are in a stage,
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.660]   I'm happy to help good guys.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.420]   I can't personally endorse Patrick.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.700]   All I know from him is,
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.860]   of him is what you heard on the interview.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.460]   But he certainly sounds competent to me.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.180]   If you're in the Atlanta area,
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.660]   that's where his practice is based,
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.900]   feel free to check with him.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.300]   Or if you want a consultation,
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.120]   he might be a good guy who can help you
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.260]   with some of your charitable needs.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.540]   My hope in profiling,
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.980]   I know many of you who listen to the show
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.740]   are younger financial advisors
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.900]   or who are people who aspire to be financial advisors.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.740]   And my hope on profiling Patrick today
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.740]   is to encourage you to focus on the actual value
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:31.020]   that you bring to a client.
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.340]   It's not just a matter of selling a product.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.500]   It's a matter of making a plan work.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.340]   And when you do it,
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.800]   you build these lifetime relationships
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.480]   that can just dramatically transform,
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.180]   you can transform people's lives.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.780]   And that's the cool side of the business.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.460]   It's tough to build,
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.780]   but once you're there,
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.700]   it can be a lot of fun.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.580]   Even as you hear Patrick's story,
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.900]   he's doing well and he's having fun.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.100]   And he's 69 years old and he doesn't want to retire.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.140]   And that to me is the dream life.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.700]   And notice what we talked about with retirement.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.620]   All those themes corroborated again.
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.460]   Never talked to Patrick before what you heard.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.260]   About 30 seconds before the interview,
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.380]   told him a little bit about me,
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.560]   and then we hit start.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.740]   I didn't even correspond with him.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.220]   I corresponded with his publicist.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.900]   But just notice the themes that we talk about
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.100]   on this show every day.
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.820]   Just jumping out from his vicarious experience
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.060]   with his clients.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.740]   And figure out how to apply them to your life.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.420]   Hope this interview has been useful to you.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.140]   Hope you've enjoyed it.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.180]   I intend if you were,
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.620]   if you got your mind lost
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.060]   by what is a charitable remainder trust,
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.260]   or what's a charitable lead trust,
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.200]   or what's a donor advised fund,
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:39.340]   I will, over the course of Radical Personal Finance,
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.020]   I will cover each of those topics in depth.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:44.420]   And some of you have been frustrated
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.740]   with the paucity of in-depth financial planning
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.620]   discussions on the show.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.620]   I understand that.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.900]   I would like to have them back.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.500]   I like doing them.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.140]   I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.300]   And I've got to solve,
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.540]   I got to solve some of the back end things first.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.580]   Since I'm doing the best I can.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.220]   Those shows are very time consuming.
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.500]   I'm doing everything I can to get to them.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.460]   And I will get to them in the course of the show.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.740]   I promise you that.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.580]   If you want to support the show,
