[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   [music]
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, podcast number 16.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Today, my special guest is Cheryl Garrett.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Cheryl is an author and a financial planner
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and is the founder of the Garrett Planning Network,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   a network of over 230 hourly financial planners.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   [music]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My name is Rick Ferry and I'm the host of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Today, my special guest is Cheryl Garrett,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   the founder of the Garrett Planning Network,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   a nationwide network of over 230 hourly-based financial advisors
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   whose mission is to make competent, objective financial advice
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   accessible to all people.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I have known Cheryl for many years,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and I'm very happy to have her on the show today.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So with no further ado,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   let me introduce my good friend, Cheryl Garrett.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Thank you for being on the show, Cheryl.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Delighted to be here, Rick. Thank you.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I'm really excited to have you on the show.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We've known each other for 20 years,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   and you're just doing wonderful things out there
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   for investors in your organization.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   The Garrett Planning Network is just a fantastic organization
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   that I have personally been involved with for many years,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   almost since the beginning, I believe.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I'm really excited to talk with you today about the Garrett Network,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   but before we get into that,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   tell us a little bit about who is Cheryl Garrett.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I am a gal who grew up in the middle of the country,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Kansas, to be precise,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and I went to college not knowing really what I wanted to do for a living,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   but I found that I loved reading Money Magazine cover to cover,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and I was really into this concept of learning
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   about knowing how to manage my financial affairs.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I didn't know what it was called or anything,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   but I wanted to know about personal finance,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and I didn't want to have to have a husband or a father
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   or somebody doing that for me.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I wanted to know that stuff,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and I kind of was born an entrepreneur,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   or my father raised one, that's for sure.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   He was an entrepreneur as well,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and I had my first job when I was eight,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   working at a flower shop,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   a couple of backyards behind our house,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and so I got a good lesson of the value of money and work
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and fair dealings,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and my father grew up really, really poor
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and married a woman who had a car in high school,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   which was great.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So my father and his mother,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   both were just extraordinary role models,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and I live by a mantra,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   what would grandma do? My dad's mom.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   She raised nine kids,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   six of which were born living during the Depression in Kansas
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   with the Dust Bowl.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   She could make a meal for their whole family.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Literally, I think the rock soup story
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   began with my grandmother,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and I just carried this forward.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I wanted to do something that mattered in my work life
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   that made a difference,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   but I didn't have the interest to be a medical doctor.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I kept coming back to this love for learning
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   about personal finance,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and while I was still in college and working full time,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I actually met a woman who was a registered representative
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   for IDF, now Ameriprise Financial Advisors.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   - Of course, yes.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   - But I wanted to be able to control my own destiny
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   as much as reasonably possible,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and having the knowledge of personal finance
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   goes a long way to doing that,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and so I looked around.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I started noticing company names
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   and hearing about different financial advisors
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   or financial planners or investment advisors,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and I didn't know the difference between any of them,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and I was applying for jobs
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   at companies that said they were wanting to hire one,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and so I interviewed with a bunch of places.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Most of them were insurance companies
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   talking about financial planning
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   or investment advisor or financial advisor,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and I was offered a position in IDF, Ameriprise now.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It was a lot narrower then
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   as far as their spectrum of offering and so forth.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Actually, a lot of financial planners
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and advisors started at IDF.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's amazing.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   The only decent way into the industry
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   when you had nothing but maybe a semester of accounting
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   or a semester of economics or something.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Heck, there weren't investment classes in college.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You know, isn't that crazy?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   - But Cheryl, I mean,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   isn't that the way the industry still is?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I mean, you don't need to have a degree in finance
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   or you don't need to have any kind of special training
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   in order to take a Series 7 exam
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and become a registered rep at a brokerage firm, correct?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   - Oh, sure.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Anybody can be a salesperson
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   by passing the sales licenses.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's a transaction-based thing,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   and there is a very low bar of entry.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Unfortunately, there's also a very low bar of entry
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   to give fiduciary advice,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   the type of advice that could really harm
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   or make or break somebody's financial future.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   - What I always say is it's harder for your 16-year-old
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   to get a driver's license
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   than for someone to become a financial advisor
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   in the United States.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And let me explain.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   That 16-year-old who wants to get a driver's license
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   has to go through a series of classes.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Then they have to take a written exam and pass it,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   and then they have to get a learner's permit
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   where they're on this learner's permit
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   for, I don't know, six months or whatever it is
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   until they learn how to drive.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And then they have to take another practical driving test
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   to actually show that they are proficient
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   driving a vehicle.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   A financial advisor in the United States,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   they just have to pass an exam,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and that's it, one exam.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   - Yeah, and it's not all that difficult.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   - No, where I used to work in the brokerage industry
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   back 25 years ago,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   all of the people who were doing sales assistance,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   they weren't even brokers or advisors.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   They were the sales assistants to them
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   who were doing a lot of the administrative work.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   All of the sales assistants all had to take the exam
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and pass the exam.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So it was not a difficult exam.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Again, you maybe studied for a couple of months,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   and then you go in and you take the exam in the morning,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and you're done in the afternoon.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And now you are a full-fledged expert
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   as far as the public is concerned.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   - You could be vice president of something.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   - Oh, yeah, you could be vice president.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   That was another thing, too.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Everybody was a vice president.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It didn't matter.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Everybody was a vice president, yeah.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So in other words, the industry hasn't really changed at all
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   as far as getting into it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   But what you found when you got into that
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   was that it wasn't for you.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   - That's for sure.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   - And actually, I bounced around for 11 years
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   trying to find what was the right fit for me.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I worked at IDS, definitely not the right fit.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Then I went to work for a fee-only financial planner.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   It was more of a family office.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   We took care of 24 households.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I learned a lot, but that's not what made my heart sing.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   My next major role, I had a couple of similar types
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   of engagements with independent financial planning firms
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   to really learn holistic financial planning,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   complete my CFP education designation,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   and start working with and looking at the issues
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   that clients face.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   But all through this, at first I was dealing with
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   basically being a transaction salesperson
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   that I am not and can't be.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I miserably failed at it, but I wasn't going to give up hope
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   that there wasn't a better option out there
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   because I was in love with the concept.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And I bounced around three or four different positions
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   over the next 11 years trying to find a better fit,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   more client-focused, more appropriate
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   for what clients need, and more right fit.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   - What exactly was the right fit for you?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I mean, what were you looking for?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   - We don't need a full-time money manager
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   or a full-time advisor, but every once in a while
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   we need somebody we can trust to turn to.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And I wanted to be that outlet,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   to provide that same high quality of advice
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   that people who wanted to delegate
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and spend thousands of dollars a year
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   to financial firm, financial advisory firms.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   What about the rest of the people?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   The other, you know, 80% of the population?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Nobody other than the sales community
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   was even available to the middle market and the beginners.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And then nobody wants to deal with the do-it-yourselfers
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   because there's no long-term revenue.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   So I built my firm to charge by the hour
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   to do what people needed.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   - Well, let's get back to that concept
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   of making the jump from working for other companies
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   to this aha moment or this epiphany
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   where you decided that I need to go out
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   and create a network that does this.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   This is needed out there, it doesn't exist,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   and you decided you were the person to do it.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   - I decided to become the outlet
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   to provide financial advice
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   to these people who didn't have access before
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   because of minimums or asset under-management requirements.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And I started out my practice
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   11 years into financial planning,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   and I said, "How would I want financial advice
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   if I were the consumer?"
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I would want to walk in and say,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   "Rick, this is what I've got going on.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   What should I do?"
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And then you give me your advice,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   and I'd take it, and I'd run with it.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I felt that that was how I would want
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   to receive financial advice if I were the consumer,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   and so I built my financial planning firm that way.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   - And how did that come in, get your advice,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   go out and do it yourself, pay by the hour?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   How did that model go?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   How was it taken by the public?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   - Within a few months,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I started receiving a lot of traction.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   - So you're out there on your own now,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   and you're getting a lot of business
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   because there are very few financial planners.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   - None.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   - Right, none at the time,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   who are actually willing to get paid a fair wage
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   for actually doing financial planning
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and just doing financial planning
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and not deciding to sell you insurance
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   or manage your money.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   - Right, yeah.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   - I'm just doing financial planning.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   - Yeah, I set my rate based on the time
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I put into working with or on behalf of a client
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   instead of how big's your portfolio
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   or how tall are you or what's your BMI.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   You know, formulas never fit everybody every time,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   and I haven't found AUM to fit most people
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   most of the time, and I can't do that.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   So for me, the most fair way to charge,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   although it does put more onus on the advisor,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   is to charge for my time.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And also, one thing that I noticed
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   is nearly everyone that I worked with,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   my firm worked with probably about 1,000 households
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   when I was involved in the hourly practice,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and within one year, 15 months exactly,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I started getting a whole lot of industry press
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   about my hourly novelty or oddity or insanity.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   - I like the word insanity because
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   since I've been doing hourly,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   a lot of people think that I've gone insane too.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   - Yeah, and welcome to the club.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   - But it is hard.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   I mean, it's not easy money
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   like doing assets under management
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   is relatively easy money.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You get paid whether the market goes up or down,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   whether the client calls, whether the client doesn't call.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   I mean, you get your cut every single quarter.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So hourly is not easy.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   - As we're thinking about it,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   if you can't make a living
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   at whatever dollar an hour rate,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   you know, people will complain about
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   a service provider that charges $85 an hour
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   or $185 or $400 an hour, whatever.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   But if they fix your problem
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   for a price you're willing to pay, you're thrilled.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   - So you're doing hourly, the phone is ringing,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   you're getting busy,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   but then also the media
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   takes notice of what you're doing,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and boom, so the world kind of explodes on you.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   - When some journalists heard about what I was doing,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I started getting calls,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   and I started talking to journalists about what I did,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and it was pretty remarkable
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   'cause the first major journalist I recall tracking me down
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   was Liz Pulliam-Weston while she was at the LA Times,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   and she was working on an article
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   called "Middle Income Advisor,"
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and so she contacted her stable of go-to resources,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   and all of them said, "You know, that really wouldn't,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   you know, middle America really wouldn't be me,"
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and I'm not talking geographically,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I'm talking financially.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Liz said, "I contacted a number of my resources,"
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and they kept mentioning,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   "Have you talked to Cheryl in Kansas?"
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And to me, that's a punchline already.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   When somebody has to go 1,500 miles
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   to find one girl in Kansas that works by the hour,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I mean, there has got to be a joke in here somewhere.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   - No, that's true, though.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I mean, the whole industry,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   and most of it still is this way,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   is geared towards how can I make money off of your money?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I mean, both-- - Exactly.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   - The brokers who are selling-- - Oh, shit, you figured it out?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   - It's not about how to make money for you,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   it's how to make money from you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   That's the way that the brokerage firms were.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I mean, when I was in the brokerage world,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and I was there for 10 years at two different companies,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   one of them was Kidder Peabody,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   and the other one was Smith Barney,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   so these were not small companies.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Both of them are no longer in existence,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   but, you know, when I went in every year
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   for my annual meeting with my office manager,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   where we were setting goals
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   to determine what my goals would be,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   it wasn't how many clients are you gonna help
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   reach their financial goal this year?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   How are you going to help the clients
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   send their children to college?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   It wasn't anything like that.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It was how much commission revenue
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   are you gonna generate, and how are you gonna do it?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And they didn't really care how you did it.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   They really didn't.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   If you hit these goals that they had for you,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   then you got your corner office,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   or you got your free trip,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   or whatever it is you're gonna get.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   But it was all based on how much revenue
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   are you gonna extract from the client?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And then when I actually left that industry
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   and I started a money management company
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   where we charged AUM,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   and I charged a very low AUM.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   As you know, I was only charging
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   a quarter of a percent management fee,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and I wasn't doing financial planning,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   so it was truly just,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   "We will manage your portfolio and index funds
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   "and work with your financial planner,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   "but we're gonna charge you a low 0.25% fee."
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   But a lot of the advisors around me,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   in fact, most of the advisors around me,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   were, "You can never make it.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   "You have to charge one percent."
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   - Right, yep.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   - It was all about,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   "You deserve the right to get the most,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   "have a certain standard of living,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   "and you should charge what the market will bear."
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   - Exactly.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   - I was trying to charge what was fair,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   not what the market will bear.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   So it was all about,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   "How much money can you make from the clients?"
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   rather than, "What can you do for the clients?"
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Now that I'm doing the hourly thing,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I can see it even better,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   'cause even though I was charging a low fee
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   when I was managing money,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   now that I'm not doing that anymore,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I see the hourly fee or something like that
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   where it's more aligned
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   with actually helping the clients
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   rather than trying to get into their wallets
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   and get a piece of the action,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   is really the most fair way to do it.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   - Exactly.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   There are situations
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   where somebody does need to delegate
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   and have somebody babysitting
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   their financial lives for them,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   like a conservatorship
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   or possibly a widower,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   or someone with diminished capacity,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   or someone that's a busy professional
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   or busy living life in another way
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   or out of the country,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and they want to delegate it.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   If you've got that desire and the money to do it,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   by all means, there are providers to do that,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   and you will pay a lot for that service.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Unfortunately, for the middle market
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   and the do-it-yourselfers of the world,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   that's pretty much all there was,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and still to this day, almost all there is.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   But the tide is moving
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   away from definitely commissions,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   away from transaction costs.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   - And you're speaking about the fact
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   that ETF trading at Charles Schwab
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   and so forth is now all zero commission,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   and then the funds themselves
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   are a smidgen above zero.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   So, I mean, the actual costs
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   to manage a portfolio
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   literally have been driven down
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   to next to nothing,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   and the only last bastion of gluttony,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   if there is one out there,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   is the 1% AUM fee,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   which is the average fee
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   that a advisor charges
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   to manage, say, a $1 million portfolio.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   - And that's the average.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   - Well, that's true.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   It's unfortunate that's the average.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   - Unfortunately, there are higher ones,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   but yeah, that is an average.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   - So you had this philosophy,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and you were out on your own
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   doing hourly,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and nobody else was doing it.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I mean, how did it all come about
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   where you decided to create
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   a whole network of how many
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   hourly advisors?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   - Currently, 235.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   - You have this network of 235 advisors
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   that are following this philosophy,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and of course, this is not a new network now.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   It's almost 20 years old.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   So how did that come about?
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   - My financial planning practice
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   grew really fast,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   and I was having so much fun
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   and really feeling great
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   and having happy clients and happy me,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   and I told that story around the industry,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   and I started getting picked up
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   from some of the trade journals.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   What is this Yahoo doing?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Doing hourly financial planning
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and investment advice.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Well, when people read those kind of articles,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Bob Veres,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   a long-time journalist and industry
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   kind of visionary or futurist person
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   inside the financial services industry,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   tackled me about this
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and talked about my practice
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and then wrote a piece about what I'm doing
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   and compared it to kind of like a dentist's office
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   where you pay for services as you need them,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and you don't need a full-time financial planner
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   or a full-time dentist,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   but you do need to go to your dentist periodically,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   probably twice a year as they coach us,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   some people more often,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   some people less often,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   but we need to look at our financial advice that way.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I started getting as many inquiries
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   or calls and contacts from financial advisors,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   financial planners,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   wanting to do what I was doing,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   charging by the hour.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So I had lunch with a local person in Kansas City,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   and at lunch, he pulls out his checkbook and said,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   "What can I pay you to teach me
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   how to do what you're doing?"
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I'm just like, "This is crazy, insane."
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   At 15 months into my hourly practice,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   I spoke at an Institute of Certified Financial Planners
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   conference for new certified financial planners
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   or students of the program
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   about what we did all day long as a financial planner,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   and my message and who I worked with and how I worked
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   resonated with the audience extremely well,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   about 135 people in attendance,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   and when we broke instead of a panel discussion
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   with five people,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   we could go to one of five sections and spend the afternoon.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Almost the entire audience came to my section
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   because they could see themselves doing work
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   that mattered, that made a difference,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   and that wasn't all tied to implementing a product,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   selling a product, a transaction,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   or investment management.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   It was about financial planning.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So the interest of fellow financial advisors
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and then Bob Verri's doing an interview,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   he said, "Cheryl, you are obviously willing to share
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   what you have been doing,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and I know you're a capitalist,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   so why don't you bottle it and sell it?"
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   A year almost to that date,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   we had our first training class.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   We launched in February of 2000,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   so just shy of 20 years right now,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   and had our first training class in July of 2000
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   with 11 advisors.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So it just kind of continued to grow,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   about 50 new members a year,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   based on they had the shared philosophy
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   of doing the right thing for the client regardless.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You are asking these planners
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   to put aside the traditional sales culture
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   and money management culture that they grew up in
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   and to actually get down to the business
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   of doing financial planning and getting paid for it.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I really am very challenged to understand
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   as a financial planner,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   which as you know,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   we've discussed this numerous times,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   money management and financial planning
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   are distinctly different activities.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   - And they deserve a completely different fee model,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   no doubt.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I agree wholeheartedly.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   We don't attract financial advisors
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   to this way of working with clients
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   if they're in it for the,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   "How can I get rich off my clients' money
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   without working?"
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   That's a pretty significant funnel to go through
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   because you're self-selecting a philosophy
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   of how you're working
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and basing your charges on the time
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   that you invest working on behalf and with a client.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   - You started out with a class of 11.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Are any of the original 11 still in business?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   - Yes.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   One of them is on our member advisory board.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   - Okay.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   - And we have several from the next classes
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   in September of 2000 and October of 2000.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   We have members from all those classes still with us.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   - So you could put to rest the idea
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   that hourly advising as a profession
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   doesn't work for the advisor.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I think that after 20 years
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   of people being in the Garrett Planning Network,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   charging hourly, being successful at it,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   pretty much puts a nail in the coffin
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   that for the people who are the pundits who say,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   "No, you can't make it that way.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   You have to charge AUM.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   You have to charge higher fees."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   It's just simply not true.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   - Yeah.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   - So you've got now about 235 advisors
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   at the Garrett Planning Network.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   All of them have the same philosophy,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   but some of the bogleheads who I asked
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   on the forum, bogleheads.org,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   because I told them in the forum
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   that I was interviewing you
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   so they could write in questions,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   and they did.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   A couple of the questions,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I'd say three people were asking,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   "How do you screen the planners
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   who come into your network?"
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   - That's an excellent question.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And it's also a topic
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   that I've probably spent talking to journalists
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   over the last two or four years,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   most of anything,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   is how do you find a financial planner
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   that's right for you?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And what do you need to look at
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   and that kind of thing?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I'll tell you what we do
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   at the Garrett Planning Network.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   No level of screening can be exhaustive,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   but I want everyone to be really crystal clear
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   on what we do do,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and then also what I would encourage individuals to do
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   when they want to take it to the next step.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   So what we do at the Garrett Planning Network
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   is we receive an application.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   We also require their ADV documents,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   the annual filing for registered investment advisors.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   There is a zero testing or requirement
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   to call yourself a financial planner in this country.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   - That's a really good point.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I mean, there are regulations or laws that say
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   if you're going to call yourself
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   a registered investment advisor,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   you, in fact, have to be registered
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   with either states,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   or you have to be registered with the federal government
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   through the Security and Exchange Commission.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   - Or if you call yourself an investment advisor,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   you better do it.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   - Right.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I know I live in Texas here,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   and if you say you give one iota of investment advice
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   for any kind of compensation at all,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   you have to register.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   No discussion about it.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   But financial planner, different.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   - Yeah.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Anybody can call themselves a financial planner.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   I guess it's as easy as guru and such.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   You know, you see the commercials
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   about guru, teacher, coach, whatever.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Financial planner is the type of work that we do,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   might be the job title, but there's no curriculum.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Other than we embrace or recognize
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   two primary designations,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   and one being the CFP, Certified Financial Planner,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   and the second being the designation
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   that a CPA would have,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   if they've also had a financial planning training
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   equivalent to the CFP,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   which is Personal Financial Specialist.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   So they'd be a CPA/PFS.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Other exclusions above and beyond the CFP designation
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   would be like a person who has a PhD in financial planning.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I think I would say they would qualify.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   A person who has a master's,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and we have had these folks as members.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   They're teaching educational programs,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   the financial planning program around the country.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   So that is our educational criteria.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And then we want to look at their application
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   and tell me why.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   I want to hear a lot of their philosophical approaches
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   and how they expect to build their businesses
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   and are they prepared for a certain amount of time
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   to get their businesses up and running,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   because I don't want people to join our group
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   and not be successful.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So they need to be prepared for what it takes
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   to start a practice and get it to a point
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   where it can sustain itself,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   and they can focus on taking care of their clients.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   So one of the Bogleheads has asked a really good question
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   about how often you need to do a financial plan.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And his comment is,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   "Do investors modify financial plans more or less frequently
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   "when using assets under management
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   "as a form of compensation to their advisor
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   "or some sort of a fee-based model like hourly?"
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I have zero statistics on that question,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   and it's quite interesting, but I'll give you my guess.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   I would tend to think that if people are acting as a fiduciary,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   there shouldn't be much difference.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Now, what happens in between visits to an episodic advisor,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   such as the services I provided on an hourly basis,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   is if I don't know about it, I don't know about it,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   versus the AUM advisor who better know about it
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   because they're getting paid to watch.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Let me talk about that for a second
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   because "We'll watch it for you" was always something
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   that the brokerage industry was...
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   It's a great sales line.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Don't worry, we'll watch it for you.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   But in fact, look, I was an AUM advisor for 20 years.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   All I'm watching is the revenue come in from your portfolio.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   You know, when are you adding money, when are you not adding?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Or the portfolio react to the market.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Right, that's what I'm watching.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   In other words, to talk with you on a regular basis...
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   It's a good sales line, though.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Yeah, yeah, "I'll watch it for you" is a big deal.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   It provides a lot of comfort to people.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   If you do a really good financial plan for somebody,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   how often do you have to redo it?
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Well, it depends on age and circumstance.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Really, circumstance.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   If I were working with young people,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   we're making projections about stuff
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   that's going to happen decades from now.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   We can't even come close.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I mean, what we're going is from...
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Imagine my arms are straight out to my sides, 180 degrees.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And we take a look at the current trajectory you're on
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and plot that out.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Precision projected over time is not precision.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   And it's an illusion of precision and it's insanity.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   But having targets and knowing that you're heading
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   in the right direction is really helpful.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   For young people, if you put a plan together and say,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   "By this time next year, I should have X amount
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   in my net worth.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I'm going to pay down debt by this and build up assets
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   or cash reserves or whatever.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Those are my goals."
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And if you meet those goals and nothing else really changes
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   in your life, you don't even update.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But sometimes things happen, like regulations change.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   When the Roth IRA became available,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   if a 529 plan might make sense,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   some of these boglehead folks would likely be aware of them.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   But the average client that I worked with wasn't necessarily
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   a dyed-in-the-wool reader of all things personal finance
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and fiduciary.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Great kind of advice.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Cheryl, when you're paying an AUM fee for not only
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   portfolio management but financial planning,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   you do the financial plan the first year.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   How much extra work is it year 2, year 3, year 4, year 5?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Do you think that advisors who charge for financial planning
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   and asset management, say using 1%, are maybe overcharging
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   for the financial planning side?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Probably not in year 1, but, you know, I don't know what the--
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I need dollars rather than percentages.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Okay, so let's talk about somebody who has $1 million.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   I have $1 million, and I'm going to--
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   $10,000, yeah, you're probably overpaying,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   unless you got a--
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   But that's the average fee.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I mean, that's the average fee for an advisor.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   If you look at the statistics, it's $1 million.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   They charge 1%.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   They get $10,000 a year.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And then when you question them about it, they say, well--
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Just because it's average doesn't make it right.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Well, but they say, when I argue with them on Twitter,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   they say, well, we add a lot of value.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   We are--our clients rely on us, and, you know, we are--
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We are a coach to them, and we are a--
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   I don't disagree.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   --circuit breaker to them when the markets go down,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   because they're--we're a behavioral coach,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and we're going to keep them in the market
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   when they want to get out.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Now, I don't believe a lot of that, by the way,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   because, again, when I was managing money,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   people didn't just, when the market went down,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   all of a sudden panic and sell.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I mean, there might have been a few that did that,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   but very, very few of the clients do that.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So, you know, the question is, to you,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   is how often, you know, do you need to redo
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   the whole financial plan where you're paying
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   1% per year fee for asset management,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   which you can get very low cost these days,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and then the rest of it is all of these other services
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   that have really nothing to do with managing the money,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   but it does have to do with personal finance.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   But you're paying an awful lot of money for that,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and I can see this, the year one,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   where you're doing the big financial plan,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   but how often do you need to do a big financial plan?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Probably only once,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   and perhaps if we've done a plan together,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   updating it is easy.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Yeah, it doesn't take nearly as much time.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Oh, no, no.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Subsequent years, just maintaining,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   you know, if you're in good stead,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   if we get you all lined up and maintaining that,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   that's when the formulas melt down,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   because they don't go down
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   with the amount of time expended.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Right, exactly.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   So this is what I might point about,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   let's say, assets under management.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   So you have a financial planner/money manager
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   who is going to manage your portfolio
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   and do a big financial plan for you,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   and the first year, if they charge some fee,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   let's call it 1%,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   okay, you know, $10,000 on $1 million,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   but the second year,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   why wouldn't the fee drop to .5%?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Because they're not spending nearly as much time.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Right, good question,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   and that's one that I would want answered
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   before I would even consider working with that advisor.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I also would do another thing,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   is you mentioned this scenario as a financial planner
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   who also provides money management services
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   and charges this as one consolidated fee.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   That is most common.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Also, I don't like it.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I do allow AUM charging by Garrett members,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   but hourly has to be primary,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   and it has to be provided for the accessibility,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   and our members are well informed
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   that I personally do not like AUM for financial planners.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   For money managers, if the price is fair,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I don't have an issue with it
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   because managing a portfolio like you used to do
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   at 25 basis points
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   can be a really appropriate service for certain clients,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and I say for certain clients
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   because I don't think everybody needs their portfolio managed.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   They might be able to buy a handful of funds
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and have it checked up on annually
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   or something along those lines
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   and just pay for the time for that checkup.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Am I still in the right place?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Is there any reason I should change?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And those kind of questions is what I'd like to see.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   So what I would love to see in financial planning
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   is separate out the fee for financial planning.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Absolutely. 100% agree with that.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Yeah, so if people are looking for a financial planner
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and they also offer investment management services,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   have them break it out.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   If they say, "We don't," just leave.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Well, let's talk a bit about your network
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   and that you just said
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   that you do allow assets under management.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   You do allow your planners to charge,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   and if there's one criticism I have heard
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   of the Garrett Planning Network,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   and it's a fair criticism
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   because I experienced it myself
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   when I'm trying to find financial planners
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   because I'm not a financial planner.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I just do the investing.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   So when I'm trying to find
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   a hourly financial planner for somebody,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   I go to the Garrett Planning Network website.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   I look up who the advisors are
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   in a particular area where a client is.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   The first thing I look at is are they managing money?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   And if the answer is yes, they manage money,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I wouldn't typically send them to that planner.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   I would try to find a planner who does not manage money.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   And the reason for this is because--
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   and this is what I've heard, and I know it's true--
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   that a lot of the bogleheads
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   who have contacted Garrett planners
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   were a little bit disenchanted by what happened.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   They go there to talk with them about financial planning,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   and then they get pitched money management.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And it is a criticism I hear quite often
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   from the bogleheads.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   How would you answer that criticism?
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   - Let me know. [laughs]
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I don't want it either.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And we have removed a couple of advisors for that.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Now, I want to clarify.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   We have removed a couple advisors
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   for pitching AUM services
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   and the client specifically needed, in my opinion,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   and the client's opinion and desires.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   They wanted to pay on an hourly basis for their time
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   and not based on their assets,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and that should have been made available as an option,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   and it wasn't, and that individual is no longer with us.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   And so, you know, we've had two types of complaints
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   in our 20 years.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Luckily, they haven't been all that often.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   And yes, I very much am aware that the bogleheads community--
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   you know, it's kind of like
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   the fee-only financial planners community.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   We're really tight.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   We talk to each other.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I know you all do, too.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Most, if not all, of our members
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   would be very familiar with bogleheads--
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   the love of low-cost indexing, being frugal,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   that kind of thing.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   You just go in and say,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   "I listened to a podcast with Cheryl Garrett on it,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   and she said you all offer hourly,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   and if you don't get what you're looking for,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   feel free to contact me."
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Another question.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So, Cheryl, you have had planners
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   come into your organization,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   and then there have been some who have left the organization,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   as you mentioned a minute ago.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   What is your retention rate for planners every year?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Yeah, I wish it was 99%,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   but it's right at 89% to 90%.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   And the ones who leave, why--
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   besides the fact that they get out of the business
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   or pass away or retire,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   I mean, are they just not making it as hourly planners?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Well, yes, and there could be reasons why.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   One of them that I run into
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   is some people are not designed to be entrepreneurs.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Being the person who is in charge of everything
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   and you're alone,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   and that's one of the reasons for our network
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   is we are all self-employed,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and it does get quite lonely out there,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   and the subject matter that we deal with is so broad.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   It's really amazingly powerful
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   to be able to tap into a network of peers,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   and so that's the reason we exist
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   is to help leverage our time, talents, and energies
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   to better serve our clients and keep our sanity.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Cheryl, the hourly model,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   is it better suited toward younger people?
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Is it better suited towards people who are in midlife?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Or is it better suited towards people who are nearing retirement?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   I mean, who would you say it's best suited for?
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Or maybe it's not suited for anybody better than anybody else.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   That's an interesting question.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   As I can see,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   very rewarding outcomes for all of those groups.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Best suited for a validator
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   and the do-it-yourselfers of the world,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   the people that we can't serve best is the delegator.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Could you explain what a delegator is
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   rather than a do-it-yourselfer?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Someone who comes in and shares,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   "Here's what I want to do, and here's what I've got going on.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   "You deal with it. I'll pay you."
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And they leave and dump it all on you.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   An hourly advisor is not a good fit for that.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Yeah, I could see that.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   I mean, I see it in my own practice
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   where I can help people to a point,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   but if they want somebody to implement
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   and someone to oversee on an ongoing basis, it's not me.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Right, precisely.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   That sums it up.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   When the client can do the implementation,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I found that that is often about half of a financial plan's cost,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   the legwork to implement.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And we, as financial advisors, can't implement everything anyway,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   so the client's doing a good amount of it themselves.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   So why not empower them to fix it for themselves?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I completely agree with that.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   This brings me into the final question
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   that we had by the Bogleheads, and here it is.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   "Why should a Boglehead investor with a three-fund portfolio
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   "consider consulting with a fee-only financial planner?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   "I don't need investment advice."
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Now, let me explain what a three-fund portfolio is.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   You probably already know, but I'll explain it again.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   It's just simply investing in three broad index funds--
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   a total U.S. stock market index fund,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   a total international stock index fund,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   and then a bond index fund of some sort.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   But it's just three simple funds, a very simple portfolio.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   So somebody who follows that strategy
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   and doesn't really need any investment advice,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   why use a financial advisor?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Definitely may not need an investment advisor.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   The financial planning is a much broader field.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Investment advice is one aspect.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Frequently, questions regarding,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   "When should I start Social Security?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   "Which employee benefits do I need?
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   "How much should I be saving for this?
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   "Should I take 0% financing
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   "or the $2,000 cash back on buying the car?"
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Some of these questions may be, like, automatic
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   to the listeners of the podcast.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   They are personally educated.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   But every once in a while, we run into stuff
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   that we need to ask a professional
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   or somebody for a second opinion.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   A lot of the clients I worked with,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   they viewed me as more of a second opinion.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   They called me their advisor.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   But, you know, a number of them were quite savvy investors.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   But they wanted a holistic overview,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   kind of look at the whole thing.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And finally, I can't let you go without talking about this.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   You're a famous person because President Obama himself
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   called you out, I guess that's the word,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   while you were in an audience
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and was telling the world, basically,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   what a fantastic job that you were doing,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   trying to push the idea
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   that a financial advisor should be a fiduciary.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Tell me about that whole experience.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   It's still surreal.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   It's the first time, to my knowledge,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   any president has recognized a financial advisor
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   and financial planner particularly,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   and I'm very, very proud of that.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   What happened?
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   I had been participating in the fiduciary advocacy work
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   in Washington with a number of other volunteers.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   And as I kept repeating horror stories
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   that I had witnessed as an expert witness
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   or litigation consultant over the last few years,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   these stories resonated and they're about normal people,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   you know, average Americans getting ripped off
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   by the current system.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And I got a call about a week before that
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   mentioned by the president from a person
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   with the White House, and I didn't really think about it.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   I was kind of thinking, well, you know,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   I'm paying attention, actually.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Nor did I think, you know, anything I said
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   would actually go anywhere other than to help the rule,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   the fiduciary rule.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   I was going to listen to the president's upcoming speeches
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   because they interviewed me for the potential of,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   it was the speech writer, and she was potentially going
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   to put some of my comments or thoughts
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   into the president's speech.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   So that's how it came about.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I got a call just before the speech was to occur,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   the Friday before that Monday speech,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   asking me if I could be in attendance.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   And I got to Washington, D.C., and sat in the audience
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   and listened to the various presentations
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   or announcements, and then in comes President Obama,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   and he lends his support to the DOL fiduciary rule,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   and then he starts talking about gunslingers
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   in the Wild Wild West have no regulations
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   over certain parts of their activities.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, those are my words, or maybe.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   And then he said my name, and I don't remember anything.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   I got home the next day.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Seriously, I got home the next day and watched it on YouTube,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   and I had, of course, hordes of emails from people.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Of course.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   How many times did he say your name?
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Eight.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   I never, never in my wildest imagination
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   would have expected to be quoted.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   I mean, that's--it still, in my mind, did not happen.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   But I'm really proud of the person it did happen to.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Well, it did happen, and it couldn't have happened
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   to a more wonderful person who has done so much
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   for the average person out there with their finances and start--
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   We're not average.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   We're stupendous.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Okay, we're stupendous.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   We're normal.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   We're normal.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Everybody's above average.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   That's right.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Well, I'm so glad you came on the show today, Cheryl,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   and told us your story and told us a lot of good stories,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   I should say.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And I think that--I wish the Garrett Network continued success.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   I think that--I think alternative models are the--
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   alternative ways in which you pay an advisor
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   are finally in the forefront out there and are getting more publicity.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And, of course, you've been one of the big advocates for 20 years,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   and I wish you continued luck.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   And thank you so much for being on the show.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Oh, thank you, and my sincere pleasure.
