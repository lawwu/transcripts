[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.720]   given to studies of mental health, physical health,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.940]   and human performance.

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.500]   is for you.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.620]   And now without further ado, I will answer your questions.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.420]   And as always, I will strive to be as thorough as possible,
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.340]   as clear as possible, and as concise as possible.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.540]   Our first question is about abstaining from thoughts.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.860]   And in answering this question,
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.660]   we're going to skirt right up against a topic
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.380]   that I've covered before on the podcast,
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.700]   which is obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.200]   which is a very serious disorder.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.780]   I mean, it can have a range of severity,
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.740]   but people with true OCD suffer a lot from obsessions.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.060]   These are intrusive thoughts and compulsions,
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.860]   which are the behaviors typically associated
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.060]   with those thoughts.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.540]   I think it's really important that we define OCD
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.180]   really clearly so that we can make sure
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.980]   that we're talking about intrusive thoughts
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.900]   and the desire to abstain from thoughts versus OCD
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.920]   and where there might be some overlap there.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580]   The functional definition of OCD
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.360]   that really pertains to the disorder,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.340]   obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD,
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.860]   as opposed to, you know, we call people neurotic,
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.100]   or we say, you have OCD,
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.540]   or I'm so OCD about this or OCD about that,
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.740]   that's become kind of common use of the acronym OCD.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.540]   But true OCD is a situation
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.540]   in which the engaging in a particular compulsive behavior
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.580]   does not serve to reduce the intensity
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.280]   or the frequency of the obsessions.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.940]   In fact, it makes it worse, okay?
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.060]   So the typical thing that we hear these days is,
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.420]   oh, you're so OCD, or he's so OCD,
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.380]   or she's so OCD, or I'm so OCD.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.580]   Now, if someone is OCD in that sense, okay,
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.180]   so not the clinical disorder,
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.220]   but OCD in the sense that, you know, they're really clean,
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.080]   they're really fastidious,
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.780]   they need everything perfect.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.380]   However, that person can achieve some level of calm
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.500]   and comfort that's fairly long lasting
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.080]   if everything's clean and perfect.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.220]   Well, then that's not obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.100]   This is really important to understand
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.680]   as we venture into answering the question
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.340]   about intrusive thoughts
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.940]   and the desire to abstain from certain thoughts.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.900]   A person with true OCD will keep cleaning and cleaning
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.980]   or washing their hands
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.140]   or arranging things at perfect right angles,
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.700]   but the more they do it, the more their anxiety goes up.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.500]   A person who has more typical,
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.280]   gosh, we don't really even have a language
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.820]   for this nowadays, unfortunately,
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.540]   but the sort of person that's extremely particular,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.060]   they need things a certain way,
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.960]   and they're very driven to resolve things and do things
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.000]   to make sure that things are done in a certain way
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.080]   or handled in a certain way.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.360]   Well, if that person can experience relief
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.760]   from engaging in, let's say, exercise or from cleaning,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.840]   right, you'd say you're so OCD about exercise.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.280]   Well, but if exercising for an hour
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.540]   or even two hours in the morning
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.440]   makes somebody really calm in the rest of the day
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.800]   and they don't need to exercise,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.260]   well, then they're not necessarily true OCD.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.880]   They don't necessarily have a disorder related to exercise.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.600]   However, if they're exercising for two hours in the morning
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.120]   and then they find they can't concentrate on other things
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.820]   and their desire to exercise just increases and increases
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.780]   and becomes intrusive for them,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.200]   disrupting their quality of life throughout the day,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.820]   well, then that's falling under the umbrella
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.760]   of what we would call a true disorder, okay?
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.440]   So we want to highlight that
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.120]   because the question is about a desire
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.200]   to abstain from thoughts,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.160]   and the question is in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lemke,
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.640]   and I should just mention Dr. Anna Lemke
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.280]   is the director of our dual diagnosis addiction clinic
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.800]   She's the author of this incredible book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.620]   that I think everybody should read.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.440]   I do believe everyone should read that book.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.040]   So important for the addict and non-addict alike
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.800]   because it deals with basically the state of our life.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.060]   Nowadays, we're living in this dopamine-rich world
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.460]   where we can quickly become dopamine depleted,
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.680]   which is terrible, leads to depression.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.300]   In addition to things like addiction in some folks, et cetera,
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.680]   Anna was a guest on the podcast.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.240]   You can find her episode at hubermanlab.com.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.520]   Just put Anna.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.400]   I think she's the only guest we've had thus far
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.080]   whose name is Anna, so it'll just pop up there.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.680]   The entire website is searchable,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.820]   but if you want to listen to that episode
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.760]   or watch that episode, you can access it, hubermanlab.com.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.240]   The question is, in your discussion with Dr. Analemke,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.020]   you were talking about abstaining from people's drug
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.080]   of choice for 30 days to reset the dopamine reward pathway.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.640]   And indeed, that is the prescriptive
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.020]   that Dr. Analemke gives for most all addictions
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.240]   and for people that are suffering
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.900]   from mild or even severe depression
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.920]   related to dopamine-seeking behaviors,
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.440]   social media, video games, sex, food, et cetera.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.320]   However, of course, in the instance of food
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.280]   or in some other addictions, you can't abstain for 30 days.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.200]   That would be terrible to abstain for food for 30 days.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.360]   I'm sure people have done it, but it is not healthy to do.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.040]   Certain things like alcohol and drugs,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.560]   people can abstain for 30 days
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.240]   in efforts to never go back to them again.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.720]   There are cases of severe alcohol or opiate dependence
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.960]   where people can't go cold turkey or they risk dying,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.120]   so there they need to really work with a physician.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.100]   But the 30-day reset of the dopamine system
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.340]   is something that's very real
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.240]   and that pertains to most people.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.720]   That is, it's going to be very effective
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.400]   for most people struggling with either behavioral,
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.120]   what are sometimes called process addictions
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.360]   or other types of addictions,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.240]   including substance abuse issues.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.120]   The question continues,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.580]   "You said you were going to ask Ana how to abstain
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.080]   if your drug of choice is a thought or narrative
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.240]   as opposed to a substance or a behavior."
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.800]   The question continues, "As far as I can tell,
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.160]   your discussion with Ana moved on
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.360]   before you asked her the question.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.100]   Would you be able to discuss strategies
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.020]   for abstaining from addictive thoughts and narratives?"
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.580]   Okay, so let's talk about intrusive thoughts
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.300]   and let's start off by asking ourselves,
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.420]   what is a thought?
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.440]   Okay, in the realm of neurobiology, we have sensations,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.240]   which are the processes by which our neurons, nerve cells,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.060]   convert light photons, sound waves,
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.380]   touch, mechanical pressure, et cetera,
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.900]   into electrical signals and chemical signals
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.300]   that head into our nervous system,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.560]   including our brain, and then our brain,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   at least we think, makes sense of them
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.240]   and help us navigate the world that we're in.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.960]   Okay, so the sensation part is a pure transformation
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.100]   of mechanical information or, in some cases,
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.600]   chemical information, like smell.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.040]   Chemicals, literally, volatile chemicals
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.380]   floating around in the world are brought into your nose
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.720]   and your neurons in your olfactory bulb,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.760]   convert those into electrical and chemical signals
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   that your brain can understand.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.380]   Perceptions are your idea
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.400]   of what those signals out in the world are,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.160]   either because you're paying attention to them
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.200]   or for some other reason,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   you decide that a stop sign in front of you is red
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.140]   and that the sign behind it is white
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.680]   and that the sky is blue or cloudy, those are perceptions.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.220]   Okay, so we have sensations and perceptions.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.620]   Then we have emotions,
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.700]   which are these things that include the mind and body
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.600]   that are related to neuromodulators
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.200]   like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.380]   although those chemicals do other things as well.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.240]   And then, of course, we have behaviors, actions,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.400]   everything from me moving my pen on a piece of paper
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.360]   to walking, running, et cetera.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:59.100]   Thoughts are a fifth category of neural functioning
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.720]   that we really need to define,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.600]   but that doesn't have as strict a definition
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.020]   as sensations, perceptions, or feeling, or action.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.320]   But thoughts are real, right?
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.820]   We all know this, thoughts are real.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.100]   And one way that we can define thoughts
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.120]   is that thoughts are perceptions
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   that include data from the past, present, or future, okay?
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.220]   Or combinations of past and present,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.480]   or present and future, or future and past, okay?
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.880]   I'm not trying to give an overly complicated definition here,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.580]   but if we are going to answer a question
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.200]   about how to abstain from thoughts
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.540]   in a really direct and actionable way,
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.860]   we really need to address what are thoughts.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.080]   So thoughts are perceptions that are generated internally,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.620]   right, we don't need any external sensation
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.480]   in order to have a thought, we can close our eyes,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.180]   we could be in sensory isolation for that matter,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.000]   we can even be floating with no gravity,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.360]   and we can have a thought.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.440]   Thoughts tend to run pretty much automatically
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.660]   in the background all the time,
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.420]   some people refer to this as chatter
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.720]   in the back of our minds, in a very unstructured way.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.880]   And then if we force our thoughts to be structured,
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.440]   because we decide they need to be,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.440]   or if something in our environment captures our perception,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.540]   then our thoughts tend to be structured.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.740]   Let me give you an example.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.860]   If I'm just walking around,
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.900]   if there were a way in which we could broadcast my thoughts
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.600]   onto a screen, I hope we wouldn't do that,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.280]   but those thoughts would be a mixture
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.440]   of semi-complete sentences and gibberish.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.580]   However, if somebody stops me and says,
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.560]   "Hi, good to see you, what are you doing today?"
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.180]   And I start answering, well, then my thoughts
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.180]   are suddenly being driven by an external stimulus,
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.080]   their question, and some internal ideas,
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.720]   memory of who I am and what I'm doing that day,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.240]   so past and present and so on,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.200]   and so thoughts become structured.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.780]   So when we have a question about how to abstain from thoughts
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.320]   we need to be additionally specific and really pinpoint
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.160]   that what we're trying to do is to abstain
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.400]   from thoughts we don't want, presumably,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.760]   either because they are too repetitive and distracting,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.080]   or because what's contained in those thoughts is disturbing.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.960]   Okay, this is important because it gives us two answers
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.200]   to the questions that are highly divergent.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.720]   One answer to the question of how to abstain
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.840]   from intrusive thoughts, thoughts that we're addicted to,
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.780]   is if those thoughts are merely on loop all the time
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.600]   and we can't stop them,
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.960]   but the thoughts themselves aren't particularly disturbing,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.880]   so think about a song you can't get out of your head,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.160]   or you keep recounting some event,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.200]   but the event itself isn't very disturbing,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.760]   it's just intrusive because it's there.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.400]   Well, in that case, the data really point
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.040]   to trying to anchor your thoughts to some external stimulus,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.180]   so getting into action, getting into activities
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.120]   that really draw your attention away from that thought.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.320]   Now, you may still hear it scrolling in the background,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.980]   so you might be sitting in class still hearing
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.280]   that loop of thoughts in the background.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.540]   That's something that over time ought to wane,
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.520]   it ought to disappear,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.700]   if we try and bring more and more attention
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.740]   to whatever it is that's in our environment,
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.840]   whatever it is that we happen to be learning
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.800]   or doing physically, et cetera.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.180]   Things like mindful meditation,
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.560]   doing a 10 or even just five minutes a day practice
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.960]   of sitting with eyes closed or lying down with eyes closed
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.900]   and really focusing on one's breath,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.000]   focusing one's attention on the,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.580]   sometimes it's called the third eye center,
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.140]   but in science, we'd say just the region
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.980]   right behind the forehead,
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.340]   you're directing your attention there,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.480]   has been shown to increase focus for singular topics
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.600]   and can improve memory
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.740]   and do a bunch of other things as well.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.820]   Those are data from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.080]   at New York University.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.720]   She was a guest on the podcast as well.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.240]   My laboratory has run studies on mindful meditation as well.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.300]   So what you're really trying to do
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.360]   is learn how to focus better on one thing
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.320]   and by focusing on that one thing,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.860]   you focus off these repetitive thoughts.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.360]   Now, I have a feeling that this question was asked
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.180]   and that many people upvoted this question
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.200]   because the issue isn't just thoughts that are intrusive
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.820]   because they're there and on repeat,
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.820]   but because the thoughts themselves are actually troubling.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.080]   This could be recounting a trauma,
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.140]   someone harmed you, you observed something
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.120]   that was disturbing, you felt wronged,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.580]   you felt someone else was wronged,
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.780]   you can't seem to get your mind off of something
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.660]   and your emotions tend to follow and so it's uncomfortable.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.160]   I have a feeling this is the root of the question.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.020]   In that case, the approach is very different.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.660]   What we know from essentially all of the quality scientific
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.820]   and clinical studies is that those sorts
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.540]   of intrusive thoughts are very much like a trauma.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.600]   Now, we have to be clear in defining what trauma is.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.700]   I'll use the definition that Dr. Paul Conte,
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.420]   another incredible guest that was on our podcast,
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.060]   a psychiatrist, Stanford Harvard trained psychiatrist,
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.140]   I think one of the world's foremost leaders
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.300]   on the issue of trauma and psychiatry
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.600]   and psychology generally.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.180]   He defines trauma as an event or something
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.860]   that fundamentally changes the way
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.300]   that your nervous system works
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   such that you function less adaptively going forward
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.540]   from that event, okay?
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.560]   So not every bad occurrence in your life is a trauma.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.040]   That's good news.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.360]   The bad news is many people have traumas
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.740]   and traumas change the way that our nervous system works
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.580]   so that we don't function as well as we could.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.140]   So in that sense, intrusive thoughts that are disturbing
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.860]   are in many ways traumas and are reinforcing that trauma.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.340]   Now, we know that almost counter-intuitively
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.100]   in order to deal with trauma,
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.380]   you have to get very close to that trauma.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.560]   You don't have to re-expose
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.480]   and I would hope you would not re-expose yourself
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.500]   to the very same trauma.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.220]   But we know that one of the best ways to deal with traumas
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.560]   is to get very clear about the narrative
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.620]   around those traumas.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.660]   Now, this can be done with a therapist, ideally,
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.540]   but not everyone has access to therapy
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.700]   or can afford therapy.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.220]   There's a range of quality of therapists for that matter.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.080]   So we're always referring to
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.400]   the desire for people to do great therapy
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.540]   with really great, meaning, excellently trained people.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.940]   But it turns out that if you want to
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.180]   extinguish an intrusive thought,
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.040]   one of the best ways to do that
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.720]   is to journal about that particular thought extensively.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.960]   So rather than the earlier strategy for intrusive thoughts
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.280]   where they're just on loop and intrusive
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.340]   because they're on loop and present,
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.940]   but their content isn't disturbing,
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.280]   when a thought is disturbing and intrusive,
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.340]   we know that it's very useful to script out as much detail
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.740]   about that particular thought
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.060]   and the things around it as possible.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.540]   Obviously, you want to do this in a way
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.380]   that is fairly structured.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.380]   So you ideally would use complete sentences.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.860]   So the reason for doing that is that
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.520]   thoughts, as I mentioned earlier, can often be fragmentary.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.140]   So they pop up in our mind almost,
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.700]   we seemingly spontaneously,
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.300]   they're inhibiting our ability to focus
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.820]   or be present to work or family or other things or sleep.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.860]   Writing things down in a lot of detail
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.060]   does seem to have this quality of
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.180]   both reducing the emotional load
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.380]   of whatever it is that that thought is about,
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.780]   as well as diminishing the frequency
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.060]   of those intrusive thoughts over time.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.100]   So this is far and away different
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.280]   than the strategy I mentioned
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.900]   for the other types of intrusive thoughts.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.100]   And really it's far and away different
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.300]   from the 30-day abstinence approach
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.080]   that Dr. Analemki was talking about
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.380]   for substance or behavioral addictions.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.720]   Now, of course, this process of abstaining from thoughts
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.800]   or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.740]   can definitely take some time.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.460]   So a good example there would be superstitions.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.660]   You know, I'll come clean here,
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.180]   and I've talked about this before on a few podcasts,
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.380]   that when I was in college,
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.820]   I developed a sort of a knock on wood superstition.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.060]   Anytime I'd say something that I didn't want to happen
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.980]   or did want to happen,
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.540]   I'd say knock on wood, and I'd knock on wood.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.740]   And then I started suppressing the behavior,
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.260]   mostly because it was a little embarrassing.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.820]   And then I started just telling myself in my head,
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.980]   knock on wood, knock on wood, knock on wood.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.580]   And it was clearly a little bit of an OCD type thing.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.160]   But again, OCD in air quotes here,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.220]   I think it qualified as OCD in the sense that
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.660]   the more I did it, the more I wanted to do it.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.820]   So I needed to go cold turkey on the thinking,
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.780]   but how can you go cold turkey on a thought?
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.620]   You couldn't.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.280]   What I was told to do and what worked very well for me
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.940]   was to just write down the worst possible outcome
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.240]   that I was concerned about.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.820]   So to really get close to the nature
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.320]   or the underlying basis of that intrusive thought.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   And I raised this because a lot of times
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.260]   the intrusive thought is not,
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.020]   okay, I'm thinking about a car accident,
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.500]   or I'm thinking about a breakup,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.800]   or I'm thinking about an exam that I have.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.100]   That can be intrusive,
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.780]   but a lot of times it's some kind of nebulous,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.740]   abstract set of words or ideas or images
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.220]   around something that happened
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.820]   that we saw or heard or experienced.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.600]   And by putting a lot of clear structure
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.980]   to what the thought is exactly,
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.100]   and to putting some thought and structure onto paper
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:24.100]   about what that pattern of not healthy thinking relates to,
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.260]   people often achieve tremendous relief
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.560]   in a fairly short amount of time.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.400]   Sometimes just in one session of writing it down,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.620]   sometimes they need to write it down multiple times.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.940]   What you're essentially trying to do
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.020]   with a intrusive thought or a trauma of any kind
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.300]   is you're trying to turn a disturbing story,
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.220]   that is a story that evokes a lot of emotion
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.920]   and captures, it kind of hijacks your nervous system,
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.020]   into what is essentially a known but repetitive
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.380]   and kind of old boring story
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.940]   where the emotional load has been depleted.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.040]   And there, of course, I have to highlight the fact
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.800]   that getting sufficient rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.060]   we also know is very important
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.400]   for removing the emotional load of traumatic experiences
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.420]   and intrusive thoughts.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.380]   So you really want to strive
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.100]   to get the best possible sleep you can
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.140]   that includes sufficient rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.620]   And we have multiple zero cost resources
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.940]   for that at HubermanLab.com.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.220]   We have the episode on Master Your Sleep.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.860]   We have the episode on Perfect Your Sleep.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.320]   We have the toolkit for sleep,
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.360]   all of which are timestamped
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.900]   and all of which can be accessed to completely zero cost
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.700]   to try and get your sleep as good as possible,
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.940]   including lots of rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.300]   So in order to remove intrusive and addictive thoughts,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.420]   ask yourself, is this OCD of the classic sense?
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.380]   If it is, you should see a psychiatrist.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.100]   They won't necessarily prescribe medication,
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.300]   but there are tools for true OCD
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.040]   that are very effective in many cases.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.420]   And we did the episode on OCD,
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.480]   which I invite you to listen to as well.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.360]   You want to ask yourself, are the thoughts disturbing
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.660]   or merely intrusive and repetitive?
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.020]   If they're merely intrusive and repetitive,
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.680]   well then learning to focus your attention on other things
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.040]   and getting better at focusing on single things
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.860]   through an exercise like mindfulness meditation
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.700]   can really help.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.860]   And indeed, perhaps the best use of mindfulness meditation
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.520]   is to improve your level of focus.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.000]   It does have other benefits as well,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.400]   but that's going to be the major one
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.240]   that one will experience,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.020]   even with these very short five or 10 minute a day
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.580]   meditations, great data on that
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.920]   from the scientific literature.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.200]   And then if those intrusive thoughts
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.920]   are not only intrusive, but they're also disturbing,
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.660]   in that case, you really want to put as much structure
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.340]   and thought, believe it or not,
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.180]   into what those thoughts are really about,
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.860]   write them out on paper in complete sentences,
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.340]   and maybe do that multiple times
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.200]   until the underlying emotions
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.580]   related to those thoughts really start to diminish.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.580]   And by doing that,
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.200]   you're essentially doing your own form of trauma therapy,
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.900]   for lack of a better way to put it.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.900]   And again, the data really point to the fact
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.420]   that getting close to the specific details
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.660]   around those intrusive thoughts
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.580]   is going to be the best way to extinguish them.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.140]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.080]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.460]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.060]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.340]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.540]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.140]   standard channel and premium tools
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.560]   not released anywhere else,
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.700]   please go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.900]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.100]   the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.980]   it's really twofold.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.900]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.380]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.640]   which of course will still be continued
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.100]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.500]   We are not going to change the format
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.080]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.540]   and to fund research.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.600]   In particular, research done on human beings,
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.660]   so not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.460]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.660]   that we are most interested in.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.660]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.300]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.240]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.640]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.340]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.660]   and other media channels.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.220]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.420]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.620]   and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.340]   that provides those kinds of answers in the first place.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.700]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.660]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.020]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.940]   raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.540]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.500]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.560]   to further support research for science
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.340]   and science related tools for mental health,
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.860]   physical health, and performance.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.700]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.460]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.500]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.260]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.620]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.500]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.080]   And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.460]   that other people ask as well.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.400]   There will also be some premium content
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.200]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.120]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.340]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes and not found elsewhere.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.660]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.020]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.420]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.100]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.980]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.840]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.000]   (upbeat music)
