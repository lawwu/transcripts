[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.160]   Today I'd like to invite you to join me for a brief thought experiment and
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.300]   metaphor. Here's the question. If I ask you to make a list of all the
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.320]   different types of hammers that you can think of, how many hammers can you put on
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.400]   that list? You're welcome if you're driving to take a moment and hit pause
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.580]   and think about this, or if you are in front of a piece of paper, I welcome you
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:52.200]   to take a moment and jot a few names down. I'll wait. Now the number of
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   hammers that you've put on your list will vary greatly depending on your job.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:09.800]   And the types of hammers that you've put on your list will vary greatly
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.720]   depending on your occupation. My guess is if your job has nothing to do with
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.720]   construction or with using a hammer on a daily basis, you probably struggled to
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.840]   know the name of even a single kind of hammer. And you just said, "Well, a hammer,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.440]   the kind that I bang nails in the wall with." But you might not know the
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.360]   distinctions of that hammer and might not know what the type of hammer that you
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.680]   have in the drawer at home is actually called. I noticed a zero headline article
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.840]   a couple days ago called â€“ here was the headline, "Home Depot Panics Over
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.440]   Millennials Forced to Host Tutorials on Using Tape Measures and Hammering Nails."
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.240]   It was interesting just to demonstrate the lack of proficiency with basic DIY
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.520]   and home construction tasks that many young men and women have. Very different
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.240]   perhaps than past generations. So if you are one of a young person who doesn't
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.440]   have a job related to swinging a hammer, you probably struggled to come up with
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   the name of the hammer you're picturing in your head. But if I gave you some time
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.800]   and you did this experiment, you could probably at least come up with something
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.200]   like a sledgehammer, right? There's two types of hammers. Or perhaps some of the
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.000]   hammers that have funny names, maybe you thought of something like a ball-peen
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.200]   hammer or a rubber mallet. These are things that many of us have seen and
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.320]   many of us have used. Now if you have a job or occupation that's not basic
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.800]   carpentry but does involve a hammer, you might have thought of some of the types
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.120]   of hammers that are unique to your business. For example, there's a lineman's
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.600]   hammer that's used to drive in big screws and bolts for those who are working on
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.200]   utility poles. Or if you were interested in jewelry, you would think of something
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.520]   called a chasing hammer, a very small hammer that's used to design and shape
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.000]   metal jewelry. Or perhaps in welding, you would think of a welder's hammer, which
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.880]   is a funny-looking hammer that has a spring for a handle so that it helps to
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.720]   make the metal hammer more comfortable to use and also so that the heat doesn't
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.760]   build up. Or perhaps you thought of an electrician's hammer or a drywall hammer
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   which has a small little axe blade on the back that's used for breaking
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.680]   pieces of drywall board and a smooth head on the actual head of the
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.440]   hammer so that you can set in drywall nails without actually breaking the
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.640]   paper. And there are many, many, many varieties beyond that. Many occupations
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.240]   have uniquely designed hammers that are useful in that occupation. Or if your
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.200]   occupation is one that is very focused on the use of a hammer and it's not just
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640]   peripheral, you could talk to me for quite a while about the different
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.720]   designs of hammers. For example, in carpentry, you'll find hammers,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.480]   you'll find a trim hammer, you'll find a framing hammer, you'll have various sizes
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.240]   of sledgehammers, and there are different ways that these are all adjusted. The
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.600]   face of a hammer in some cases is smooth, which is useful for certain types of
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.760]   nailing, but then oftentimes a framing hammer will have a face that is
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.000]   checkered, which is useful in different contexts but not appropriate for
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.800]   finishing. Or the claw might be curved or straight. A straight claw is more useful
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.520]   for ripping function, but a curved claw is more useful for removing nails. The
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.360]   handles are made of different materials. You might have a handle that's made of
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.840]   metal, and of course there'd be different kinds. Maybe it's titanium. Or you might
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   have a handle that's made of wood, and a wood one is more comfortable to use,
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.240]   passes less vibration through, but it's not quite as durable and it doesn't give
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.600]   you quite the same blow that perhaps a metal handle would would give you. Or
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.520]   even something like a sledgehammer. There would be, of course, different sizes of
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.440]   sledgehammers. You could have an 8-pound sledge or 12-pound sledge or a
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.720]   20-pound sledge, and their handle length will vary and the handle construction
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.920]   will vary. What's my point in this discussion of hammers? Each of these
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.000]   hammers has the same basic function, the application of force to a concentrated
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.520]   area. That's what a hammer basically does. And if we put out every single one of
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.080]   these kinds of hammers on a table, you would identify each of them as a hammer.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.840]   But they're all in a family. Now these hammers have different applications and
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.440]   thus some will be used far more than others. A heavy sledgehammer, a 14-pound
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.400]   sledgehammer, a 20-pound sledgehammer, is very rarely, for a carpenter, gonna be
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.560]   pulled out of the truck. That's really only there to drive a big heavy stake in
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.040]   the ground for a carpenter. Whereas a framing hammer or just a standard
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.880]   curved claw hammer will be on that carpenters tool belt each and every day,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.120]   and he'll be using it constantly. Financial tools and financial products
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:27.440]   are no different than hammers. They are merely tools that can be used to
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.280]   accomplish certain objectives. And there's a wide variety among these types
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.840]   of tools. Some financial tools are very closely related. For example, if something
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.640]   is called life insurance, you can bet that it'll pay a death benefit when
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:54.360]   somebody dies. But the actual design of a life insurance policy, who's insured, who
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.680]   owns it, how many people are insured, who the beneficiaries are, the actual
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.600]   fundamental structure of the policy, the terms and conditions under which it pays
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.480]   out a death benefit, how long it lasts, whether or not it accumulates a cash
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:16.520]   value and under what terms those cash value accumulates, these are all features
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.960]   which are applicable in certain situations and are not applicable in
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.120]   others. The key is to look at the features and compare them to the
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:35.320]   benefits that you're trying to achieve. There are some financial tools that are
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:43.080]   broadly applicable. A 20-year level term life insurance policy is, in the tool
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.200]   belt of a competent insurance advisor and financial planner, a broadly useful
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:56.400]   tool. Think of it like a claw hammer. You can do a lot of good work with a claw
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.080]   hammer, and you can do a lot of good work with a 20-year level term life insurance
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.520]   policy. It's a useful tool. A well-managed, professionally run mutual
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.200]   fund is a useful tool. It has certain characteristics, certain features, and
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:22.560]   it's broadly useful in the tool belt of a financial advisor. But these are not
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.000]   the only tools, and they're not the only tools that you need. It wouldn't be
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.640]   uncommon for a carpenter to have a dozen hammers. That wouldn't be
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.160]   uncommon. And they may use two or three of them constantly. They have their
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.080]   favorite wooden-handled hammer when they are pounding a lot of nails and they
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:50.400]   just need a nice curved claw for useful, just general work. They might have a very
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.200]   light hammer for when their hands get tired, and then they have their big
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.960]   framing hammer. And those three hammers account for, say, 80% of the use. But
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:04.560]   the 16-pound sledge still needs to be in the truck. The tack hammer is useful when
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.240]   doing a little bit of final trim work, and the nail gun is used every day, as is
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.040]   the power hammer when installing flooring. These all have their place, and
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.840]   that's how you should view financial products. They have their place. Financial
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.160]   products are not, in and of themselves, good or bad any more than a ball-peen
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:33.840]   hammer is a bad hammer. Financial products are good or bad based upon the
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.720]   appropriateness of their fit to a specific circumstance. If you're closing
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.240]   up a rivet doing some metalworking, a lightweight ball-peen hammer is exactly
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:50.560]   what you want. But if you bring that out on demo day and try to knock out a 2x4
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:59.200]   stud in a wall as part of a demolition project with it, you will find your work
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.720]   non-progressing. For that work, you need the sledge and the framing hammer on
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:12.280]   your tool belt. So what can you, as a non-financial professional, do? Well, first
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.480]   of all, trust your gut. You know what a hammer looks like. You know what a life
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:24.920]   insurance policy is. And you know when you use these things. So trust your gut.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.760]   Trust the people that have given you advice. When somebody gives you advice,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.320]   there's probably something to it. But also be open to talking with those who are
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:40.120]   experts in their area. Be open to talking with those who can share with you why
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.960]   you might choose one type of handle on your hammer versus another and why the
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:50.480]   curve of the claw makes a difference. Don't reject something out of hand just
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.000]   because you're not familiar with it. But don't accept it forthwith
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.360]   simply because somebody has presented it to you. Ask as many good questions as you
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:10.800]   can. Get advice from as many experienced people as you can. What you'll find is
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.440]   there are some levels of personal preference. You might be talking to two
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.160]   grizzled carpentry veterans and looking at their hammers and recognize that they
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.360]   have slightly different hammers that they choose to wear on their tool belt
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.240]   every day. One prefers one that's heavier. One prefers one that's lighter. But
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.920]   there's probably going to understand one another. Just because two people would
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:40.440]   choose two different things doesn't make one right or one wrong. Sometimes there's
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.160]   a personal preference. On the other hand, sometimes there is a clear gap between
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:54.080]   the application and the tool. You can use a round rock to drive a nail into a
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.360]   piece of wood if that's all you've got. But we invented hammers for a reason. If
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.120]   somebody's trying to sell you a round rock as an ideal tool for you to use
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:14.720]   every day, run. This show is part of the Radical Life Media network of podcasts
