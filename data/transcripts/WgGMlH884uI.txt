[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.280]   Today, we're welcoming back our special guest, Dr. Ed Yardeni.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120]   Dr. Yardeni is the president of Yardeni Research,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.440]   a provider of global investment strategy and asset allocation
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.440]   analysis and recommendations to institutional investors.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.660]   Dr. Yardeni earned his PhD in economics
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.240]   from Yale University in 1976, having
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.640]   completed his doctoral dissertation under Nobel
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280]   Laureate James Tobin.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.200]   He previously received his master's
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.240]   in international relations from Yale
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.040]   and completed his undergraduate studies magna cum laude
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.720]   at Cornell University.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.320]   Prior to opening his own firm in 2007,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.880]   Dr. Yardeni was a chief investment strategist
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.200]   and a chief economist at several Wall Street firms and asset
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.360]   management firms.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.040]   He was also an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.740]   York, and he held positions at the Federal Reserve Board
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.640]   of Governors and the US Treasury Department in Washington, DC.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600]   He also taught at Columbia University's Graduate School
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.840]   of Business.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.020]   Dr. Yardeni is frequently quoted in the financial press,
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.400]   including the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.040]   the New York Times, and most recently in a cover story
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.480]   for Barron's when he was dubbed the Wall Street seer.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.360]   Today, we'll be discussing Dr. Yardeni's newest book,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.280]   In Praise of Profits.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   We'll also be talking about the economy, where we've been,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   and where he thinks we may be going.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Ed Yardeni.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.080]   Welcome to the podcast, Ed.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.160]   Ed, thank you for joining us today.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.280]   You've published a couple more books
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.400]   since I talked with you last.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.280]   The latest book that you wrote I found very interesting.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.320]   It's called In Praise of Profits.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.660]   This book is just the latest in a series of topical studies
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.520]   that you've done, starting with the yield curve,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.700]   stock buybacks, Fed watching, two books on Fed watching,
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.360]   and also S&P earnings and valuation and the pandemic.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.640]   And this all followed your original book
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.880]   on predicting the markets of professional autobiography.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.480]   So I want to specifically focus on this book, though,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.720]   because I found it very interesting.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.880]   It's really something that I think
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.720]   has been bothering me as an investor
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   and I think clearly has been bothering you also.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.040]   It's about profits.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.720]   We've had a lot of discussion in the media,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.200]   and I can't get too political in this podcast,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.120]   but there's a difference of opinion, if you will,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.980]   about profits and where we should be going as a nation.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.680]   And what you intend to do with the book is to clear that up,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.120]   at least from your view as an economist.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.040]   So with that, could you tell us
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.320]   what the main idea of the book was?
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.880]   - Sure, I've observed over the years
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   that profits tend to be the driver of economic prosperity.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.760]   I mean, it's really pretty simple and straightforward
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.200]   to see it, to observe that it's profitable companies
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.780]   that expand, they hire more workers,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.540]   they expand their capacity, so they're ordering more goods,
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.160]   capital equipment, and so on.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.120]   Whereas companies that are not doing so well
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.800]   or actually losing money have to retrench.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.200]   They have to cut back employment.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.120]   They have to try to sell off some of their assets.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.720]   And the more profitable companies we have,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.560]   the better the overall economy is gonna do,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.320]   the better overall society will do.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.800]   'Cause again, it's profitable firms that hire people,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.120]   and that's the name of the game
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.900]   when we're talking about economic prosperity.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.440]   We're not rooting for companies themselves
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.600]   to be prosperous and no one else will be prosperous.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.440]   And obviously, companies can't be prosperous
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.640]   if their customers aren't prosperous.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.160]   So this is sort of a defense
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.620]   of what I call entrepreneurial capitalism,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.040]   which I think needs to be distinguished always
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.820]   from crony capitalism.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.440]   There's aspects of capitalism
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.380]   that I certainly don't agree with, don't favor,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.800]   and I criticize in the book.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.720]   But on the other hand, the entrepreneurial capitalism
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.760]   often gets kind of wrapped up into that conversation
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.560]   and gets misrepresented as based on greed,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.360]   on selfishness, on exploitation of workers.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.360]   And the reality is, that's not the reality of our economy.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.840]   - Ed, you touched on right away
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080]   on the difference between entrepreneurial capitalism
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.000]   and crony capitalism.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.360]   And I'd like you to dig into that a little bit more.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.240]   I mean, what is the difference?
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.680]   - In a word, lobbyists.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.520]   (laughs)
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.340]   - Okay.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.180]   (laughs)
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.620]   - To keep it real simple,
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.620]   I am an entrepreneurial capitalist.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.660]   I do pretty well.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.340]   I've got a small company, I've got employees,
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.420]   but I'm not doing so well where I have extra money
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.420]   to hire lawyers and lobbyists
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.940]   to work with politicians in Washington
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.860]   to try to protect my business.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.700]   - That's what it really gets down to, correct?
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.900]   - Yeah, politics.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.500]   Yeah, I mean, I don't get involved in politics.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.700]   I get involved in trying to satisfy my customers,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.860]   whereas crony capitalists have done so well
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.940]   that they forget that it was entrepreneurial capitalism
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.100]   that gave them their success and their wealth,
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.820]   and it was their focus on their customers
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.300]   that made them successful.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.620]   And it's sad when entrepreneurial capitalists do so well
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.340]   that they morph into crony capitalists
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.060]   by relying more and more on the government
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.220]   to create regulatory impediments to competitors
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.860]   to compete with them, to put them out of business even.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.140]   - Now, would some of that be in defense of retaining jobs?
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.780]   - Well, that always is the excuse, right?
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.980]   Is the reason that the government
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.020]   needs to subsidize my business,
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.700]   or the reason the government needs to protect my business
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.100]   from both domestic and foreign competition
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.300]   is because if the government doesn't do that,
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.860]   then I'm gonna have to shut down
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.660]   and all these people that I employ will lose their jobs.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.380]   I mean, that's a valid concern.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.220]   But if we let that determine who the winners are
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.740]   and who the losers are,
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.300]   then it's not gonna be the customers
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.220]   that make that decision.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.260]   It's gonna be politicians and companies
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260]   that interact through lobbyists
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.220]   that will decide who succeeds and who doesn't.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.220]   And that's fundamentally to the detriment
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.020]   of who I'm trying to satisfy
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.740]   and make as well off as possible, and that's consumers.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.140]   Sometimes it's better to let the market make the decisions,
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.260]   even if it's painful,
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.500]   because the ultimate result is good for consumers
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.900]   and good for even the employees that may lose jobs
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.580]   and find them with companies that are better managed
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.620]   and better aimed at satisfying their customers.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.020]   - More sustainable, perhaps.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.860]   - Yeah.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.540]   - What I took away from your book,
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.660]   and I hadn't really realized this,
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.660]   huge number of S-corps, sole proprietors,
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.940]   partnerships relative to C-corp.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.780]   - Right.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.460]   - And the breakdown of national income
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.900]   between the large C-corps,
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.500]   well, not all of them are large,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.860]   to S-corps and solo practitioners.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.220]   So could you elaborate on that?
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.460]   - Yeah, well, in corporate profits,
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.260]   the data that comes out with GDP,
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.980]   that is the corporate profits
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.340]   of both C-corporations and S-corporations.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.300]   C-corporations tend to be large, but not always.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.820]   There's plenty of small C-corporations,
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.100]   but they're owned by shareholders,
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.580]   and they pay out dividends, and they're taxed twice.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.420]   They're taxed on their profits,
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.740]   and then the shareholders are taxed on their dividends.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.580]   S-corporations are so-called pass-through entities,
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.540]   and what that means is that they're owned
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.980]   by fewer shareholders, which is one of the requirements,
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.980]   and if they pass the IRS requirements
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.900]   for filing S-corporations as pass-throughs,
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.380]   then their profits show up in the national income accounts,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.500]   but their profits are then paid out as dividends
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.980]   to their small number of shareholders,
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.020]   and then the shareholders pay their personal income taxes
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.100]   on those dividends.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.700]   So they're pass-throughs, and there are quite a few of them,
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.660]   and there's even more sole proprietorships
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.220]   that are owned by only one person,
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.100]   and also are pass-throughs.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.980]   Whatever profit they have is passed through
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.180]   to their proprietor.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.340]   They don't pay any corporate tax.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.380]   They just pay personal income tax on proprietor's income,
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.660]   and then there's partnerships,
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.700]   which are also included in the data,
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.860]   and when you add them all together,
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.660]   you find out that pass-throughs,
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.340]   including S and proprietorships and partnerships,
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.660]   the pass-throughs account for more than half
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.660]   of payroll employment in the United States,
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.540]   and they've been growing very rapidly,
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.740]   which is an indication to me
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.860]   that a lot of people are entrepreneurial
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.580]   in spirit and in action.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.860]   A lot of people have decided
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.380]   they don't want to work for somebody else.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.100]   They want to have their own company,
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.900]   and they start their own company,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.660]   and as long as they succeed,
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.180]   at some point, they probably need to hire people.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.580]   In the old days, the United Kingdom was often described
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.380]   as a nation of retailers, of small shops, of shopkeepers.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.820]   We really have continued to evolve
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.700]   into a nation of proprietorships
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.420]   and S corporations and partnerships.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.940]   Those are all entrepreneurs.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.900]   Very few of them are in a position
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.940]   where they can go hire lobbyists
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.060]   and get political about their business.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.300]   - So as these entrepreneurs are successful,
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.260]   and they start to grow,
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.380]   and they start hiring people,
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.100]   and some of them become publicly traded companies,
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.540]   it seems like at that point,
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.660]   they tend to become villainized in many ways
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.340]   because of this thing called income inequality.
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.260]   In other words, the people who grew that company
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.260]   and went public, and yes, they became wealthy as a result,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.740]   somehow don't deserve that wealth,
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.380]   and that wealth needs to be shared
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.380]   with the "stakeholders" as opposed to the shareholders.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.660]   Can you talk about the difference
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.340]   between stakeholders and shareholders?
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.780]   - Well, first, with regards to the income inequality issue,
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.660]   a lot of the income inequality we see in our society
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.660]   has a lot to do with demography.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.980]   Frankly, simply with age.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.300]   I mean, young people don't earn very much,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.500]   and older people tend to earn a lot more,
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.820]   and that kind of makes sense
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.140]   that that's the way it should be
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.900]   'cause young people aren't experienced.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.660]   They may be very well-educated,
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.660]   but they aren't particularly experienced,
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.340]   particularly in the business
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.580]   that they eventually wind up joining,
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.900]   and older people have more skin in the game
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.220]   and develop more,
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.060]   so it's true that there's income inequality,
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.860]   but a lot of it's related to where you are
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.820]   in the age profile,
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.980]   and it's generally younger people
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.860]   that go out on their own and start companies
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.940]   and take some risks,
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.220]   and if they're successful,
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.060]   then they start to hire,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.620]   and if they're very successful,
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.140]   they start to enjoy some significant wealth,
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.220]   and odds are they're going to reinvest
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.540]   a good part of that wealth back into their business
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.540]   and hire some more people,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.540]   but as they do that,
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.220]   their companies become more valuable,
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.020]   their shareholders in their companies.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.900]   They might even go public,
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.620]   which increases potentially the value of their company.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.540]   I mean, very few entrepreneurs are going to go public
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.500]   unless a Wall Street investment banker tells them
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.460]   that your stock price is going to value your company
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.340]   a lot more than you realize,
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.860]   and so yeah, they get wealthy,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.340]   and most of the wealth inequality
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.900]   is related to equity ownership of businesses
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.220]   by sole proprietors,
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.340]   as well as equity ownership of publicly-traded companies
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.620]   like C-Corporations,
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.780]   but as you said,
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.140]   when we look at the notion
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.620]   that entrepreneurs are robber barons,
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.420]   which is sort of historically
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.540]   what entrepreneurs have been described as being
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.420]   once they've succeeded,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.580]   completely misses that their success
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.060]   originated from the fact
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.820]   that they provided goods and services
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.700]   that were wanted, that were needed,
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.820]   that were highly prized by their customers,
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.700]   by their consumers.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.660]   It's their customers that made them rich.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.220]   They didn't rip off their workers.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.700]   They didn't rip off their customers.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.860]   I mean, people like that
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.780]   don't stay in business for very long,
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.020]   not in a free marketplace
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.300]   'cause the consumers walk away from them
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.340]   and their workers walk away from them.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.460]   They only stay in business
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.420]   if they got political clout and political support,
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.860]   but we have some of that,
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.260]   but we also have lots of entrepreneurship,
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.340]   and what we have to understand about entrepreneurs
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.100]   is that they are driven by the profit motive
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.020]   to bring us goods and services
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.420]   that improve our standard of living.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.300]   That's the way they're gonna get rich.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.620]   So first and foremost,
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.740]   their top concern isn't a selfish concern,
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.980]   isn't that how am I gonna get rich?
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.380]   It's how am I gonna satisfy enough consumers
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.180]   so I first will stay in business
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.700]   and I won't lose everything I put into it.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.820]   Then all of a sudden they say,
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.100]   "My goodness, I've done it."
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.660]   And the customer is just coming in
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.300]   and it's gone viral.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.420]   People are talking to each other and saying,
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.140]   "This is a good product."
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.820]   And suddenly I'm rich.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.700]   Now, some of these people who get very rich,
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.700]   what do they do?
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.820]   As I said, they put it back in their business.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.380]   Others get so rich that they become venture capitalists.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.820]   They send some of their money to firms in Silicon Valley
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   and say, "Okay, that's a pretty good idea.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.340]   "I'm gonna invest in that."
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.180]   And so they are the wellhead of prosperity.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.580]   They are the wellhead of risk-taking
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.260]   and the willingness to try to come up
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.660]   with goods and services
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.940]   that increase everybody's standard of living.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.780]   - You talk in your book about upward income mobility.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.300]   - Well, I think most Americans are aspirational.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.620]   Most Americans would like to do better.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.260]   And I think a lot of upward income mobility
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.140]   has to do with an entrepreneurial capital system.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.940]   It provides the opportunity
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.580]   to have upward income mobility.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.580]   Work hard, provide what your employer needs you to provide
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.380]   to make their business succeed,
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.420]   or do that as an employer.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.140]   Work hard, motivate your employees
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.420]   and sell good products and services that consumers want,
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.500]   and you wind up enjoying upward income mobility.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.140]   Now, upward income mobility tends to occur
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.940]   during periods of prosperity.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.980]   More people wind up making more in an economy
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.580]   that's growing and prospering than one that isn't.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.100]   We actually get the worst income inequality
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.780]   and the worst wealth inequality
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.140]   during periods of prosperity
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.300]   when the rich are getting richer.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.540]   But why are they getting richer?
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.540]   Well, because people are buying what they're selling
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.780]   and they wind up doing extremely well.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.380]   But again, it's like the Henry Ford insight.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.700]   Henry Ford decided to raise the money he pays his workers
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.660]   'cause he wanted to make sure he had enough customers
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.860]   who could afford to buy his cars.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.740]   We're well past that point in our economy and our society,
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.780]   but it's definitely in the best interest of entrepreneurs
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.540]   to come up with outstanding goods and services
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.700]   that'll make them prosperous,
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.700]   and then to share their prosperity.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.340]   The market kind of forces them to do that.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.500]   Maybe they don't do it completely by design
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.460]   or they're not completely motivated to do that,
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.780]   but the market definitely forces them
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.940]   to share the wealth with their employees,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.340]   with their shareholders, and with society at large
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.540]   by providing these goods and services
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.740]   at lower and lower prices.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.860]   - When we're listening to the news media
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.620]   about income inequality,
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.460]   what we're not told, it appears,
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.500]   is that there are different ways to measure income.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:26.220]   And just using a minimum wage, for example,
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.740]   is not a great way to measure income.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.980]   - Right.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.660]   - Just using income is not a great way
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.820]   to measure wealth, either.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.700]   I know a lot of people who are multimillionaires
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.340]   who are getting Affordable Care Act tax credits
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.740]   because their income is low,
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.020]   and the government says if you have low income,
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.900]   then you are in poverty or some level of poverty,
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.500]   even though it doesn't measure wealth.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.180]   So could you talk about the problems of measuring income
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.980]   and the different ways of which we should be measuring it?
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.820]   - Well, on the progressive side,
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.140]   I've observed over the years
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.140]   that they do like to show
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.580]   that there's data that support their position,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.580]   but they always seem to use the same series
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.500]   over and over again without recognizing the flaws
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.740]   in the data they're using.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.860]   And I think it's mostly because the data supports
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.340]   their story, and as long as it supports that story,
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.340]   the data must be good.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.580]   But I've done a lot of work on income data
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.860]   and concluded that one series that they particularly like
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.340]   is one put out by the census to measure poverty,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.340]   and that is it's median household income.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.220]   So it's the household in the middle, if you will,
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.220]   median household income, and that's divided by the CPI.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.340]   Now, there's several problems with that.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.220]   For starters, the census data is based on surveys.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.580]   They ask people, how much money income do you have?
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.780]   Are you making?
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.900]   And so they're basically asking,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.340]   collecting data on an income series that is pre-tax,
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.900]   so it doesn't include any of the tax credits
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.180]   that progressives have succeeded
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.100]   in putting into the tax system,
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.620]   doesn't reflect the progressiveness of the tax system,
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.260]   doesn't reflect non-money sources of income
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.780]   like Medicaid and Medicare and food stamps.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.460]   So you're never gonna win that debate
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.660]   because that series is always gonna show
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.260]   that the median household isn't doing very well
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.820]   if you don't factor in all the programs
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.900]   that the progressives have successfully provided.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.780]   In the book, I try to be balanced.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.900]   I try to be fair to the progressives.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.660]   They've accomplished a great deal.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.780]   I mean, social security,
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.460]   nobody argues about that really anymore.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.860]   And we've got Medicaid and Medicare.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.460]   There's a lot that they've accomplished,
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.420]   but if they don't show that in the data that they're using,
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:03.180]   they're always gonna be finding fault with the system.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.740]   And so that's one problem.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.380]   The CPI tends to be upwardly biased.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.220]   It's widely recognized by economists
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.740]   that it's upwardly biased.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.580]   And there are other measures that economists,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.900]   particularly the Fed has endorsed
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.460]   the personal consumption expenditure deflator
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.100]   as an alternative to the CPI.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.420]   And when you use that indicator,
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.620]   you find that real incomes have increased
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.620]   about one to 1.5% per year since 1995,
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.980]   whereas the data series that the progressives
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.340]   have been promoting basically stagnated
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.180]   over that whole period.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.420]   You're still gonna hear progressives
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.220]   just kind of blurred out, unchallenged,
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.060]   that the data confirms that the average family,
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.180]   the median family has seen their income stagnate
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.500]   for decades and that all of the benefits
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.740]   of economic growth have gone to corporations
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   and the wealthy.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.180]   And that's just not correct.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.740]   It's just not true.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.740]   The reality is there has been no stagnation in real wages.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.940]   - One thing that's in the sites of the proposed tax bill
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.580]   is this idea of corporate buybacks
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.740]   and how stock buybacks are a bad thing
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.220]   and that this money should be going to the workers
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.580]   and the stakeholders instead of the shareholders.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.740]   You wrote a whole book on this.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.500]   Can you tell us some insight?
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.140]   - Well, we don't really have particularly good data
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.460]   on buybacks.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.580]   What I do see is that when we look at the S&P 500
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.060]   and we look at the growth rate on a year over year basis
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.060]   in earnings per share versus the total earnings,
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.580]   aggregate earnings of these corporations,
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.620]   what we find is that it's not much of a difference.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.860]   In other words, are companies really spending
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.700]   hundreds of billions of dollars to buy back their shares
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.980]   and on balance, the S&P 500 winds up only getting
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.980]   a boost of about 1% per year from this buyback activity.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.420]   Now, the problem is that's the macro picture.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.060]   When you actually dig down and look at the S&P 500,
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.140]   there are in fact lots of companies
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.100]   that buy back their shares
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.820]   and that significantly increases their earnings per share
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.180]   because there are fewer shares outstanding.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.180]   But then there's also a lot of other companies
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.180]   where the buybacks don't seem to be having that effect.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.940]   What we don't really have good data on,
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.620]   but we know anecdotally it exists,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.060]   is companies do pay their employees
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.900]   some of their compensation in stock and in stock options.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.780]   And it's not just the top three or four or five people
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.420]   that are part of these plans.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.580]   And I think what happens is when companies like that
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.740]   pay out compensation in stock to avoid dilution,
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.940]   to avoid reducing their earnings per share
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.260]   because there's more stock being issued as compensation,
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.580]   they turn it right around and take the money,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.940]   the cash that they didn't pay out as cash for compensation
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.660]   and buy back the shares so that net net,
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.780]   it doesn't have an adverse impact
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.540]   on their earnings per share.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.660]   And I think there's quite a few companies that do that.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.860]   So I don't think we wanna discourage companies
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.060]   from paying some of their compensation in stock
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.420]   because it does give employees skin in the game
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.700]   and it does give them a benefit.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.420]   I mean, the reality is the stock market
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.180]   has been trending higher for years
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.180]   and employees who've been benefiting compensation plans
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.140]   by getting some of their pay in stock
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.500]   have done extremely well.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.340]   And I don't think we wanna discourage that.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.940]   I also don't think that Washington should get involved
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.140]   in micromanaging corporate financial matters.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.900]   It should really be up to corporations
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.380]   to deal with that.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.020]   Having said all that, I do recognize
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.140]   that there is a problem of some CEOs
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.660]   being egregiously overpaid.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.300]   So again, it's not as though I disagree
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.580]   with everything progressives have to say.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.900]   I think they are right that there are some CEOs
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.900]   that are egregiously overpaid,
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.460]   but I think it's really up to the shareholders
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   or if Congress wants to get involved in that area,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.220]   they've already have done that and messed things up.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.380]   It was back in Bill Clinton's administration
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.380]   that Congress were very concerned
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.500]   about CEOs making too much money.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.900]   And what they did is they said,
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.140]   okay, up to a million dollars in compensation per CEO
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.620]   is tax deductible to the corporation.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.220]   Anything above that isn't.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.020]   So corporations started issuing stock and stock options
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.460]   to these CEOs who got famously rich
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.660]   thanks to this progressive legislative change.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.740]   So beware of what you wish for,
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.380]   beware of unintended consequences
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.380]   when you meddle around with the economy.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.820]   - But unlike stock that's just bought back
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.340]   to increase earnings per share,
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.780]   stock that's bought to basically get reissued to employees,
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.580]   this is an expense item.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.420]   - Yes.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.260]   - This doesn't get away.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.940]   - That's correct, it's an expense item.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.980]   Let's just take, I don't know,
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.220]   somebody who's making 100,000,
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.660]   you give the employee 10,000 or 20,000 in stock.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.900]   So instead of paying out 10 to $20,000 in cash,
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.140]   you take that cash and go and buy the stock in the market
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.140]   so that you're not diluting earnings per share.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.900]   So absolutely, the full 100,000 is expensed
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.020]   from the corporate income statement.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.860]   - So mostly you think what half of all stock buybacks
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.620]   are basically expensed like it would be a salary?
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.980]   - It's hard to say.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.900]   The data I've seen, which is very flimsy data,
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.260]   is something like 20, 25% of employees
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.660]   get some sort of stock compensation,
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.060]   which is a pretty large number of people.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.700]   You can't account for those kind of numbers
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.460]   with just a couple of the people at the top.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.060]   - But overall, you do know,
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.020]   you did see that stock buybacks in the aggregate
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.820]   maybe increase earnings per share by 1% per year.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.780]   - Correct.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.180]   - But what percentage of the stock market
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.460]   is being bought back every year?
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.180]   Was it at 3%, 4%?
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.900]   - Something like that, yeah.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.740]   - So could we-- - Yeah, I mean,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.980]   the market cap is huge.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.580]   - So could we reasonably say then
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.580]   that at least half of all buybacks, maybe even more,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.140]   is just going towards compensation that's expensed?
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.580]   - It's a real possibility.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.660]   I just don't, I like to have the data to make my point.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.940]   I mean, I'd love to say that and say,
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.980]   this insight proves my point,
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.900]   but I can't really prove it with the data.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.140]   So at this point, I'd rather just say
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.020]   that what I do believe is,
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.100]   I have some data confirming the story,
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.100]   is that something like 25% of working people
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:17.380]   get some participation in a stock compensation plan.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.060]   - Okay, fair enough.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.980]   But this is a target now of Washington.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.980]   I mean, some people in Washington have decided
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.500]   that stock buybacks, for whatever reason,
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.380]   are not a good thing for America.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.020]   - Yeah, they believe that the corporations
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.220]   should be taking that money
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.940]   and spending more on capital equipment
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.940]   and productivity and wages.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.220]   They've often compared the amount of money
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.180]   that's spent on buybacks to corporate profits
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.060]   and said, "My God, it's 100%.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.980]   "100% of corporate profits is going to buybacks."
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.780]   And buybacks plus dividends
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.820]   account for 100% of corporate profits.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.460]   What they don't seem to appreciate
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.740]   is a basic accounting statistic in corporate finance,
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.100]   and that is corporate cash flows
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.940]   equal to after-tax corporate profits plus depreciation.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.300]   And depreciation is huge, much bigger than corporate profits.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.780]   So companies have been spending,
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.500]   we've got record capital spending going on,
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.180]   even as we've had sizable buybacks.
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.460]   So where did all that money come from
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.100]   for the capital spending?
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.540]   And the answer is, well, it's cash flow.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.140]   It's cash flow, to a large extent,
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.300]   based on the depreciation allowance,
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.460]   which is essentially a tax shelter
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.940]   so that you can write off assets that are depreciating
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.900]   and have money to reinvest in newer equipment.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.540]   - The proposal that went to the Senate recently
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:45.180]   said that there will be a 1% tax imposed
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.260]   on all corporate buybacks, with some exceptions,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.820]   stock that goes into an ESOP plan and a few other things.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.900]   Don't you think that if that actually passed,
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.060]   that corporations would change the way they do things
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.060]   as far as compensation to their employees,
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.580]   that 25%, which is currently getting stock?
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.300]   - No, it's a piddling number,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.740]   but it's really just opening the door
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.380]   to Washington having more say
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.260]   in the way corporations manage their finances,
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.220]   which makes no sense whatsoever
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.300]   since very few politicians in Washington
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.300]   have ever managed a company
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.140]   or should have any say in managing a company.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.500]   Again, it gets to the concept
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.460]   of shareholder versus stakeholders.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.420]   Congress, I guess, views itself,
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.980]   or some politicians view themselves as stakeholders
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.740]   in every corporation in America,
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.500]   that somehow they have a right to meddle
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.780]   and to tell corporations what they should be doing
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.180]   with their finances, with their employment,
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.860]   with their capital spending, with their productivity.
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.380]   But that makes no sense.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.620]   That's not the way the system's supposed to work.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.860]   It's supposed to be a capitalistic system,
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.820]   and shareholders should be the ones overseeing
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.900]   what their businesses are doing.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.660]   - The name of the book called "In Praise of Profits,"
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.180]   and it's just a treasure trove of some great information
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.740]   about income and the measurement of income
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.380]   and different profits and the uses of profits and so forth,
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.380]   and it just adds to your knowledge about how America works.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.260]   And I think that the best thing,
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.020]   I guess I can just sum it up with just one line
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.820]   that you wrote actually in the last page of the book.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.860]   And you basically said,
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.900]   "Most Americans have never been better off
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.500]   "than they are today thanks to record profits
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.140]   "and record productivity,
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.540]   "which are fueling widespread prosperity."
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.020]   Do you wanna comment on that?
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.940]   - Well, that line really does encapsulate
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.940]   the whole point of the book is that we should praise profits
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.140]   rather than curse profits.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.860]   Profits is not a four-letter word.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.500]   Profits really is the source of economic prosperity.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.420]   The profit motive drives businesses
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.300]   to provide the very best goods and services
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.540]   at the lowest price relative to the competitors.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.540]   But it's important that they have competitors.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.980]   It's important that we don't corrupt the system
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.820]   with crony capitalism, with too much politics.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.060]   I mean, it's kind of too late for that.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.340]   It's already happened.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.300]   But it's important that we allow entrepreneurs
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.980]   to constantly challenge that system,
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.780]   to come out of nowhere with better goods and services
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.940]   at lower prices and say,
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.980]   "See, I can do this better than these big companies
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.020]   "who've been established and doing it for a long time,
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.300]   "and yet aren't giving you the kind of quality
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.020]   "or prices that the consumer really should have."
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.980]   So yeah, the whole focus of the book
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.300]   is that we need to have a lot more respect for profits
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.260]   and a lot better understanding of the role of profits
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.460]   in creating the prosperity that we've all enjoyed.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.580]   And I would hope that some people
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.900]   would re-examine their assumptions,
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.420]   'cause it's widely believed that Americans aren't well-off,
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.340]   that their incomes have stagnated,
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.620]   that their standard of living is pathetic,
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.380]   and that income inequality has gotten so bad
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.540]   that only a few people really are enjoying the benefits
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.940]   of this great country, and that's just not so.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.620]   - Well, thanks, that's a great summary.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.420]   Let's get into the economy.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.260]   - Sure.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.540]   - And what happened in 2021?
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.900]   Where are we now?
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.700]   And where do you think we're going in 2022?
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.380]   And let's start with corporate profits.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.220]   - Right.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.540]   The corporate profits have been remarkably strong.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:33.020]   They've come back dramatically on a year-over-year basis.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.180]   In the second quarter, we were up like 90%.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.180]   That reflects the fact that they were extremely depressed
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:44.180]   during the second quarter of 2020 because of the lockdowns.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.740]   But it's really quite extraordinary
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.420]   the extent to which corporate profits have made a comeback.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.940]   Corporate profit margins have gone to all-time record highs,
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.940]   and the stock market anticipated that.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.340]   And as you might recall,
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.060]   there were a lot of people in the media
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.300]   who were kind of like looking at the stock market
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.060]   and said, "This is not right.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.700]   "I mean, why is the stock market having such a good time
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.980]   "when the economy is doing so terribly?"
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.260]   And the reality is corporate profits
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.420]   underneath of all that were rebounding dramatically.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.340]   And as corporate profits rebounded, guess what?
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.420]   Companies started to bring back their employees
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.940]   and started to expand again.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.220]   And so it's all come together rather nicely.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.220]   I think 2021 is a year where the demand shock
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:32.660]   that was created by excessively stimulative fiscal
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.300]   and monetary policies created a supply disruption shock.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.060]   I think that's really what's been happening in 2021
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.500]   is it's not that suddenly the supply chain system
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.140]   kind of collapsed for no good reason.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.020]   It just got overwhelmed by demand.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.140]   Look, people had cabin fever from the lockdowns.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.700]   And as soon as the lockdowns were gradually eased,
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.500]   they went out and bought a lot of goods.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.300]   They couldn't buy services, so they bought a lot of goods.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.100]   And then the government sent three rounds of relief checks.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.700]   And I think the first one was necessary.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.100]   The second one, not so much.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.140]   And the third one, I think, created the demand shock
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.940]   that has led to the supply disruptions.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.300]   Just way too much demand relative to the supply system.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.020]   So the supply system has been disrupted
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.620]   and the result has been higher inflation.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.060]   This whole business cycle that we've had
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:28.980]   since we hit a bottom in the second quarter of last year
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.020]   has been like a business cycle on steroid and speed.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.060]   We had a horrible recession last year
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.700]   that only really lasted two months,
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.380]   which was March and April.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.500]   We've never had a lockdown recession.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.060]   And then we've had this extraordinary recovery
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.020]   to the point where we were back to
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.020]   where we started pre-pandemic in record GDP territory
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.820]   by the second quarter of this year.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.700]   And now, as part of this accelerated business cycle,
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.020]   we're seeing something we haven't seen
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.500]   for a very long time.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.820]   And that's a real pickup in inflation.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.220]   - Well, that gets right into my next question.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.060]   Chairman Powell and others have been talking about
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.180]   this transitory inflation versus permanent inflation.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.740]   Of course, they've been trying to get the inflation rate
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.620]   up to 2% for a long time.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.100]   But this transient inflation seems to be pretty sticky now.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.780]   Can you comment on that?
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.460]   - Yeah, it's gone from being transitory to being persistent.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.380]   And the transitory story was being promoted
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.220]   by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said that,
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.540]   "Look, when you do year-over-year comparisons
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.820]   "and you're comparing prices in March and April this year
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.380]   "to March and April last year, guess what?
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.740]   "It's gonna show a lot of inflation
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.180]   "'cause prices were depressed in March, April,
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.940]   "May, June, July of last year.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.140]   "So those year-over-year comparisons
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.380]   "are gonna be distorted by what he called the base effect."
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.980]   But once you got into September, October readings,
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.340]   you couldn't make that argument anymore.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:57.380]   And so he switched, he pivoted to a new concept,
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.980]   which is, well, it's clearly supply chain disruptions
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.980]   that are causing a more persistent inflation
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.980]   than had been anticipated by him and others earlier in 2021.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.020]   And now the pitch is, well,
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.820]   when these supply disruptions get sorted out,
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.100]   inflation should moderate.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.500]   And that kind of makes sense.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.780]   The problem is the longer that they persist
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.100]   and create inflationary pressures, prices,
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.620]   the more that those pressures then get into wages,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.500]   the more there's a risk of a wage price spiral
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.300]   comparable to what we had in the 1970s.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.260]   I don't think that's where we're going.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.780]   1970s productivity collapsed.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.340]   I see a tremendous boom in productivity in the years ahead.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.860]   But for the here and now,
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.780]   we are having unintended consequence
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.380]   of the Fed's ultra easy monetary policy
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.820]   and the tremendous stimulus provided
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.500]   by the fiscal authorities that was deficit financed.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.300]   All that's created a demand shock,
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.540]   which has then created a supply shock,
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.020]   which explains why we have an inflation problem right now.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.900]   And it's distressing because, you know,
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.900]   people are seeing their wages going up in their paychecks
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.540]   'cause workers are in high demand.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.860]   But at the same time, a lot of those wage increases
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.340]   are getting offset by price increases.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.020]   - When I first interviewed you,
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.500]   that's been a couple of years ago,
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.060]   we talked about your book, "Fed Watching for Fun and Profit."
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:32.060]   And you came up with the four Ds for inflation,
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.860]   detente, disruption, demography, and debt.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.780]   So first, could you explain those four?
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.020]   And then also, is there a fifth one now called disease?
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.940]   - Well, perhaps.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.060]   In terms of the four Ds, starting in the early 1980s,
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.300]   until we got to the pandemic environment
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.500]   of seeing inflation making a comeback,
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.860]   I was arguing that there were some major structural forces
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.660]   that were keeping a lid on inflation
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.740]   and were bringing inflation down,
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.100]   creating what some people described as disinflation.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.060]   I was an early disinflationist, I think it was in 1980,
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.540]   I wrote a piece called "On the Road to Disinflation,"
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.860]   arguing that Paul Volcker
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.820]   probably would break the back of inflation
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.340]   and that we'd see lower inflation, not higher inflation.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.580]   And the four Ds, detente is the first one,
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.060]   it's just, I need a word that starts with a D,
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.380]   so to explain globalization.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.940]   So globalization occurs during peace times,
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.900]   markets become more integrated,
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.820]   companies and businesses and countries
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.340]   trade more with each other.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.780]   And during peace times, you get more global competition,
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.740]   which is fundamentally disinflationary.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.780]   Then in a competitive global economy,
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.580]   companies are under a lot of pressure
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.540]   to increase their productivity
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.140]   to offset the competitive advantage of their competitors.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.260]   And so productivity is enhanced
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.900]   through technological disruption,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.540]   so the D is in technological disruption.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.980]   And then there's demography,
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.140]   which is a constantly evolving story,
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.220]   but the way it's been evolving in recent decades
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.380]   suggests that we're not gonna have very much
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.340]   in the way of population growth.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.100]   And meanwhile, populations are gonna get older,
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.220]   more geriatric,
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.620]   and that that is inherently disinflationary.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.980]   And finally, central banks
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.420]   try to offset all of these disinflationary forces
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.660]   by encouraging people to borrow more,
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.460]   so they kept interest rates low,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.340]   they provided very easy monetary policy,
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.620]   so we did in fact see debt accumulation.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.740]   But at some point, debt becomes a burden on growth
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.660]   rather than a stimulus of growth.
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.500]   At some point,
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.420]   a lot of consumers have already done their borrowing,
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.860]   a lot of homeowners have already done their borrowing,
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.260]   and trying to encourage people to borrow more
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.940]   just doesn't seem to work.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.100]   And meanwhile, if you provide easy credit conditions,
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.180]   you may very well create deflation
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.260]   because you may allow marginal companies
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.620]   to stay in business,
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.100]   companies that should go out of business,
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.620]   but for the fact that they can refinance their debts
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.180]   very cheaply as a result of ultra easy monetary policies.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.940]   I don't know what to do with the disease concept
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.420]   you just introduced,
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.220]   'cause it's not clear how this is all gonna play out.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.020]   It certainly looks as though the pandemic
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.380]   has had some impact
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.660]   on contributing to the supply chain disruptions
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.260]   to the extent that port workers
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.660]   have been ill and couldn't work,
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.460]   and that certainly could be contributing to inflation
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.220]   rather than disinflation.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.340]   So, a lot of things changed, possibly fundamentally,
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.260]   possibly for a while,
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.020]   as a result of the pandemic.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.220]   And right now, I think we clearly have an inflation problem,
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.700]   but looking beyond that,
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.900]   I think technological innovation
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.580]   is gonna be a source of disruption
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.500]   and is going to lead to more productivity
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.220]   offsetting these inflationary forces.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.100]   - You touched on interest rates earlier,
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.660]   and interest rates now are persistently low
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.340]   given the high inflation rate.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.860]   You were predicting, if I recall,
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.540]   that the 10-year Treasury should go over 2%,
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.500]   probably even getting close to three,
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.820]   if I'm not mistaken, by maybe next year.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.580]   But it hasn't.
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:17.340]   I mean, it's been persistently stuck here, it seems.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.300]   Can you comment on, number one, what's going on?
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.140]   And number two,
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.340]   you still have that prediction for next year?
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.980]   - No, I mean, I scaled it back.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.780]   It just didn't work out.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.820]   And so, I scaled it back to,
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.620]   well, maybe we'll get to two.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.740]   I thought we'd get to 2% by the middle of this year.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.780]   And we were going in the right direction there
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.020]   when we got to 1.7% in March.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.980]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.220]   it started coming back down again for no obvious reason.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.460]   Maybe the bond market had more concerns
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.780]   about the underlying pandemic
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.300]   as being fundamentally deflationary.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.740]   And then bond markets really have been globalized.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.220]   So now we've got bond yields at zero
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.540]   or slightly negative in Germany and Japan.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:06.700]   So maybe they just keep buying our bonds at 1.5%,
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.780]   which is why we haven't gone to 2%.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.100]   But of course, the Fed also has been buying bonds like mad.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.540]   And I think, well, but here they've announced
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.060]   and they've started to taper,
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.220]   and yet we still don't see a 2% handle.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.620]   I think we will sometime next year,
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.620]   but I don't know that we're gonna see 3%.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:30.820]   I think the Fed is gonna be even more liberal next year
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.500]   than they were since the pandemic started,
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.220]   continuing to be more concerned
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.660]   about the labor market than inflation.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.780]   And so I think there will be a couple of rate increases
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.260]   next year, two, not three.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.340]   And then I think the Fed will actually move the goalpost
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.060]   and say that their inflation target is 3% instead of 2%.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.020]   - Interesting.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.220]   The Fed has been buying a lot
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.540]   of treasury inflation-protected securities as well.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.300]   I think they own 20% of the market now.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.780]   - Yes, they do.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.060]   - Why are they doing that?
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.420]   - I don't see any point in it whatsoever.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.220]   I mean, the less that they meddle
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.700]   in capital markets, the better.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.660]   So what are they doing in the TIPS market?
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.220]   The TIPS market could actually give us some guidance
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.340]   on what inflationary expectations are doing,
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.300]   but you can't come to that conclusion
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.220]   when the Fed's such a heavy player in that marketplace.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.300]   It's a mystery.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.940]   I mean, other than them believing
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.940]   that if they're gonna buy bonds,
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.380]   they should buy them across the maturity spectrum
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.580]   and as well as in some of the esoteric bonds like the TIPS,
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.660]   but it makes no sense.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.340]   There's no reason for it.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.540]   - Let's go overseas for a bit
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.340]   and tell me what you see in Europe
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.180]   and then go across the Pacific
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.980]   and tell me what you see in China.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.940]   - Well, Europe has a demographic problem.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.940]   Their populations are aging.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.860]   Their populations aren't growing very rapidly.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.540]   They're trying to have policies
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.660]   that are consistent with a nationalistic policies
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.340]   covering all the region of Europe,
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.660]   or at least the Eurozone,
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.500]   and yet they still have a lot of nationalities.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.460]   I mean, they still have nation states there
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.580]   that don't necessarily all agree
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.580]   on what policies should actually be.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.060]   And so there's a lot of inconsistencies,
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.980]   a lot of tensions in the way that system is designed.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.340]   They've got a monetary union,
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.620]   but they don't have a tax union.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.500]   They don't really have a fiscal union.
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.420]   It's only as a result of the pandemic
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.620]   that they started issuing Euro bonds for the region.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.340]   I think Europe got some major issues
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.260]   in terms of stimulating their economy.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:41.180]   And I don't view it as a particularly vibrant
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.780]   or dynamic economy.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.660]   They don't have the same kind of mix of histories
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.180]   that we have here.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.540]   We certainly have a lot more in healthcare
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.700]   and a lot more in technology and finance
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.140]   than they do.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.220]   There's venture capital here.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.340]   There's a lot of wealthy people
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.660]   that reinvest their monies in new innovations.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.780]   It seems to me as though we're more innovative
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.140]   than the Europeans are.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.060]   So by comparison to the U.S.,
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.820]   I think there's a lot of room for improvement
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.380]   in the way things operate in Europe.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.140]   With regards to China,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.700]   China's got a very, very serious fundamental problem
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.020]   also with their demography,
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.260]   and they worsened it with the one child policy.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.740]   When we look around the world,
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.780]   fertility rates have collapsed below replacement
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.380]   just about everywhere except India and Africa.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:36.580]   And they'll probably go to below replacement there too,
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.380]   because I think it's all related to urbanization.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.260]   In agricultural communities, kids have an economic value.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.860]   In an urban setting, kids are all cost.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.940]   And where are you gonna put them?
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.380]   I mean, people live in apartments.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.900]   They live in small houses maybe.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.940]   And so we've seen fertility rates collapse,
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.860]   and that's particularly occurred,
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:55.820]   it's occurred around the world.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.100]   It's occurred in China.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.660]   And the Chinese made that much worse
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.340]   with the one child policy,
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.980]   which was only lifted in 2015.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.740]   And now only this year they said,
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.620]   "Okay, you can have not just two children,
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.100]   "but you can have three children."
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.420]   But it's too late.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.580]   Demographic damage has been done.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.900]   And we can see that in inflation-adjusted retail sales,
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.700]   real retail sales growth, which I monitor every month,
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.700]   has plunged from about 18% in 2011 to zero recently.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:28.940]   So the demography is really haunting them
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.580]   in terms of consumer demand.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.500]   And then of course, their whole property bubble
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.140]   seems to be ready to burst.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.340]   And if it's not gonna burst,
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.180]   they're gonna try to manage to take the air out of it,
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.220]   which is gonna take a lot of growth out of their economy.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:47.140]   So they're becoming more and more dependent on exports,
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.580]   which is becoming less and less reliable,
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.820]   at least exports to countries
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.500]   that they're having political tensions with,
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.940]   like the United States, like Australia,
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.260]   and maybe some others.
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.860]   So I think China's operating
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.740]   from a fundamentally weak demographic position.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:08.060]   And I worry about what that might imply
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.500]   in terms of their military aggressiveness.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.420]   - Wag the dog, right?
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.500]   Create a diversion.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.540]   - Yeah.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.180]   - Let's get into back to the United States
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.620]   and let's talk about an area that you discussed
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.380]   on one of your podcasts recently,
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.020]   where you're going to begin to focus
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.460]   this whole idea of productivity.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.100]   And where do you see us becoming more productive?
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:27.700]   And you're gonna start to focus a lot on that
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.300]   with your research.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.020]   - Well, the productivity story, I think, is a huge story.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.700]   I think it's the story that will make
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.660]   or break the decade ahead here.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.900]   If this is the 1970s all over again,
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.900]   then productivity will be collapsing
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.980]   during the current decade.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.940]   But that's not what I see.
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.980]   I see productivity having bottomed around 0.5%
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.980]   at an annual rate during 2015,
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.100]   now running around 2%,
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.700]   which is a significant improvement.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.300]   And I think it's gonna go to 4% within the next few years.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.460]   And I think the technology revolution
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.020]   that started in the 1990s is ongoing.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.940]   I think the technologies have become more powerful,
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.620]   more user-friendly, cheaper, easier to implement,
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.900]   and really lend themselves to being used
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.620]   in just about every business.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.780]   I tell people, when you look at your stock portfolio,
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.100]   ask yourself if every one of your stocks
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.380]   is a technology stock.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.980]   And they look at me and say, "You're kidding.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:31.180]   "You don't want me to put 100% of my portfolio in tech."
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.260]   I said, "No, what I mean by that
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.100]   "is you wanna own tech for sure,
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.700]   "but you wanna make sure that the companies
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.780]   "that you own that are not in tech
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.980]   "are using tech to increase
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.940]   "their productivity and efficiency."
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.340]   So for example, these days,
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.780]   people talk about fintech and medtech
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:49.580]   as being sub-industries within those sectors.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.100]   And that's the way I'm looking at things.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.500]   The big story really for productivity
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.060]   is the big story in the demography.
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.180]   We've got very little growth in the labor force,
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.980]   very little growth in the population.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.540]   And that's really the key to understanding
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.100]   why productivity is bound to make a comeback.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:12.300]   Companies, I think, started to realize before the pandemic
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.220]   that there was something wrong in the labor market.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.980]   There's not enough workers.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.700]   And the unemployment rate got down to 3.5%
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.860]   before the pandemic.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.940]   And so there's a real shortage of workers.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.140]   Pandemic hits, then everything is wild for a while.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.500]   And now people have come up with all sorts of explanations
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.900]   of why people haven't been coming back to the labor market.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.780]   But the reality is the underlying demography
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   of senior baby boomers retiring
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.940]   and not being replaced by many more younger people,
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.900]   but barely by being replaced by younger people,
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.700]   we're seeing that the labor force growth is about 0.5%.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.900]   And the arithmetic of real GDP is very simple.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.060]   It's labor force growth plus productivity growth.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.300]   So if there's no growth in the labor force,
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.660]   there's no growth in real GDP,
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.740]   unless there's productivity growth.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.340]   And I think companies are already scrambling
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.020]   to use technology to increase their productivity.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.820]   And 4% productivity growth would be marvelous.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.860]   It would be a very bullish scenario.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.020]   - I want one last question.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.420]   It has to do with energy.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.020]   You've made comments recently
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   about the potential future rise again of nuclear power
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.340]   and also cold fusion.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.580]   I just want to touch on those.
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.180]   And what would they mean?
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.540]   - Well, I'm an economist.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.700]   I've trained as an economist.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.700]   And my main complaint about economists
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.420]   and the way economists are educated
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.580]   is if you go back and look
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.900]   at your introductory Economics 101 textbook
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.620]   written by Paul Samuelson,
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.980]   you'll see that economics is described
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:48.820]   as the science of optimally allocating scarce resources.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.420]   It's a pretty depressing concept
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.620]   that there's only so many resources out there
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.860]   and it's up to economists to come up with systems
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.820]   that optimally allocate those resources.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.460]   And I can fundamentally disagree
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.180]   with that definition of economics.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.660]   I think economics is about technology being used
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.180]   to overcome what appears to be scarce resources.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.980]   The way we know things are scarce
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.700]   is through the price mechanism.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.300]   When prices go up for something,
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.420]   well, there's some scarcity there.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.620]   And then some entrepreneur says,
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.700]   "I know, I got an idea for how I could overcome that
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.420]   "and come up with something better, smarter, cheaper
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.380]   "to deal with that scarcity."
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.700]   And it's technological innovations
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.740]   that really make the difference.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:36.500]   And I think that's gonna be a big surprise
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.300]   with regards to all these concerns about climate change
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.660]   and about fossil fuels and so on.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.980]   I'm just been fascinated recently,
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.380]   there seems to be a breakout of new technologies
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.820]   that may very well allow for the commercialization,
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.500]   not of nuclear fission power,
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.380]   but nuclear fusion or cold fusion power.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:01.020]   And if that's the case, that would be truly miraculous
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.740]   because fusion generates energy without any emissions.
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.780]   It's clean, it's very, very cheap.
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.300]   And that may be my next book
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:14.340]   is trying to map out how something like that
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.940]   would impact the course of our economy
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.660]   and the financial markets.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:19.740]   - And the world.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.980]   - Absolutely, absolutely, be a game changer.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.220]   - Well, Ed, thank you so much again
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.660]   for being our guest on Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.700]   I really enjoyed the talk today.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.540]   - Thank you.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.700]   - I really enjoy reading your information.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:35.540]   I know your work is for mainly institutional investors,
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.980]   but if an individual investor wanted to follow you,
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.020]   how would they do that?
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.060]   - Well, yeah, the reason it's for institutional investors
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.180]   is because we spend a lot of time and money
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.500]   given our very best efforts.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.580]   And it's the market that is especially attuned
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.420]   to what we do.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.020]   But individual investors are welcome
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.940]   to at least try it for four weeks.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.460]   Go to yardeni.com, Y-A-R-D-E-N-I.com.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.980]   And at the top of the website there,
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.460]   there's a form to fill out a trial.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:06.140]   Other than that, I do post quite often,
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.460]   almost daily actually, on LinkedIn.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.420]   And then that's shown on Twitter as well.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.660]   So I do provide quite a bit of insights that way.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.300]   I kind of view myself as having a day job,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.380]   which is how I feed the family,
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.580]   and then having an evening job writing these books
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:27.660]   and providing some information on LinkedIn
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.740]   to the general public,
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.140]   because I have learned a lot over the years,
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.140]   and I'd like to share it with people
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.860]   and get their opinions,
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.300]   and maybe tweak some of my own thoughts
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.620]   at this point in my life.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.140]   I got plans for more books.
