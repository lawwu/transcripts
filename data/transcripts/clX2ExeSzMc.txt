[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   Well, the Apostle Paul says that Christ died for all people, even the non-elect.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.820]   And of course, that raises some very delicate questions for us Calvinists to answer.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.780]   So how does Christ's atoning sacrifice apply to the non-elect?
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.120]   Question is from an anonymous listener to the podcast who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.120]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.800]   Many times I have heard people say, 'Yes, Christ died for all people, but not all people
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.600]   in the same way.'"
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   I know Reformed theology teaches that Christ's atonement is particular in that the extent
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.080]   of the atonement to save souls is limited to the elect only.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.040]   However, I am having trouble adequately explaining how Christ died for all people, but not all
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.280]   people in the same way.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.640]   For what tangible reason did Christ die for the non-elect?
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.720]   Let's start with 1 Timothy 4.10, which captures the "both/and."
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.600]   Goes like this, "For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hopes set on the
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:19.280]   living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe."
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   Savior of all, especially of those who believe.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.280]   Or as Paul says in Titus 2.11, "The grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280]   all people."
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.080]   And he would add, "Especially, especially those who believe."
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.640]   He brought salvation for all, especially for those who believe.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.560]   Or we can see the "both/and" in the Gospel of John.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.720]   Start with John 3.16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.600]   John 3.16.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.800]   So Christ came as an expression of God's love for the world.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:13.200]   Verse 17, "God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.320]   might be saved through him."
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.800]   So the offering of his Son is the offering of salvation to the world.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.960]   Now we'll come back to this in just a moment to answer the question, "For what tangible
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.240]   reason did Christ die for the non-elect?"
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.900]   But first, we need to see the other side of the coin in the Gospel of John besides saving
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.840]   the whole world.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.020]   I am the Good Shepherd.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.880]   This is chapter 10, verse 14.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.280]   I am the Good Shepherd.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   I know my own, and my own know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.640]   I lay down my life for the sheep.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.600]   I lay down my life for the sheep, the ones who know me, the ones that the Father's given
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   me.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.620]   And I have other sheep that are not of this fold.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.120]   Those are the elect scattered throughout the world.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.560]   I must bring them also.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.120]   They will listen to my voice.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.520]   That's what marks them out as sheep.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.640]   I go out, I preach, I call, and the sheep, the ones whom the Father has, who gives to
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.600]   me, they recognize my voice, they come to me, so there will be one flock and one shepherd.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.880]   So the Father has the sheep, he gives the sheep to Jesus, they are his own, they know
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.960]   his voice, he calls them, they come, he lays down his life for them, uniquely for them.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:41.360]   Paul says the same thing in Ephesians 5.25, "Christ loved the church and gave himself
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.480]   up for her."
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.840]   A husband loves his wife uniquely and in a special way, and that's the way Christ loves
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.720]   the church and dies for the church in a unique way.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.920]   Now, what's the effect of this focused, particular redemption for the bride, the sheep, the elect?
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.280]   What does the death do that's unique for the bride?
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.840]   I think Romans 8.32 gives the answer.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.080]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all."
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.200]   Now, pause.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.400]   "Us all," in the context of Romans 8.32, is clearly the elect.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.300]   It's not the whole world, it's the elect.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.040]   He did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.520]   You can see it in the next verse.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.880]   Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.000]   It is God who justifies.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Who is to condemn?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.320]   And that's how verse 32 is being fulfilled.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.080]   And you can see it in the rest of this verse.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.480]   So let me start over and read the rest of the verse.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.960]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.560]   him graciously give us all things?"
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:10.920]   In other words, the death of Christ for his people secures and guarantees for them every
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.840]   saving blessing that there is.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.040]   Will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.760]   Yes, he will, because that is what the death of Christ guarantees for all the elect.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   If God gave his son in this same way for every person on the planet, then that promise would
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.240]   attach to every person, because it's attached to the blood of Jesus, to the sacrifice of
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.240]   Jesus, and that means every person would be saved, would be guaranteed every possible
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.320]   blessing, which Paul says clearly is not the case.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.240]   Second Thessalonians 1.9.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:03.640]   So what can we say about how the death of Christ expresses itself for the elect and
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.080]   the non-elect who reject him?
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.280]   How is it different?
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.880]   For the elect, the blood of Jesus is the blood of the new covenant, which purchases for them
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   a new heart, new life, faith, and obedience.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.800]   Jesus says that in Luke 22.20, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood."
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.160]   So the blood of Jesus is purchasing the new covenant, and the new covenant is not an offer
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.060]   of salvation, it's an accomplishment of salvation in the hearts of God's people.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.040]   He gives them a new heart and a new spirit, a gift of life, gift of faith, gift of obedience.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.920]   Now back to John 3.16 for the other side of how the death of Christ relates to the world
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   or to the non-elect.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:03.560]   I think the wording of John 3.16 provides the answer how to speak of the gift of Christ,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.320]   the death of Christ, for the non-elect, the whole world.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:18.440]   Here's how he puts it, "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son so that whoever
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.880]   believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:31.720]   He loved the world so that everyone who believes would have life.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:39.300]   So the way to speak about the giving of the Son as an expression of love to the world
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.860]   is to highlight the word "so that."
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.760]   So that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:56.120]   That's the connection we make between the death of Christ and every person on this planet.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:04.520]   Christ accomplished a completely full and satisfactory and effective redemption for
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.260]   whosoever believes.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:14.260]   You may look everyone in the eye, absolutely everyone in your neighborhood, at your church,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.260]   at your work.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:21.040]   You can look everyone in the eye, and you should look everyone in the eye and say, "Believe
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.320]   on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will never perish.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.480]   Believe on him.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.980]   You will become a full and complete participant in the perfect salvation, the perfect payment
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:43.320]   for sins, the perfect propitiation of the wrath of God, the perfect obedience for imputation,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.800]   the perfect deliverance from death and hell and Satan and into the everlasting glory of
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   God.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.160]   All of that is yours.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.240]   It's yours for the believing because of Jesus' death."
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.680]   We could never talk like that to people.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.000]   We don't know who the non-elect are, so let's just assume there's lots of them that are
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   listening.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.440]   We could never talk like that to the non-elect if Jesus hadn't died the way he did.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:22.240]   That is a great and awesome gift that we are indebted to give to the entire world.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:30.640]   Oh, that God would put fire in our hearts to take that message to the ends of the earth.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.640]   Amen.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:38.400]   What a glorious gospel meant for the free proclamation to all people in our families,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.240]   neighborhoods, communities, all the peoples around the globe.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.000]   Pastor John, thank you for this reminder.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.080]   Thanks for listening and for supporting this podcast.

[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.020]   us an email of your own, even questions related to Reformed theology and Calvinism and how
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.720]   the implications of it all shake out.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:05.680]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.960]   Well a tablecloth full of animals descended from heaven before the eyes of Peter and from
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.120]   that moment no animal is now unclean.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.440]   And since that precious incident in Redemptive History, the kitchen doors have flung wide
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:28.400]   open to all kinds of delicious dishes like lobster and coconut shrimp and bluefin tuna
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.680]   sushi and bacon wrapped everything and juicy porterhouse steaks and bacon wrapped juicy
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.240]   porterhouse steaks and on and on and on it goes.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:45.400]   But there's still a lingering question over whether veganism more closely maps on to God's
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.600]   original dietary design.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   Hmm.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.680]   It's a good question and it's the question on Friday.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.200]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.920]   We'll see you Friday to talk food.
