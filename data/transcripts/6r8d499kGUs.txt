[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Pastor John, this question comes on the heels
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.240]   of a question we addressed in episode 122,
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.080]   which was one of the most popular episodes
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.680]   we've ever released.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.360]   Is my boyfriend's porn a marriage deal breaker?
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.080]   And now we have an email from a listener
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.240]   who wants to push this sin into marriage
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.160]   and ask the question,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.760]   is my husband's porn a marriage deal breaker?
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.240]   What would you say to this question, Pastor John?
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240]   - My answer is no.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.240]   Your husband's struggle or compromise with pornography
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.080]   is not a marriage deal breaker.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.520]   And I would say the same thing,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.740]   that a wife's compromise with pornography
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.280]   is not a husband's deal breaker.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.160]   That's not to be assumed in our day,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.380]   because it cuts both ways.
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.400]   I don't wanna be hard on the women here.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.020]   I want, what I really wanna say is,
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.920]   marriage is a covenant created in heaven,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.640]   sealed with a vow of lifelong commitment
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.600]   between a man and a woman,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.380]   consummated in sexual union.
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.720]   That's my definition.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.840]   I believe it's a biblical definition of what marriage is.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.680]   So my answer to the question of what can break the marriage
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.800]   is based on what marriage is.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.920]   So let me just work that out for a minute or two.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.480]   It's a covenant, it's covenantal.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.400]   The foundational text for marriage is Genesis 2:24.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.680]   A man shall leave his father and his mother
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.660]   and hold fast, cleave to his wife,
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.920]   and they shall become one flesh.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.760]   And when Paul picked that up in Ephesians 5,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.600]   he interpreted it, this is a profound mystery.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.160]   And I am saying it refers to Christ and the church,
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.520]   which means God created marriage
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.360]   to be a picture of the covenant commitment
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.680]   Christ has to his church and his church to him.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.240]   Therefore, marriage is fundamentally covenantal
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.040]   and covenantal to the max.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.560]   Namely, it is a model of how Christ is bonded
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   to his church in the new covenant relationships.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.120]   And he is really, really bonded to his church.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.040]   So the first thing I wanna say is we have a covenant
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.840]   and that's what marriage is.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   The second thing is it's created in heaven.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.440]   When we stand in front of a crowd of people
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040]   and we say, I do, or make our vows,
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.360]   we're not ultimately creating a marriage.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.760]   God is creating a marriage.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.800]   And I based that on Mark 10, nine.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.480]   What therefore God has joined together.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.040]   Let not man separate.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.240]   Those are amazing words.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.240]   In this moment of covenant making through vows,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.200]   God is doing something and we have no right
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   to undo it as mere people.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.480]   And the third thing I would say is it's lifelong.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.320]   It's till death.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.360]   Romans 7, a married woman is bound by law to her husband
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.320]   while he lives.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.040]   But if her husband dies,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.320]   she is released from the law of marriage.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   Accordingly, she'll be called an adulteress
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.480]   if she lives with another man,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.840]   or he'll be called an adulterer
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.880]   if he lives with another woman while her husband is alive.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.800]   This is for life.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.560]   Till death do us part.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.240]   You know, when I do marriages,
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.600]   I let people put a lot of things in vows that I don't write.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.480]   But one thing I insist is always there,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.400]   namely till death do us part,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.080]   or something exactly meaning the same thing.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.080]   And then it's, fourthly, it's consummated in sexual union.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.760]   The two should become one flesh, be fruitful and multiply.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.880]   Adam knew his wife, or 1 Corinthians 7,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.160]   to because of temptations to sexual immorality,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.280]   each man should have his own wife.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.800]   And each woman, her own husband.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.200]   The husband should give his wife her conjugal,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.840]   that means sexual rights,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.760]   and likewise the wife to her husband.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.360]   So the implications of that definition of marriage
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.240]   is stay together.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.160]   Stay together through hell and high water.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.960]   Jesus said, "Whatever God has joined together,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.920]   don't separate."
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.800]   Or Mark 10, 11, "Whoever divorces his wife
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.880]   and marries another commits adultery against her.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   And if she divorces her husband and marries another,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.360]   she commits adultery."
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.800]   And Paul, to the married, I say,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.400]   this is 1 Corinthians 7, 10,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.480]   "I give charge, not I, but the Lord.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.440]   The wife should not separate from her husband.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.080]   If she does, she should remain unmarried
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.720]   or else be reconciled to her husband.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.880]   And the husband should not divorce his wife."
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.440]   In other words, when we make vows,
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   and I hope this young woman made this vow,
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.520]   for better or for worse,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.200]   we don't mean for better or for worse,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.880]   unless there's pornography,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.960]   or for better or for worse,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.640]   unless you turn out to be somebody
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.280]   I never dreamed you were.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.320]   Which by the way, happens pretty much everybody.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.800]   Wives and husbands do not stay the same.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.520]   Marriage is risky business,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.360]   which is why I think the disciples said,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.280]   "Perhaps it's not wise to marry."
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.680]   And Jesus said, "Well, it's given to some and not to others."
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.960]   And Christians, it is given to.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.960]   It is our privilege and right to be committed in this way.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.320]   So, Tony, this husband is committing a grave sin
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.760]   against God and against his wife.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.240]   I don't mean to minimize it at all.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.760]   For reasons we've seen in podcasts gone by.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.080]   But marriage is greater.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.760]   It's greater than any sin.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.680]   It is a picture of Christ and the church.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   And in that stunning framework, you go to Christ,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.440]   you plead with him for the power and the grace
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.800]   and the wisdom to move towards repentance.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.840]   And in her case, I would say, if necessary,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.640]   involving the men of the church,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   going to the men in a small group,
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.120]   saying, "My husband won't listen to me.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.160]   "Help me."
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.040]   And the church steps in and helps a wife with this.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.240]   Marriage is not a trap,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.040]   but like a powerful promise from the Lord.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.280]   If he's ordained that his children
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.680]   stay in very hard marriages, which he does,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.320]   it's because he stays in a relationship
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.520]   to his sinful church.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.440]   And he means to do great things for us in those marriages
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   to display glorious aspects
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.840]   of his merciful covenant keeping in this world.
