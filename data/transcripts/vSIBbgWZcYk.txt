[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Hey, everyone, this is Tony with a little production note before we begin. You know,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.160]   just when you cannot imagine John Piper's voice diving any lower than it already is,
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.240]   here we are. It's bronchial stuff of some sort, and it's plunging Pastor John into new realms
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.800]   of sub-bass that only a Hollywood movie trailer voiceover guy could probably normally reach.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.120]   And that's true here for about the next week or so. Alas, here's today's episode.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.160]   Pastor John, here's a question from Caden in Boca Raton, Florida.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.640]   "Hello, Pastor John. After seeing the documentary American Gospel,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.640]   I was conflicted because I'm not sure if I'm supposed to call out false teachers.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.120]   2 Peter 2, verses 1 to 3 make it obvious that there will be false teachers,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920]   but the text also doesn't say we should point them out. I have heard both sides to this argument,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.560]   but I'm still not quite sure. I want to be careful not to pronounce judgment before the time."
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.160]   1 Corinthians 4, 5. Does this passage apply here in this situation? Are we taking a judgment that
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.480]   isn't ours to take, or should we rest in God's ultimate knowledge? And if a prominent false
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.480]   teacher is to be called out, who does this, where, and how? Maybe it would be helpful to
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.800]   step back first and get the bigger picture of the New Testament response to those who live
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:24.720]   and teach in ways that lead others into error and ruin, and then zero in on 1 Corinthians 4, 5
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.200]   and some guidelines for how we should speak and write about such people.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.000]   So let's begin with Jesus. Matthew 7, 15. "Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.920]   clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves." And the word "beware" means all of us should be alert,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.760]   but especially shepherds, to identify not just false teaching, but false teachers
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.800]   whose ways are subtle, like they're clothing themselves with lamb's wool while they're
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.160]   wolves. And Paul used the same Greek word for "beware" in Acts 20 when he said, "Pay careful
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.360]   attention to yourselves and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:24.720]   I know that after my departure, fierce wolves"—same as Jesus—"fierce wolves will come in among you,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.880]   not sparing the flock." Acts 20, 28. Jesus used the same word again in Matthew 16, 6,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.720]   but he got more specific. He said, "Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:51.920]   Sadducees." Paul had the same kind of group in mind, the same kind of error in mind in Philippians
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:01.040]   2—no, Philippians 3, verse 2 and verse 18. "Look out for the dogs." There it is. "Look out for the
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.200]   dogs. Look out for the evil workers. Look out for those who mutilate the flesh." And verse 18,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.080]   "For many of whom I have told you often and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.320]   cross of Christ." Then in Romans 16, 17, he warned, "Watch out for those who cause divisions
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.400]   and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught. Avoid them." To avoid them,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.120]   you have to know who they are, right? You can't avoid somebody if you don't know who they are.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.520]   - Right.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:49.680]   - This idea of identifying and avoiding shows up in 1 Corinthians 5, 11, 2 Thessalonians 3, 6,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.800]   verse 14, 2 Timothy 3, 4, 2 John 1, 10. In other words, Christians and shepherds in particular
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:09.360]   should be discerning and alert to behavior and teaching that dishonors Christ and destroys
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:21.040]   people and not treat it in a casual or harmless way. And then in 1 Timothy 5, 19, Paul went beyond
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:31.520]   "avoid them" to "rebuke them publicly." So speaking of elders who persist in error, he said, "Do not
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.920]   admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. As for those
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   who persist in sin," and I think that could be sin of false doctrine or sin of evil behavior,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.520]   "as for those who persist," they don't accept rebuke, "as for those in sin, rebuke them in
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.760]   the presence of all so that the rest may stand in fear." And then he went on and actually named
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.320]   destructive false teachers, "Demus, in love with the present world has deserted me," 2 Timothy 4,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.240]   10. "You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.320]   Phidulas and Hermogenes," 2 Timothy 1, 15. "By rejecting faith and a good conscience,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.120]   some have made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander," 1 Timothy 1, 19.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:42.800]   "Their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Philetus," 2 Timothy 2, 16. So Paul names at
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:53.920]   least six false teachers that the church should watch out for. So I infer from Jesus and Paul
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:04.320]   and Luke and John that false teaching and destructive behavior are present dangers in this
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:13.840]   fallen world for the church, and that all of us, especially shepherds, pastors, should be alert
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:24.320]   and discerning to identify and in appropriate ways expose, expose in order to protect the flock. We
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.040]   should expose them and minimize the spread of the gangrene, as Paul calls it. Now, in 1 Corinthians
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:38.240]   4, 5, Paul is talking about how the Corinthians should assess Paul and Cephas and Apollos,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:47.200]   because the people are choosing sides and boasting in their favorite teacher. He says, "For I am not
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.240]   aware of anything in myself, anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.160]   the Lord who judges me. Therefore don't pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.120]   who will bring to light the things that are now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:15.040]   of the heart. Then each one," Paul, Cephas, Apollos, "each one will receive his commendation from God."
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:24.960]   So Cain is asking, asking me, asking us, whether the words "do not pronounce judgment before the
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:33.760]   time" should keep us from identifying false teachers or from naming them. I don't think so.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:44.080]   "Don't pronounce judgment before the time" means don't do what only Christ can do at that last day,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:51.360]   before the time, that time of judgment, the day of judgment. Don't presume to know the heart like
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.320]   Jesus will know the heart on that day. Only Christ will "bring to light the things now hidden in
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:06.720]   darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart." But for now, our job is indeed to do
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:15.440]   mouth judgment, writing judgment, behavior judgment—not heart judgment, but mouth and
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.240]   writing and behavior judgment. When a mouth speaks unbiblical, destructive teaching, when a
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:30.560]   blog or an article or a book publishes unbiblical and destructive teaching, when a body, a human
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:39.440]   body, a physical body, behaves with unbiblical and destructive behavior, in all these cases,
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:46.480]   we are to be discerning and, according to Ephesians 5:11, expose the error. It says,
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them, censure them,
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   show them to be wrong," is what that "elenchos" word means. So, the question is, how and when,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   not if. And here, I think the Bible calls for wisdom rather than telling us who and when and
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   how. The question we ask is, how can we best, in our situation, with our gifts and our
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:35.520]   responsibilities, how can we best help most people believe and live the most truth, and how can we
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:42.960]   protect the most people from destructive beliefs and behaviors? And here are some factors, perhaps,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   to consider when deciding whether to name a false teacher. The urgency of your naming a false
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.360]   teacher increases. So, we've got, what, five factors that would cause the urgency to name
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:05.760]   would increase if, one, the seriousness and deceitfulness of the error is great; two,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:13.440]   the size of the audience gets bigger; three, the duration of their ministry—do they make one
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.240]   blunder, or are they constantly doing it?—four, the vulnerability of the people for whom you are
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:29.440]   responsible; five, the role you have in influencing shepherds who really need to be discerning for
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   who the false teachers are. And when you do name a false teacher, best to do it in a setting where
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.520]   you do more than name-drop. You explain the error, you give reasons for rejecting it, you communicate
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:52.960]   complexities, you set a tone of longing for truth and love, you know, just slinging mud.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:11:01.760]   The last thing I would say is, let your teaching be so powerful in clarifying the greatness and
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:09.680]   the beauty and the worth of God's truth that your people will smell error before it infects their
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:18.800]   lives. The shape of error is always changing. You can't preach enough negative sermons to stay ahead
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:27.840]   of it, and you don't have to. The best protection against the darkness of error is the light of
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.680]   truth. Really good. Thank you, Pastor John. And thanks for subscribing to the Ask Pastor John
