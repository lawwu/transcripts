[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Well, each of us needs to change something about ourselves and many of us want to change
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.520]   something about ourselves.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.180]   So how do we break free from the patterns and ruts of life?
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.000]   What hope is there for personal change in our lives when we seem to be stuck?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.120]   The answer comes in a marriage sermon on a glorious text in Ephesians 5 verses 22 to
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.120]   33.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.520]   In a 2007 sermon, here's what John Piper said.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.500]   Marriage in its deepest meaning is a copy of Christ and His church.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.600]   If you want to understand God's meaning for marriage, you have to grasp that we're dealing
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.640]   with a copy.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.440]   Marriage isn't an end in itself.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.380]   This is why marriage doesn't exist in the resurrection.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.320]   It's a copy.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.860]   Copies aren't needed anymore.
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.840]   And the reality is fullest on its display.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   Here they're needed.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.400]   The world is filled with a need for this very kind of marriage.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.800]   It won't be needed in the end.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.120]   It's a copy.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.380]   And what it's copying is an original, a reality, a truth.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.900]   So it's a copy of a greater original.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.280]   It's a metaphor of a greater reality.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.800]   It's a parable of a greater truth.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.740]   And the original, the reality, and the truth is God's marriage to His people or Christ's
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.580]   marriage to His church.
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.780]   And the copy, the metaphor, and the parable is human marriage.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.600]   Jeffrey Bromley, one of my teachers in church history of all things, wrote a book called
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.740]   God and Marriage.
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.880]   And he said this, "As God made man in His own image, so He made earthly marriage in
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.840]   the image of His own eternal marriage with His people."
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.680]   Pause here.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.560]   Men, I said a minute ago, if you really got this text, if it landed on you, you wouldn't
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.320]   need next Sunday's message, the application one, because I really believe that even though
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.520]   application is appropriate and nitty-gritty examples are helpful and good and right for
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.720]   preachers to give, I don't think that's the main way preaching works.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.200]   I don't think that's the main way the Bible works.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.920]   I think the main way the Bible works and preaching that is faithful to the Bible works is that
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.320]   the Bible displays glories that we are designed and made to know and which we don't know because
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.160]   we're in the cesspool of soap operas.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.340]   And by the Holy Spirit, in a moment of illumination, all of that can be just driven out and something
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:07.460]   absolutely glorious enter into a human heart and change everything by virtue of its magnitude
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.580]   before any application ever arrives.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.740]   You're just changed.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.220]   Your heart soars with a new sense of what you're on the planet for and what this woman
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.940]   in her magisterial dignity as your bride is about and what you're living for here and
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:36.260]   everything changes when something lands on you with a biblical force.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.060]   That's what I would like to happen.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.100]   I can't make that happen.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.820]   Lift my voice, I'd like to lift my voice, but I can't make that happen.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.580]   God can.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.900]   So that's a little parenthesis to tell you how I think about preaching.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.180]   I will give you application.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.780]   But I have a little misgiving when somebody hears a sermon like this and their first response
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.540]   is "You ever give me an example?"
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.340]   All right, I'll give you an example, but is your heart exploding with the glory of marriage?
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.260]   Are you soaring?
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.460]   Will you by the end of this service just begin to take off like a little roadrunner?
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.340]   So that from those new heights, she looks different, the kids look different, the job
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.620]   looks different, the planet looks different, life looks different, death looks different,
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.020]   the devil looks different.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.140]   Let me out of here, I want to live.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.460]   Wonder changes people, not examples.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:48.100]   Lists and examples, a little bit helpful.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.420]   But seeing glory changes everything.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.780]   Glorious, I love that.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.380]   This sermon clip was from John Piper's sermon on marriage titled Lionhearted and Lamblike,
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.540]   the Christian Husband as Head, part one from back in 2007.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.940]   You can find the full message on our site, DesiringGod.org.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.460]   And this clip was suggested by podcast listener Doug Moore from Goshen, Indiana.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.460]   Thank you, Doug, for this gem.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.300]   If you have a favorite selection from a John Piper sermon, send us the name of the sermon
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.880]   and the timestamps of when and where the clip appears in the audio, and we will share it
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.580]   online here in the podcast.

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.620]   Well change is part of our lives and breakups too are part of our lives, a particularly
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.520]   painful part of life.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.800]   But there is biblical hope for the breakups we experience as John Piper will explain to
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.820]   us tomorrow as he returns to answer the question from a podcast listener.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.500]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.140]   I'll see you tomorrow.
