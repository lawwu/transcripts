[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   "When we pray, where do our prayers go to?" This was a question answered by John
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.180]   Piper in his 2006 sermon titled "Prayer and the Victory of God." Here's what he
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.740]   said. Final text on this to illustrate the connection between prayer and the
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.820]   victory of God is Revelation 8, 4 and 5. This is amazing. I love this image. Try to
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.580]   get it. An angel, another angel came and stood at the altar. So now picture God.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.700]   No, you can't picture God, but here it is. An altar and God and a throne. Another
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.460]   angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer and he was given much
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:58.060]   incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints. Get this. Millions of saints.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.620]   This is a picture of heaven at the end. At the end, not back then, the end. So
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:13.700]   millions and billions and billions of prayers stored in heaven, never forgotten,
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.300]   not one "Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come" will ever be forgotten. With all the
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.020]   prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne and the smoke of
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.980]   the incense of the prayers, the incense of the prayers of the saints rose before
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.700]   God from the hand of the angel. Now we usually stop there and we think, "Oh yeah,
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.660]   I've heard that the prayers of the saints are like incense and they smell
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.160]   really good to God and that's true and that's magnificent." You want to make God
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.940]   happy? Pray. You want to create a good smell in the kitchen of heaven? Pray. But
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.260]   this text isn't going there. It's going to victory. Verse 5, "The angel took the
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.100]   censer and filled it with fire from the altar where these millions of prayers
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.780]   are burning. Filled it and threw it on the earth with peals of thunder and
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.860]   rumblings and flashes of lightning and an earthquake." You wonder, "Where did all
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.580]   these signs come from at the end?" They came from your prayers. "Hallowed be thy
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.300]   name on the earth, O God. Let your kingdom come, O God. Let it come. Bring it in, O
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.620]   God. Let your will be done on this planet the way the angels do it in heaven. Hasten
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.140]   the day of our God." That's what gets thrown on the earth in fire. The victory
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:01.180]   of God is coming and it's coming by the prayers of God's people. Amen. This clip
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.300]   was taken from John Piper's 2006 sermon titled "Prayer and the Victory of God," and
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.420]   he was talking about Revelation chapter 8 verses 4 and 5. This clip was suggested
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.460]   to us by podcast listener Justin Bushnell from Indianapolis, Indiana. Thank
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.340]   you, Justin, for suggesting this to us. And we now have 18 episodes on prayer in
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.260]   the APJ Archive. You can find them. Go to the landing page at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.860]   and type out the word "prayer" into the search bar and you
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.580]   will find all of those 18 episodes listed out right before your eyes. Well,
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.520]   a question has come in about whether souls can be scared into heaven. In other
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.740]   words, what is the right and what is the wrong emotional dynamics that can happen
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.800]   in personal conversion? John Piper is going to sit down with us tomorrow and
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.940]   sort of untangle the entailments of this question. I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.260]   for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast. We'll see you tomorrow.
