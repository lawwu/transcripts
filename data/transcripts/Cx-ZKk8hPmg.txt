[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   So what is an example of a luxury belief?
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.600]   Well, in 2020, the defund the police movement gained a lot of momentum.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.000]   And in early 2021, YouGov ran a survey and found that overall,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.120]   Americans were very much against defunding the police.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.600]   But when they broke down the results by income category,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.080]   they found that the highest income Americans were by far
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   the most supportive of defunding the police.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.880]   There was another survey of just Democratic voters and found that
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.280]   white Democrats were far more supportive of defunding the police
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.800]   than black and Hispanic Democrats.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.760]   And so as a result, despite the fact that most people didn't want this,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.000]   many cities across the US subsequently reduced spending for police departments.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.560]   And this has contributed to the violent crime wave
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.080]   that we've seen over the last couple of years.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.600]   So in the US, relative to those earning $75,000 or more per year,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.560]   the poorest Americans are seven times more likely to be victims of robbery,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.720]   seven times more likely to be victims of aggravated assault,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.440]   and 20 times more likely to be victims of sexual assault.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.920]   It's important here to understand that to not stop crime
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.840]   is to actually victimize the poor.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.960]   This is a luxury belief.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.020]   you
