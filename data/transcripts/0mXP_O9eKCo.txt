[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the great message which is to be
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.080]   found in the Gospel according to St. Matthew in the 24th chapter.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.960]   I come back for the third time to a consideration of this most important chapter, and we are
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.960]   looking in particular at the first of fourteen verses.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.840]   If you like, in particular this evening, verse six, "And ye shall hear of wars, and rumors
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.680]   of wars.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.760]   See that ye be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.760]   yet."
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:55.360]   Now, in this chapter, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is looking forward and giving
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.840]   his prophecy and his teaching concerning two main matters.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.440]   The first is the destruction of the temple in the city of Jerusalem, and indeed the destruction
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.720]   of the city of Jerusalem herself.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.960]   And the second great matter is the end of the world.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.600]   I needn't keep you this evening in reminding you again of the circumstances in which our
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.680]   Lord came to give this particular address, but we must bear this in mind, that it was
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.000]   just at the end of his life, just before the cross.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.040]   He knew what was coming; he was going to it steadfastly.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.200]   And he had been in the temple with his followers, and he walks out of the temple.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.280]   But before he does so, he makes his prophecy concerning the destruction of the temple and
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.760]   the destruction of the whole city of Jerusalem.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.440]   Then he walks out of the temple, and his disciples, having heard this and being surprised at it,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.600]   call his attention to the buildings of the temple, their apparent solidity, their apparent
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.460]   everlasting character, as if to say, "Is this possible?"
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.320]   And so our Lord begins to speak, and says to them, "There shall not be left here one
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.900]   stone upon another that shall not be thrown down."
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.000]   And then the disciples later begin to put their questions, saying thus, "Tell us, when
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.300]   shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?"
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.120]   And our Lord proceeds to deal with those various questions.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.160]   That is the essential content of this great chapter, the end of Jerusalem, the end of
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   the world.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   Now, I am calling attention to all this, I say, because it seems to me to be such an
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   urgent matter at a time like this.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.720]   Even scientists are talking today about the end of the world, at least the possible end
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.560]   of the world.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.420]   Philosophers and others are doing the same thing.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.680]   This whole question, because of these new scientific discoveries and because of these
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.580]   horrible and terrible bombs, this whole question is being raised in perhaps a more acute form
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.600]   than ever before in the whole history of mankind, as to whether the end of civilization and
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.320]   of the world may be something that is indeed at hand.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.900]   Never in a sense has life been more uncertain, more insecure, than now.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.920]   Never has there been such confusion.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.140]   And people are asking, and rightly asking questions, they say, "What's it all mean?
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.180]   What is it all about?
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.220]   What is it that's gone wrong with the human race?"
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.340]   At least, I say, every thoughtful person must of necessity be asking such questions, for
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.040]   there must be something radically wrong, that mankind can be so foolish as to commit suicide,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.860]   as it were, and to do things which may well lead to that.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:18.100]   Well, now then, because of all this, I say, people are asking these particular questions.
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.820]   And here, in this chapter, we have our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ dealing with these
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.060]   very matters.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.740]   But, the vast masses of the people, it's obvious to everybody, are not concerned to listen
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.740]   to him.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.780]   They're not interested in what he's got to say.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.220]   They feel it's quite irrelevant, that that's an old message which people once believed,
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.500]   but which is outmoded.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.220]   And as I was saying last Sunday night, they feel in particular that they've got one very
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.180]   good reason for not listening to it at all.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.460]   And that is that they feel that it has already failed.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.340]   Now we began dealing with that very subject last Sunday evening.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.060]   I come back to it tonight because it seems to me to be nothing less than tragic that
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.260]   there are masses of people in the world at this very moment who seem to be going headlong
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.540]   to destruction and to a horrible eternity for one reason only.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:32.660]   And that is that they've misunderstood the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.220]   And if I can do anything, by any simple word of mine, to enlighten any such who may be
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.760]   in this congregation, well, I shall consider the time well spent.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.380]   I know of nothing that is so disturbing to me as that with a gospel such as this available
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.500]   and facing us, that men and women won't even look at it, they won't even consider it, because
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.140]   they've had such a complete misrepresentation of it, that they feel, as I say, that it's
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.940]   already failed.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.740]   Therefore, one of the most urgent tasks confronting us is to get rid of this false notion of the
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.120]   gospel.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.540]   You have but to read the newspapers, you have but to listen to the various organs of propaganda
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:29.580]   and of publicity, to realize that in this country at the present time, it is this false
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.860]   view of the gospel that is being given the greatest amount of attention.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:43.020]   Now, don't misunderstand me; I'm not concerned about getting any publicity for the evangelical
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.380]   view of the gospel as such.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.620]   But it's obvious to the merest tyrant in these matters that you've only got to express strong
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.700]   opinions about this atomic bomb and so on, and you'll get the publicity.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.860]   And that is, therefore, the idea of the general public as to what Christianity is.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.020]   Their notion of Christianity is something like this, that it's just one of a number
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:13.380]   of great moral teachings, and that its primary purpose is to deal with the problems of the
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.500]   world and to improve the world.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.340]   That's their idea, that Christianity is a teaching which is meant to right the wrongs
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.940]   and lessen suffering, especially to banish war, to give us peace and enjoyment, and allow
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.300]   mankind to go on living almost endlessly and improving and gradually developing towards
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   perfection.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.420]   Now, that, I think you'll agree, is the common view which is held with respect to this matter.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.940]   Jesus Christ, what was he?
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:48.100]   Well, he was a kind of political teacher, a social teacher.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.340]   And he was especially concerned, they feel, about this question of war, because his great
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.220]   theme was love.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.540]   And he ended his life by dying upon a cross.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.540]   What was that?
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.980]   Well, they say, there he was just putting into practice his own teaching.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.900]   You see, the teaching is you mustn't hit back.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.020]   You turn the other cheek.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.020]   You never resist evil at all.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.980]   And furthermore, that by thus just doing nothing but allowing the enemy to kill you if necessary,
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.780]   you will have such a moral influence upon your enemy that he'll break down and he'll
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.060]   say, "I shouldn't have done that," and he'll never do it again.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.620]   Now, that is the teaching.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.940]   That is precisely what is believed.
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.660]   That this is nothing, I say, but moral teaching and exhortation.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:42.220]   That that is its program, to improve the world and especially to get rid of war.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.820]   And that the supreme example of this view of life and the way to live it is that which
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:54.220]   happened upon the cross when the Son of God, in an utter condition of passivity, allowed
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.460]   the world and his enemies to do even the worst unto him, passive resistance.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.660]   Now then, that, I say, is the controlling teaching.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.260]   And therefore, there are so many in the world tonight who say, "Well, yes, I know that's
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.060]   the teaching, but isn't it utterly futile?
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.820]   What has it achieved?
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.820]   What has it done?"
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:20.700]   Now then, we spent our time last Sunday evening in showing you how utterly and entirely wrong
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.900]   that teaching was.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:28.700]   We simply took it along these lines, that to start with, the gospel never promises and
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.900]   never offers to improve the world.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.420]   That indeed, it prophesies the exact opposite.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.540]   We've got it in this very chapter.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.300]   He says, "Look here, you will hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.780]   That's going on right to the end," he says.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.260]   Indeed, it says that towards the end, things are likely to get much worse, so that the
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.980]   world, far from improving inevitably, is going to get very much worse at the end.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.700]   These kind of things, he says, wars and rumors of wars and earthquakes and pestilences and
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:05.660]   famines, he says, these are but the beginnings of sorrow.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.700]   Much worse is to come.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.580]   And indeed, we saw that in his teaching here, he not only says that the world is going to
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:22.260]   be like that, but he gives us an explanation of it and a reason for it, and the reason
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.220]   is the sin that is in the heart of man.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.360]   And therefore, we sum it up like this.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.580]   As regards the world, our Lord says, there is no hope.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.060]   The world is a doomed world, it's a condemned world.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.860]   The world is going to be destroyed, that's his teaching.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.460]   As that temple is going to be destroyed in Jerusalem, he said, as this whole city is
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.460]   going to be razed to the ground, so at the end of the world there is going to be judgment
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.380]   and destruction, that's his teaching.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:05.740]   He holds out no hope for the world, and therefore we deduce this, and this is the very message
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:14.120]   of the gospel, that our business is to be concerned about ourselves in such a world.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.020]   Ah, but that is the very point which I want to deal with this evening.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.620]   Precisely, says the modern man, now that's it, that's your evangelical teaching.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.700]   Now this is being said very freely, you evangelicals, they say, you are just interested in your
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.360]   own little soul, and in your personal salvation.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.060]   Why they say, look at it, in the whole world as it is this evening, with all these terrible
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.660]   forces messing themselves, and the whole world in its present state, you people are concerned
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.300]   just about saving your own little souls.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:51.820]   Why they say it's so selfish, it's so small, it's so self-centered, why not forget yourselves,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.060]   and go out and do something, politically and socially, and try and make the world a better
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.060]   place.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.620]   Come out, they say, of this narrow, selfish, cramped little position, and do something
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.500]   about the great world that's outside.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.820]   And of course that's the sort of thing that appeals to the newspaper reporters.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.140]   You see, it's a social, political matter.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.140]   So this is the thing, this is Christianity.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:23.000]   There is this criticism of our personal salvation, our personal emphasis.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.580]   Now, as that is the controlling idea, I feel that I must try to deal with it, God helping
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.580]   me.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:40.660]   It's to me, I say, the supreme tragedy, the last tragedy, that any man should ever find
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:46.900]   himself in hell for all eternity, because of this tragic misrepresentation of the gospel.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.980]   I speak with fervor, I speak with feeling, for this reason, that as a preacher of the
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:57.180]   gospel, I know that I shall have to stand and give an account of my own preaching and
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.820]   my own ministry.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.100]   I know that I shall have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and give an account
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.940]   of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:13.380]   Therefore, I say with the Apostle Paul, knowing the terror of the Lord, I persuade men.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:19.460]   I have a horror of finding myself at that judgment throne and being asked this question.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.340]   Why didn't you disabuse the minds of those people?
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.620]   Why didn't you tell them that the impression of Christianity that's given in the daily
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.960]   newspapers is a lie and a travesty and is not the truth?
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.980]   Why didn't you make it plain to them?
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.180]   Why didn't you alarm them into seeing it?
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.900]   That's why I come back to this subject this evening.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.580]   It's on my conscience.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.900]   I have a concern.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.840]   Very well then, I take it up, and let me try to deal with it as briefly as I can in this
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   way.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.700]   What is our reply to this charge, that the gospel of Jesus Christ as it's represented
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:02.020]   evangelically is narrow and selfish, instead of taking its big world view, and instead
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.340]   of dealing with the world situation, politically and socially?
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.460]   Well, my answers would be these.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:16.300]   This or the teaching that does that is guilty in that way of putting the world before the
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.300]   individual.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.860]   And that is something which I think I can show you.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.260]   The Bible never does.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.180]   It is something which the Lord Jesus Christ never did.
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:38.100]   Do you know that he was even criticized for not doing it?
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.020]   You see, even John the Baptist seems to have stumbled a little bit at this point.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:48.900]   Our Lord was there spending most of his time up in Galilee, preaching to a crowd of very
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.140]   poor and very humble people.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.780]   He didn't spend the whole of his time up in Jerusalem.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.300]   He didn't spend his time in addressing the Sanhedrin.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.100]   He didn't spend his time in drawing up resolutions to be sent to the emperor at Rome to right
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.340]   this political injustice, or to put that social wrong right.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.340]   Not a word of it.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.340]   Nothing.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.340]   Never did it at all.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.820]   He didn't seem to be concerned about these great things that were happening in the world
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   at that very time.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.820]   What does he do?
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:23.620]   Well, he preaches to a handful of simple, ordinary, apparently illiterate, poor people.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.300]   And you see, even John the Baptist is a bit troubled.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:32.380]   Poor John, he'd been lying there in prison for some six months, and so one day he picked
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.540]   out two of his followers and he said, "Go up to him."
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.860]   And he sent them, and this was their question, "Art thou he that should come, or do we
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.380]   look for another?"
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.860]   What John meant, you see, was this.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.660]   Look here, is it conceivable that you really are the Messiah and that you're spending
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.100]   your time in this way?
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.700]   Why don't you go up to Jerusalem?
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.060]   Why don't you set yourself up as the Jewish Messiah?
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.460]   Why don't you become a king?
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.020]   Why don't you raise an army?
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.740]   "Go back," said our Lord, "to these two men, and tell John again the things that
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.620]   you have seen and heard.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:14.020]   The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf are made
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:23.620]   to hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is being preached to the poor, to the poor.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.460]   And blessed is he that is not offended in me."
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.500]   Poor John, you see, was on the verge of being offended.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.020]   He felt this wasn't the program of the Messiah.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.100]   He'd misunderstood it.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.100]   He'd got this big view instead of this personal view that our Lord was teaching and following.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.900]   And of course, you remember that his own brothers did exactly the same thing with him.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.620]   In the seventh chapter of the gospel, according to St. John, you will find that his brothers
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.020]   came to him one day and said, "Look here, don't you know that there's a great feast
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.420]   on in Jerusalem?
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.300]   Why don't you go up and declare yourself?
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.580]   If you really are what you say, if you really believe what you're teaching, why don't
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.420]   you go up to Jerusalem and declare yourself?
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.820]   No man, they say, who's got the policy that you have and who claims what you claim, he
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.820]   doesn't hide himself.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.620]   He goes up and declares himself.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.220]   Why don't you go and do it?"
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.500]   And again, you read in John's gospel that after our Lord had worked the miracle of feeding
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:33.580]   the 5,000, we are told this, "And they came and they tried to take him by force to make
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.580]   him a king."
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.380]   They'd seen the miracle and they were amazed.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.580]   They said, "This must be the Messiah.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.980]   Well, now let's take hold of him.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.260]   He seems to be a little bit diffident.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.860]   He seems to be too modest.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.220]   He is meant to be a king.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.060]   They came and they tried by force to take him and to make him a king."
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.060]   That's John 6, 15.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:55.580]   And when he saw that they would try and take him by force to make him a king, Jesus departed
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.220]   up into a mountain himself alone.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.940]   He wouldn't be made a king.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.260]   He hasn't come to do that.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.780]   A man comes to him one day in the middle of a sermon and he says, "Master, speak to my
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.340]   brother that he divide the inheritance with me."
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.740]   And he turned to him and he said, "Man, who hath made me a judge or a divider over you,
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.180]   I haven't come from heaven to earth in order to deal with things like that.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.820]   I'm not a legal department.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.260]   I'm not a social department.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.500]   No, no, that's not my calling."
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.820]   And he begins to speak to them personally.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:31.180]   Well, I could give you endless illustrations of the same thing.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.740]   Our Lord always spoke to the individual.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.860]   You know the whole of the Sermon on the Mount is spoken to individuals.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.320]   That's where these other people go so wrong.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.340]   He wasn't addressing nations.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.820]   He wasn't speaking to companies of people.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.060]   He was speaking to the individual.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.700]   He said, "Thee and thou," if this happens to you, personal, individual, he wasn't talking
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.060]   about nations.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.700]   The Christian ethic was never meant for nations.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:08.060]   It is meant for the individual Christian believer who is poor in spirit and meek and who hungers
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.380]   and thirsts after righteousness and who mourns because of his sins.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.420]   He is always speaking to the individual.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:19.860]   And here in this great chapter, where he's even dealing with the destruction of a city
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.900]   and talking about the end of the world, his message is to individuals.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.340]   Because of this, he says, "What are you going to do about it?"
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.780]   He's talking to the individual.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.780]   He always did.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:36.980]   Oh, there are some glorious examples and illustrations of this.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:42.540]   And oh, how they do violence to him, leave alone his teaching, who deny this point and
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.060]   who try to ridicule it.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:51.380]   Do you see him on one occasion going to the house of a man called Jairus, whose little
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.900]   daughter was desperately ill and at the point of death?
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.820]   And there was a great crowd following him.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:04.660]   He was thronged by a great crowd, but suddenly he spoke and he uttered a very strange word.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.620]   It baffled the disciples.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.460]   He said, "Who hath touched me?"
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:16.340]   And the disciples said, "Thou seest the crowd thronging thee, and sayest thou, 'Who hath
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.340]   touched me?'"
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.780]   They said, "A thousand people are in a sense touching you, and are you asking, 'Who touched
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.780]   me?'
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.780]   Are you interested in individuals?"
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.460]   "Oh yes," said our Lord.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.820]   I perceived that virtue was gone out of me.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.140]   Some individual has touched me.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.700]   And of course he was right.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:42.420]   There was a poor woman in that great crowd, a woman with an issue of blood, who had suffered
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.300]   like this for many years and had tried many physicians, we are told, but was nothing bettered
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.340]   but rather made worse.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:54.540]   This poor woman, this solitary individual, this unknown woman, was there in the throng
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.220]   and in the crowd with her personal, individual need and she just touched the hem of his garment
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.220]   and he knew.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.220]   And he said, "Who touched me?"
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.660]   He was concerned about her.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.660]   The whole procession was held up while he dealt with this one woman.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.820]   That's his method.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.820]   These people who wouldn't represent him today say they have no time for the individual.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.780]   They are concerned with these great issues.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.660]   Yes, and to that extent they are denying their own Lord and Master.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:28.180]   But look at the supreme illustration and example of this.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:38.620]   There he is, crucified on a tree, dying on a cross with the weight of the sins of his
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:44.940]   people upon him, this awful, terrible weight that makes him cry out, "My God, my God,
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.740]   why hast thou forsaken me?
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.580]   He's doing something eternal.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.580]   He's dying."
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:57.020]   Yes, he's dying for the sins of the whole world in that sense.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:04.700]   And yet you remember that he's concerned about one of the thieves dying by his side.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:12.460]   And when this man begins to speak to him and says, "We are dying justly, but you are dying
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.460]   unjustly.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.060]   You've never done any wrong at all, Lord.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.780]   Remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.380]   Here is the one, I say, who's doing something cosmic and eternal, the one in whom things
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:29.100]   in heaven and earth and under the earth are all going to be reunited and reconciled to
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   God.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.960]   He's got upon him the weight of this universe, as it were.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.580]   And yet one individual in the midst of all that says, "Remember me."
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.500]   Did he turn to him and say, "Men, what you're talking about?
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.420]   I can't be interested in individuals.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   Don't be so personal.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.420]   Don't be so selfish.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:49.980]   Don't be so concerned about this cosmic matter," not a word.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:56.780]   He turned to this one man and he spoke to him at such an hour, at such a moment, with
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:06.340]   such a weight upon him, and said today, "Thou shall be with me in paradise."
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.620]   Oh, that's the Christian message, the Christian gospel.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.140]   Thank God for it.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.220]   That was his manner.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.940]   That was his method.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.500]   That was the way in which he always behaved.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.060]   And as you go on and watch his followers in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you'll
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.620]   always find that they did exactly the same thing.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:32.660]   I see no record whatsoever of the apostles meeting together in council to draw up a number
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:37.780]   of resolutions to send to a town council or a county council or a parliament or a prime
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.020]   minister or an emperor or anybody else, not a word.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.900]   They simply didn't do it.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.900]   What did they do?
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.060]   They preached to the individuals who were in front of them.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.660]   And they spoke to them, not about these great general questions, they spoke to them about
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:02.500]   their souls, about their condition, about their position.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.620]   I ask you to read your New Testament.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.060]   You needn't take my word for it.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.060]   There it is.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.700]   Isn't that the four gospels, isn't that the book of Acts, isn't that the message of all
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.700]   the epistles?
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:21.920]   And of course it is, and for this good reason.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:32.200]   This message starts with the fundamental proposition that the world as such cannot be reformed.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.020]   I mean by that in an ultimate sense.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.820]   There are temporary improvements, but you go back again, as even some of the historians
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.620]   are teaching us, the world goes round and round in cycles.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.060]   You think you're going up, ah, you suddenly find you're going down the other side.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:51.740]   There's no line of general advance, civilizations come and they go, no, no.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.580]   The Bible starts with it as a fundamental proposition that the world, because it sinned,
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.780]   because it listened to the devil, has fallen.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:06.580]   And the world, quay world, is under the doom and the curse and the wrath and the damnation
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.900]   of God.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.420]   I mustn't stay with this, I tried to bring that out last Sunday evening.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.380]   That is his pronouncement about the world, it cannot be improved.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.220]   And therefore I say, to give all your time to that is a waste of energy.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.780]   You're trying to do something that he says cannot be done.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.460]   He says there will be wars, there'll be rumors of wars, there'll be all these things.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.600]   Do what you will, you can't stop it.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:41.340]   Very well then, if that is so, what has the gospel got to say?
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:48.500]   Oh, this is exactly what it has to say, that though the world, quay world, is under this
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:59.300]   doom and damnation of God, and that nothing can save it from that final disaster and end,
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:08.740]   but nevertheless, individuals can be saved out of it, individuals.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.280]   The world can't be saved, but you and I can be saved.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.160]   Now that is the essential message of the gospel.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.240]   The other is a lie, because he says it's not going to be done, it cannot be done, the doom
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:29.680]   is coming for certain, but here he comes in with his gospel.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.840]   In spite of the doom of the world, you and I can be delivered, can be rescued.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   Why should we be concerned about this?
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.240]   Well, isn't it obvious?
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:48.000]   We are, after all, individuals.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.820]   The world is made up of individuals.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:57.920]   We come into this world one by one.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:04.300]   You see, we are so governed by this mass psychology today, this mob psychology, that we are forgetting
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.220]   some of the most fundamental truths about life.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:15.100]   You can mass produce motor cars, but not children, babies, you're born one by one, and that puts
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.900]   a stamp on individuality.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.060]   "Ah," you say, "but we're all human beings."
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:29.300]   I know we are, but we're all individuals and we're all different.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.100]   Don't we all know this full well, that in spite of all the things that we share and
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:39.020]   enjoy together in community, the really big and important things in life we do one by
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.020]   one?
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:45.460]   Oh, I'm not surprised that an atheistic of communism is doing away with the whole idea
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.100]   of marriage and the home.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.980]   It suits their book.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.620]   But you see, that isn't the biblical way.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:02.580]   The biblical way is marriage, one man, one woman coming together.
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.900]   That's its essential teaching.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.260]   No promiscuity here.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.460]   We are not animals in the jungle, one man, one woman.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:19.860]   These twain shall be made one flesh, individuality.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.980]   We don't love in the mass, do we?
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:28.020]   We love as individuals, and we pick out another individual.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.580]   We are attracted by an individual, and we love that individual.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:39.100]   How monstrous it is to try and get rid of this most glorious thing that pertains to
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.900]   us with these mass notions and ideas.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.340]   No, no, the big things in life are all personal.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:55.420]   Our joys are personal, our sorrows are personal, the heart knoweth its own bitterness.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:02.460]   You can feel absolutely alone in this great city of London with its teeming millions.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.460]   You say, "It's all right.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.460]   I see them rushing, and they're apparently happy, but I'm not."
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.840]   And you're left alone with your own misery and your own problems and your own unhappiness.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   We are alone.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   We are individuals.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.180]   All these great things are individual.
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:21.500]   And as we were born singly and alone, we will die singly and alone.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.380]   A lot of us may die at the same time, but still, you die as an individual, and everyone
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.860]   goes through it himself alone.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:37.620]   And we go on into eternity in exactly the same way, alone.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.820]   And that is why I say you should be concerned about this.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.380]   Stop thinking of the world for a moment.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.820]   That world is doomed.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.600]   That world is going to disaster.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   You can do what you like.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.260]   I'm not saying you shouldn't have politics.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.780]   Indeed, I could argue very easily that God has ordained politics to keep the world within
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.380]   order and within bounds, but nothing more than that.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.860]   Well, I say, go on with that if you like, but don't say that that's the gospel.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:06.260]   The gospel is to save us from the fate and the doom that's coming to that mass, that
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.260]   world.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.260]   We can be taken out of it.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.760]   That's its glorious promise.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:15.780]   That is the good news.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:22.220]   So I say that any representation of this message, this gospel, which doesn't start with the
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:27.060]   individual and end with him, which doesn't emphasize the importance of the individual,
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.860]   is a denial of it, it's a travesty of it.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.860]   My dear friend, this is the position.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:44.060]   The world and all who belong to it is going to that doom and that disaster.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.260]   What about you?
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.260]   You do what you like.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.260]   You sweat.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.260]   You work.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.260]   You do anything.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.900]   Join every organization that you can conceive of to try and stop that.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.980]   You won't stop it.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.380]   It's coming.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:05.260]   Very well, then, I say, the essence of wisdom is this, am I irretrievably bound up with
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.260]   that?
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.500]   Can nothing be done?
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.660]   Is there no way of escape?
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.380]   Am I inextricably involved in this doom and final destruction?
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.460]   And the Bible says, "No, you're not."
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.460]   You, as an individual, count in the sight of God.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.140]   Didn't you notice the teaching?
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.460]   The very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.980]   The God who made the whole universe out of nothing.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:33.220]   The God who plays with the stars and the constellations, even as a child with marbles.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.140]   The God who said, "Let there be and there was."
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:44.460]   This infinite, eternal, everlasting God is interested in us one by one, and we're all
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.900]   accountable to him one by one.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.140]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is individualistic.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.540]   It is personal.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.500]   It sees no hope for the world.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.060]   It sees every hope for the individual who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.380]   Oh, yes, we must assert this and say that the other is the lie of hell.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.620]   It's a misrepresentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.980]   It is misleading the masses of the people.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.460]   But let me say a second thing.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.680]   This other teaching puts the body before the soul.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.140]   I don't hesitate to say that.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:28.140]   Have you ever noticed so much concern about the destruction of the body as you have at
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.180]   the present time?
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.700]   Did you read that debate in the House of Lords only this last week?
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.540]   And that's what most of them were concerned about, you know, the destruction of the body.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.860]   The body is more important than the soul.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.700]   They don't believe in the soul.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.580]   These great philosophers, they think of man as but an animal.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.580]   It's a body.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.580]   That's the thing they're interested in.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:56.300]   And, of course, death is regarded as the supreme calamity.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.380]   Nothing is more terrible to them than death.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.340]   Why, they say, if you don't stop this, if we don't renounce the bomb in this country
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:07.700]   and set a moral example and shock the world out of its folly, why, they say, we're all
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:12.300]   going to be killed together and that's the last calamity, that's the most awful thing.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.920]   If we are killed, why, that's the end and there's no more.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.300]   That's their view.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:25.980]   There is nothing to them that is worse than death.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:32.300]   And you notice that at once, they're in a position that is entirely different from that
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:38.580]   which is taught in the Bible and especially in the New Testament.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:45.060]   The whole teaching of the New Testament is this, that the important thing about a man
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:50.620]   is not his body but his soul.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:57.740]   What shall it profit a man, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.180]   What's the man in this world for?
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.620]   Is it to preserve his body?
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.020]   Is it just to keep on living?
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.740]   Is it just to extend the number of years that he's in this world?
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.820]   What a view of life!
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.620]   What a view of man!
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:15.020]   Mere extension of the number of years so that I go on living a little bit longer in this
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.020]   world, this present evil world.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.020]   That's the view.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:25.780]   Death, the final calamity, nothing more terrible than death.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.540]   But you notice from my reading at the beginning that that wasn't our Lord's view.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.740]   Listen to Him.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:38.420]   You see, these disciples of His were afraid of death and death to them was the most awful
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.700]   thing that could happen.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.540]   He's sending them out to preach.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.660]   And He says, "Now be careful, don't you think that everybody's going to receive you with
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.380]   open arms because they're not going to.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.860]   You will be hated of all men for my name's sake.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.340]   Don't think," they said, "they'll open your arms and embrace you.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.100]   No, no, they'll take up stones and throw them at you as they've done with me.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.100]   They'll arrest you.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.620]   They'll cry you before their synagogues and they'll take you before their magistrates.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.540]   You shall be hated of all men for my name's sake."
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:11.660]   "Indeed," He said, "they may even arrest you and put you to death."
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:22.100]   And then He said this wonderful thing, "Fear not them that are able to kill the body, but
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.420]   are not able to kill the soul."
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:29.460]   The gospel according to St. Luke chapter 12 is the same passage, even better.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.540]   It puts it like this, "Fear not them that are able to kill the body, but after that
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.700]   have nothing that they can do unto you.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:49.660]   But rather, I say unto you, fear him which hath power to destroy both soul and body in
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.660]   hell.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:55.740]   Yea, I say unto you, fear him."
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.740]   This is His view.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.660]   He says, "Don't be afraid of men.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.080]   Men after all can only destroy your bodies.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.180]   The utmost that a man can do is to kill you and to destroy your body, but he can't do
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.180]   more.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.180]   He can't kill your soul.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:14.820]   But you see today the whole of the emphasis is upon the body.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.980]   We are going to be killed, our bodies are going to be destroyed, and this is the excitement.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   Our life in this world must be extended, and if we are shortened by a year, what a terrible
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.020]   thing it is, living in this world.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.460]   It's everything.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:37.660]   And any view which thus puts its emphasis upon the life of the body at the expense of
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:44.820]   the life of the soul, and that gives the impression that the supreme calamity is the death of
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.620]   the body, is a denial of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:54.580]   Oh, I'll tell you what the final calamity is, the death of the soul.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.500]   He that saveth his life shall lose it.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.620]   Let's say these men got their way, and that all the bombs were destroyed, they've saved
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.100]   their lives, there's never to be another war.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.420]   Man has signed an agreement, never another, of course it will never happen, the Bible
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.740]   has told us it won't, but let's even assume that it did happen, they've saved their lives.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.740]   What have they saved?
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.740]   Oh, they've only saved the life of a body for an extra few days, perhaps weeks, perhaps
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.540]   months, perhaps years.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:32.700]   He that saveth his life shall lose it, but he that loseth his life for my sake shall
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   save it.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.140]   What makes a man a man is his soul, not his body.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:42.020]   And the thing to be concerned about and to learn about is the man's soul, but all the
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.220]   attention today is on the body.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.300]   And Christian pulpits have given over to preaching the salvation of the body, and only a few
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   years at most, because it's still got to die, bombs or not, wars or not, and where's the
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.300]   soul?
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.740]   "Ah," they say, "but that's selfish, self-centered, you're just a little individual talking about
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.380]   saving your own little soul."
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.300]   Oh yes, I want to save my soul, I'll tell you why.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.060]   It isn't a little thing, it's the biggest thing of all.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.180]   It's the thing that God breathed into me.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.840]   It's the thing that goes on to all eternity.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.580]   It's my body that's small, this is only temporary, this is only a tabernacle that I'm in for
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.580]   a while.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.580]   Oh, it's the biggest thing in the universe.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.340]   It's bigger than the whole world itself.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:29.660]   What shall it profit a man, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:30.660]   Well let me hurry on.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.860]   My next argument is this, that this other representation puts life in this world before
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   life in the next.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.300]   It follows, doesn't it, from what I've just been saying.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:46.580]   And if there is anything that is completely and entirely unchristian, it is that.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.900]   Of course, you know the way of putting it, don't you?
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.100]   You know the clever way of putting it.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.460]   When I say clever, I mean the way in which it's put by Tom, Dick, and Harry on the street
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:02.900]   corner and Tom, Dick, and Harry on the Brainstrust on Sunday afternoon.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.620]   Because there is no difference between them, none at all.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:13.880]   Tom, Dick, and Harry put it like this, "We are not interested," they say, "in your pie
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.880]   in the sky."
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.820]   Pie in the sky, practical men of reality, this world.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:27.540]   Well, all they're doing, I say, is to proclaim that they're in an exact opposite position
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.540]   from the Scriptures.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.140]   Let me grant them this, they're perfectly logical.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:40.700]   They have no conception of the soul, they have no conception of man, made in the image
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.940]   of God.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.340]   And they believe that when a man dies, it's exactly like that flower dying, like a tree
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.580]   falling or a horse falling dead, it's the end.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.980]   They know of nothing beyond this world and that's why they're so concerned about living
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.980]   in this, you see.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.020]   That's why they get excited about these bombs and think that Christianity's main business
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:03.020]   is to stop war, extending life in this world.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.020]   Why?
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.180]   Well, because they know nothing of another world.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.300]   I say they're perfectly logical.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:17.460]   But it is the very antithesis of the Christian position and the Christian teaching.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.460]   What is the Christian teaching on this matter?
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.460]   It's this.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.180]   Let me give you a summary of it.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:27.100]   The Christian teaching does not despise life in this world, of course it doesn't.
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:32.580]   It says it's God's world and it says we should make a right and a full use of it.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.780]   We should use it but not abuse it.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:40.020]   It says we should make it as beautiful as we can and we should have it as ordered as
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.020]   is possible.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.020]   Why?
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.020]   Well, because it's God's world.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:47.300]   No, no, Christianity doesn't despise life in this world.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.060]   Well, what does it do?
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.800]   It takes a true view of it.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.300]   And what is the true view of it?
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.020]   Well, I've told you.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:05.060]   It says this world is as it is because of sin, because of men's rebellion against God,
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:09.980]   because of men's disobedience.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:16.980]   It says men, in many ways, have made life in this world a living hell.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.260]   This is the typical New Testament attitude.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:24.060]   Let me quote you the words of the Apostle Paul, "In this tabernacle we do groan, being
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.060]   burdened."
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:32.760]   This, my friends, is a land of sin and woe.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.140]   The world, according to this view, is indeed a terrible place.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.980]   And don't you begin to agree?
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.260]   Read your newspapers.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.260]   Look what's happening.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:49.980]   The world, says the Scripture, is a terrible place, very well.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.740]   But you see, it goes on to say this.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.620]   This is not the only world.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.740]   There is another world.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:08.260]   "Our light affliction," says the Apostle Paul, in 2 Corinthians 4, 17 and 18, "our
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:16.860]   light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.620]   weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.620]   are not seen.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:29.900]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:35.060]   And if the earthly house of this our tabernacle were dissolved, if we die, we have a building
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:41.220]   of God, a house not made in with hands, eternal in the heavens."
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:46.940]   That's the Christian view and the Christian teaching.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.320]   Death is not the end.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.100]   Death is but the end of a life of sin and shame.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:43:01.460]   Death is but going out of this evil world with all its horrors and all its bestiality,
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:07.260]   ne'er too well to be with Christ, which is far better to me.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:13.540]   To live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.540]   Look at the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:22.500]   Look at all those mighty men who are mentioned there, Noah and all the rest of them, Abram,
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.780]   Moses, all these mighty men.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.620]   What was their view of life?
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.660]   Well, they said, "We are not living for this world.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.680]   We are strangers and pilgrims."
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.700]   These men have got their eyes set upon another land.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.580]   They accounted themselves strangers and pilgrims in the world.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:45.420]   They were seeking for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   They said, "No, no.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.420]   Even temples collapse.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.540]   Even the whole world is going.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.700]   We don't live for this.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.300]   We are but strangers and pilgrims.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   We are sojourners and travelers.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.100]   We are making for our home.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:03.140]   There is a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:07.740]   That's the Christian teaching.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:13.660]   The Christian teaching, you see, puts its main emphasis upon the world that is to come.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.900]   We are only travelers here.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.620]   We are not here forever, but there we are going to be there forever.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.220]   This is a transient, temporary life, and isn't a man who doesn't believe that a fool?
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:28.140]   It's true of all of us, but that life hath no ending.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.500]   It's eternal.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.340]   It's everlasting.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.620]   So all this emphasis on the present rather than the future, this world rather than the
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.960]   next, is an utter denial of Christianity.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.060]   And yet you notice so much today is represented as Christianity, which puts the whole of its
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.540]   emphasis upon this present world.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:58.500]   And lastly, and for me to close, what I object to supremely about this travesty of Christianity,
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:07.360]   this gross misrepresentation of it, this lie that is issued in the name of Christ, is this,
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.260]   that it would rob him of his central glory.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:19.860]   And his central glory is to be found in his death upon the cross.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.980]   What was he doing there?
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:27.460]   Ah, we are told, as I've reminded you, that that is the supreme illustration of passive
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.900]   resistance.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.180]   He was just putting into practice his own teaching.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.340]   And his own teaching is, don't defend yourself.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:43.860]   So you apply that to nations, you say, don't re-arm.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.420]   And they said his teaching is this, that if you only do that and give this illustration
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:56.060]   and example this gesture of love, why, the other nations will be shocked.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:00.620]   Because you've destroyed your bombs, they'll destroy their bombs, and there'll never be
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:01.620]   another war.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:06.480]   If only one nation did it, the example, the illustration, the moral influence would be
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.140]   so shattering upon the others, they'd all immediately send away all their armies, destroy
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.980]   all their bombs, and turn all their swords into plowshares.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.980]   That's his teaching.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.060]   He's simply calling upon us to do it.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:25.200]   And if we all just refused to fight and to do these things, as he did upon the cross,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.540]   the whole course of human history would be changed.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.900]   That's the representation of the cross.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:40.500]   Oh, what a travesty.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.820]   Is that but a moral gesture?
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.660]   Is that nothing but passive resistance?
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:54.020]   Is he simply there because he hasn't chosen to defend himself?
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:47:00.860]   God knows what a lie.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   He set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:13.780]   It wasn't that he was caught or taken there, he went there deliberately.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.380]   He knew what was going to happen.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:25.260]   He said, "For this hour came I into this world."
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.100]   What has he come for?
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:38.140]   The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:42.820]   a ransom for many.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:48.240]   He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:52.180]   Or if I may again quote the author of the epistle to the Hebrews in his second chapter
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:57.220]   and in his ninth verse, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:07.220]   death, "that he might taste death for every man."
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:13.480]   My dear friend, there on that cross was happening the biggest, the most momentous thing the
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.620]   world has ever known or ever can.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.620]   What was it?
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:22.100]   It was a transaction between the Son of God and God the Father.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:28.480]   It was the Heavenly Father taking these sins of yours and mine and putting them on his
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.760]   own Son.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.780]   And it was He who smote him.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:43.900]   It wasn't men, it was God, wounded for our transgressions, smitten for our iniquities.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:51.060]   No, no, the cross of Christ has never had this moral influence upon anybody.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:55.500]   But what it has had is this, it is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:00.340]   It is God's way of rescuing, redeeming individuals.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:08.100]   Their sins were laid upon the Son.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.740]   He came in order to die.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:16.640]   His death was not a calamity, it wasn't an accident, it didn't result from the malignity
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.060]   of men, no, no, God sent him to die.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.060]   He said, "Here am I, send me in the eternal counsel."
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:31.740]   And when the fullness of the times must come, God sent him.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.900]   He came deliberately to die.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:45.460]   His purpose was to die because without this death of his there would be no deliverance,
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:53.720]   no redemption, no rescue for any single individual.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:50:07.760]   My dear friend, the world is doomed, but you can be saved out of the doom and the destruction.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:16.820]   And all you have to do is to realize that the Son of God can save you from it, for he
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:23.240]   has borne your sins that lead with the sins of others to that doom.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.840]   And in him they can be forgiven.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:34.760]   In him you can be reconciled to God, so that when the final calamity and disaster comes,
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.320]   you will not be involved.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.400]   Is this narrow-pity selfishness?
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.120]   I say it is eminently common sense.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.920]   The world cannot be saved.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.080]   You can.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:58.880]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, be ye saved.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:07.680]   Amen.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.600]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
