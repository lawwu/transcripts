[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   A new subscription in the Arsenal is a product called Stable and it is a virtual mailbox.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   Primary reason many people might want this is for their business.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.840]   Instead of getting a bunch of mail sent to your home,
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   instead of having your home address show up all over the internet
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.920]   because business addresses are made public, switch to something like Stable.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.360]   Send all your mail there.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.520]   They'll scan it or ship it back out to you.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.280]   So easy to manage.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.600]   It's basically like the only business address you ever need.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.040]   The greatest thing is I also use it for a lot of personal stuff.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.000]   So if you want to make sure your address is not removed,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.960]   I'll talk about that in one of my next services.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.400]   But if you really just want to make sure you get a little bit more privacy
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   on the personal side or the business side,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.240]   or you just want the convenience of accessing mail even when you're traveling,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.760]   it's been an incredible service.
