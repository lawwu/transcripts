[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   everyone and welcome you to Intermediate Biblical Counseling. This is our session number six and
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.120]   glad you're able to join us tonight. I hope you all had a wonderful week and that the Lord has
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.640]   been blessing your walks with Christ and also your study in God's Word. And I trust that as
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   you work through these essays that you're being both challenged and blessed by putting pen to paper
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.840]   and putting down on paper some of the most precious truths that are found in life,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.600]   which is our convictions about the Word of God. And so I'm really glad that you've joined us
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.760]   tonight. If you have any questions or any feedback on the course materials as we go along, please feel
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   free to use the chat function or also the Q&A function in your webinar and we'd be happy to
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.840]   address any questions that you might have. Tonight this is session number six in our study of the
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.440]   theology exam topics, and we're going to be looking at tonight the noetic effects of sin.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:12.080]   We introduced that idea last week, the whole idea of sin's effects on the mind, on the intellect of
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.600]   the unbeliever, and how does that relate to the counseling conversation that we have.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.240]   How does that relate to our methodology and counseling and how we interact with integrationists
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.280]   and secular psychologists. So I'm glad you joined us. I hope we'll have a great time of study tonight.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.400]   Just as we open our session tonight, I want to read from Ephesians chapter 2, verses 1 to 7,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.800]   and both give you a devotional thought from God's Word, and then also to help us
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.120]   understand from this passage how the doctrine of sin leads us to understand the work of Christ
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.920]   and also to celebrate God's grace. So let me read from Ephesians chapter 2, verses 1 to 7.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.320]   Paul says, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.000]   to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air of the spirit
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.800]   that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lust
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.720]   of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.600]   children of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.760]   with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   with Christ, by grace you have been saved, and raised us up with him and seated us with him in
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.320]   the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show the surpassing
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:07.040]   riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus." For a brief moment, I want us to
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.200]   think about the truth that Paul says in chapter 2, verse 1, "And you were dead in your sins and
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.600]   trespasses." My favorite illustration of the deadness aspect of the teaching in Ephesians
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:33.920]   chapter 2, verse 1, is found in R.C. Sproul's book, Chosen by God, and in that book, Sproul gives the
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.280]   following illustration that I think is helpful for us to understand the doctrine of sin and
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.080]   especially that whole idea of being dead in sins and trespasses. He says, "Consider an analogy of
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.520]   a person who is suffering from a terminal illness. The sinner is said to be gravely ill on the brink
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.440]   of physical death. He does not have it within his own power to cure himself of the disease.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.880]   He is lying on his deathbed, almost totally paralyzed. He cannot recover unless God provides
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.400]   the healing medicine. The man is so bad off that he cannot even stretch forth his arm to receive
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.920]   the medicine. He is almost comatose. God must not only offer the medicine, but God must put it on a
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.640]   spoon and place it by the dying man's lips. Unless God does all that, the man will surely perish.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:37.840]   But though God does 99% of what is necessary, the man is still left with 1%. The man must open his
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.600]   mouth to receive the medicine. This is the necessary exercise of free will that makes
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.080]   the difference between heaven and hell. The man who opens his mouth to receive the gracious gift
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   of the medicine will be saved. The man who keeps his lips tightly clenched will perish."
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:04.160]   So, that seems to be, at first, to be a pretty good analogy of the gospel call.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.960]   If you open your mouth, you will be saved, and if you close your mouth, then you will perish.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.840]   But Sproul denies that this analogy is in harmony with the truth of true conversion.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.440]   He writes that the analogy that I've just described almost does justice to the Bible
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.200]   and to Paul's teaching of the grace of regeneration. But in the end, it falls short
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:39.280]   of the biblical picture. The Bible does not speak of mortally ill sinners. According to Paul,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.600]   they are dead. There is not an ounce of spiritual life left in them. If they are to be made alive,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.080]   God must do more than offer them medicine. Dead men will not open their mouths to receive
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.400]   anything. Their jaws are locked in death. Rigor mortis has set in. They must be raised
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.280]   from the dead. They must be new creations crafted by Christ and reborn by his Spirit.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   Sproul makes there the simple point that men are not just sick in their sin. They are dead
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:21.360]   in their sins and their trespasses, and therefore, they need not only for God to put the medicine
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:29.280]   near their mouths, they need to be spiritually resurrected from the dead. So, just in case we
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.600]   think we got the point there, Sproul's going to hammer that in with a second illustration,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.640]   and this is actually my favorite illustration in that book. He says, "Consider a drowning man who
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.800]   is unable to swim. He has gone under twice and bobbed to the surface for the last time. If he
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.680]   goes under again, he will die. His only hope is for God to throw him a life preserver. God throws
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.080]   the lifeline and tosses it precisely to the edge of the man's outstretched fingers. All the man has
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.640]   to do to be saved is to grab hold of the life preserver. If he will only grab hold of the
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.600]   life preserver, God will tow him in. If he refuses the life preserver, he will certainly perish."
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   And again, this seems to be a pretty good illustration of
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.240]   the gospel invitation. "Grab on to the life preserver, and you will be saved."
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.320]   But Sproul writes this, "Again, in this illustration, the utter helplessness of
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.120]   sinful man without God's assistance is emphasized. The drowning man is in a serious condition.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.560]   He cannot save himself. However, the illustration is incomplete because the man in the story is
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   still alive. He can still stretch forth his fingers. His fingers are the crucial link to
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.440]   salvation. His eternal destiny depends upon what he does with his fingers."
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:09.040]   But, and here's the key observation in the illustration, in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1,
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:17.440]   Paul says the man is dead. He is not merely drowning. He is dead. He has already sunk to
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:24.080]   the bottom of the sea. It is futile to throw a life preserver to a man who has already drowned.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:31.280]   If man is to be saved, God must dive into the water and pull a dead man from the bottom of
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:38.720]   the sea, and then perform a divine act of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. God must breathe
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:47.520]   into the dead man new life. And that is exactly what Paul says that God has done for us in our
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:56.160]   salvation in Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 to 7. It's not just that God threw us a life preserver
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.120]   and said, "You catch it." It's that we were dead. We were drowned at the bottom of the ocean. God
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:12.320]   came down and found us, and he miraculously caused us to be born again, and he imparted to us
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:21.120]   new life in Christ. Now, if you understand the doctrine of sin as it's found in verses 1 to 3,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.720]   and Paul goes on to say more things about the doctrine of sin, but we'll just leave it there
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:34.160]   with the whole idea of spiritual deadness before Christ. He then says in verse 4,
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:43.840]   "Why is it that God would find a dead man and breathe into that person new life?"
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:53.760]   It was because, verse 4, he was great in mercy. He did so because, verse 4, he was
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:03.760]   great in love because of the great love with which he loved us when we were dead in our trespasses.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:13.360]   God made us alive in Christ, and he did so that, in verse 7, it says, "So that in the ages to come
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:21.440]   he might show the surpassing riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.800]   When you really understand the doctrine of sin, and this is how I'm going to segue into our
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:36.560]   subject for tonight, when you really grasp the extent of sin, the effects of sin,
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.960]   the influence of sin, when you really come to terms with the unbeliever's spiritual condition
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:51.280]   of being dead in sin, of being a slave to sin, where it leads you in your understanding of the
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:11:00.160]   gospel is a greater understanding and appreciation of God's grace, a greater appreciation and
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:09.120]   understanding of the greatness of God's love, the greatness of his mercy, and as verse 7 calls it,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:17.680]   "the surpassing riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus." It leads you
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:27.440]   to celebrate and to be in awe and wonder of amazing grace. If your heart is not moved to
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.720]   seeing amazing grace and to stand amazed, freshly amazed, each and every day at the
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.920]   greatness of God's grace, then perhaps you need to go back to the doctrine of sin,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:48.160]   and when you are grounded in the doctrine of sin, it will cause you to rejoice in your Savior's
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.120]   love. With that said, tonight we're looking at one of the aspects of that study of the doctrine
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.680]   of sin. We're looking at the noetic effects of sin, but my prayer is that this study will lead
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:10.800]   us to a fresh appreciation as to the amazing grace of God and salvation that we would be able to
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.280]   praise him and worship him and be lost in wonder, love, and praise. So, let's pray together and
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:25.360]   devote our time to the Lord. Father, we do bow before you tonight, and I thank you for each
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:34.000]   of my brothers and sisters who are studying your word and joining us for tonight's session, and
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.840]   I pray that you would bless them and encourage them as they continue in their training.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:48.640]   I pray that, Lord, the understanding of your word and an understanding of the doctrine of sin would
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:57.760]   lead us to a great understanding of how amazing your grace really is, that you loved us not
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.720]   because there was anything in us that was lovely. You loved us not because we could love you in
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:12.640]   return. You loved us simply because it is in your nature to love, and you not only sent your son to
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:20.800]   die for our sins, you made us alive in Christ. You caused us to be born again. You granted to us the
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:29.280]   gift of sovereign regeneration, and you opened our eyes to see the beauty and the glory of your son,
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:36.880]   Jesus Christ. Lord, help us to handle these truths carefully. Help us to think deeply and clearly.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.360]   Help us to think biblically, and we pray that, Father, you would grant that the result of this
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:50.160]   study would not be an essay, but that, Lord, it would be a heart that worships and praises you,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:57.600]   for we know that you indeed have been gracious to us, and so we just give our time to you,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:08.480]   and we pray all this in Jesus' precious name. Amen. Amen. Okay, we are looking at theology exam
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.840]   number six. This is, as I mentioned, the topic dealing with the noetic effects of sin.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.920]   Heath Lambert's chapter three in the theology of biblical counseling is going to be very helpful
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.480]   to you in writing this essay. I really encourage you to read that chapter carefully, especially
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:34.320]   the second half of chapter three is going to be very helpful in relating the doctrine of
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.760]   the noetic effects of sin to the issue of counseling, but let's read the question together.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.520]   The question is, "Explain the doctrine of the noetic effects of sin relating the doctrine to
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:51.440]   the ability of secular psychologists to understand true information about the human condition."
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.080]   Last week, we introduced the idea that the term noetic comes from the Greek word nous,
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:06.160]   n-o-u-s, and that word simply means mind, so when we're looking at the noetic effects of sin,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:14.480]   we are looking at sin's effects on the mind. How does sin affect the human intellect? How
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:23.040]   unbelievers think about life and about intellectual disciplines? Now, I've given
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.520]   you way more information on your handout that you need to write this essay, but I did think this was
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.440]   necessary because we do need to understand the broader look at the doctrine of sin before we
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:42.960]   narrow in on understanding sin's effects on the mind, and also I found just in general that
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:49.120]   teaching on the doctrine of sin and the church's understanding of the doctrine of sin
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.080]   really has been in short supply, and as I mentioned, it's not that we so much enjoy
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:04.400]   studying all about the doctrine of sin and its effects upon man, but understanding the doctrine
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.800]   of sin is necessary to understanding the gospel. It's necessary for understanding the greatness
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:17.040]   of God's grace and his love toward us in Christ. If you have a weak understanding of the doctrine
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.880]   of sin, you're going to have a weak understanding of the gospel, a weak appreciation of the
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:30.160]   greatness of Christ, a weak appreciation of how amazing God's grace really is. On your handout,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:38.720]   I put J.C. Ryle's statement where he says, "Dim or indistinct views of sin are the origin of most
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.080]   of the errors, heresies, and false doctrines of the present day. If a man does not realize
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.040]   the dangerous nature of his soul's disease, you cannot wonder if he is content with false or
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.360]   imperfect remedies. I believe that one of the chief needs of the contemporary church has been
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:17:01.680]   and is clearer fuller teaching about sin." That's a really interesting statement there, and I think
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:08.800]   that's really helpful for us. When is the last time you said to your pastor, "Pastor, what I
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:15.760]   really want to hear is clearer, fuller teaching about sin." When is the time that you felt in your
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:24.160]   own heart that, "What I need to really grow in my love for Christ is clearer, fuller teaching about
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:32.000]   sin." But the truth is that if we don't have fuller, clearer teaching about sin, then we won't
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.200]   have a full and clear understanding of the person and work of Jesus Christ. 1 Timothy 1, verse 15,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.480]   "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came to the world to
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:52.720]   save sinners, of whom I am foremost." So, just mark it down as sin is being redefined today.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.440]   I have some notes on your handout there that in the world of secular psychology, sin is being
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:09.040]   redefined as a disorder or a syndrome. Here are some ways that sin is being redefined. Letter A,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:18.000]   some say sin is a lack of self-esteem. This was popularized by Robert Schuller in his work,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.040]   "Self-Esteem, the New Reformation." Schuller said that the first reformation was
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.960]   justification by faith, and the second reformation is the rediscovery of self.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:35.920]   He says, "What I mean by sin, answer, any human condition or act that robs God of his glory by
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:42.320]   stripping one of his children of the right to divine dignity. I can offer still another answer.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:48.800]   Sin is any act or thought that robs myself or another being of his or her self-esteem. The core
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:57.760]   of sin is lack of self-esteem. And what is hell? Hell is the loss of pride that naturally follows
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:07.680]   separation from God. A person is in hell when he has lost his self-esteem." And just in case you
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   think that this redefinition of sin is gone in our generation, just listen to Joel Osteen on
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:24.000]   the subject of self-esteem. This is on the slide here. He says, "Allow me to tell you who you
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.800]   really are. You are talented. You are valuable. You are confident. You have been handpicked by
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   the creator of the universe on the inside of you. Right now is a victorious, successful
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:44.720]   world changer just waiting to break out. Your butterfly is waiting to soar."
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:52.240]   So, that's just echoing the teaching of secular psychology. Inside of you is goodness, and light,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.840]   and potential, and if you haven't blossomed, it's your teacher's fault, or your parents' fault,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:06.720]   or your family's fault. And Osteen writes, "I'm asking you to release the full you.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:13.840]   You are destined to leave your mark on your generation. There's no limit to what God can
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.000]   do in you and through you when you reprogram your thinking and start believing that you're blessed,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.720]   valuable, one of a kind, and more than a conqueror. When you renew your mind, transformation takes
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:37.280]   place. Your butterfly is waiting to soar." So, John the Baptist got it wrong when he said,
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.360]   "You brood of vipers." He should have said, "You bunch of beautiful butterflies that are just
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:50.880]   waiting to soar." That's the new reformation. Sin is being redefined. Sin is being redefined
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:58.400]   as a lack of self-esteem, and when you get the doctrine of sin wrong, you will have the gospel
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:08.720]   wrong. So, this is the new reformation. On your handout, you have letter B, "Sin as a disease
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:15.120]   model." We no longer have sins that need to be repented of. We have disorders that need to be
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:23.360]   managed. The DSM has conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, antisocial personality disorder,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:30.960]   intermittent explosive disorder. So, the idea is if I explode at you and rage
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.440]   that I don't have a sin problem, I have a disorder.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:47.840]   So, I have IED, and you should feel sorry for me because I'm just a poor, needy victim
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:56.640]   who has a disorder that needs to be managed instead of I am a sinner who is in need of
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.320]   repentance and forgiveness through the grace that is in the Lord Jesus Christ. You see how
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:11.120]   attractive this kind of teaching is, how it appeals to the pride and the self-will of man.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:19.040]   Carl Menninger asked this question, and he was a secular psychologist. He's not writing from
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:26.720]   a Christian perspective, but he lamented the lack of understanding of sin, even from a secular
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.880]   perspective. He said, "Has no one committed any sins? Where indeed did sin go? What became
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.400]   of it?" Now, when an unbeliever is saying, "What happened to the doctrine of sin?" you know that
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:47.440]   we need to take care to rearticulate the doctrine and understand it for our own lives.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.960]   And then you have letter C on your handout, the victimization model. "I'm not a sinner. I'm a
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.080]   victim." This starts all the way back in the garden. Adam said, "The woman whom you gave me
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.760]   to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree, and I ate." Adam was basically saying,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.360]   "It's not my fault, God, that I ate the fruit. It's the woman's fault, and it's not her fault,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.120]   God. It's really your fault because you're the one who gave me the woman. It's everyone's fault,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:21.760]   but mine." And you see that dynamic being played out in so many people today.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:29.600]   It's the victim model. "I'm not a sinner. I'm not responsible. I'm a victim." So
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.600]   we could say much more about that, but let me move on. Sin is being redefined,
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:43.200]   and when you redefine sin, you redefine the gospel. If you don't get sin right, then
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.520]   you don't get the remedy right. You have to get the diagnosis right before you give
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:56.880]   the cure. So let me move to, I think this is the next page of your handout, "The Doctrine of
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:06.320]   Original Sin." "The Doctrine of Original Sin." Anthony Hokema defines the doctrine of original
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:13.600]   sin in this way, "Original sin is the sinful state and condition in which every human is born."
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:23.520]   "Original sin is the sinful state and condition in which every human is born." And it's called
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:30.400]   original sin because it's derived from the original root of the human race, Adam.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:41.920]   So let me give you a diagram here. I'm trying to come up with a little bit better artwork for these
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:51.360]   PowerPoint presentations, but you'll have to go with it for a moment. If you look at the bottom
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.600]   part of that illustration, and let's just say that I just put Dan, but you could write your
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:05.360]   name in there, any sinner's name in that bottom stick figure. And let's say Dan has sins in his
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:12.560]   life, and you might look at that person and say, "Well, that person has a sin problem," and you
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:23.840]   would be correct. But the doctrine of original sin says that my sin is related to the original
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:31.440]   root of the human race, which is Adam. So there's a relationship there that's indicated by the arrow.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:39.040]   There's a relationship between Dan the sinner and the original root of the human race, Adam,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.480]   and that's the relationship that we need to understand if we're going to understand
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:55.120]   the doctrine of sin. On your handout, you have the statement by the Westminster Confession of Faith,
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:02.800]   which says this, "Our first parents, being seduced by the subtlety and temptations of Satan,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:10.480]   sinned in eating the forbidden fruit. By this sin, they fell from their original
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:17.520]   righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin and wholly defiled."
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.280]   You want to circle those two words, "wholly defiled." We'll get back to that in a moment.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:30.080]   "They became wholly defiled in all the parts and faculties of soul and body,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:37.840]   they being the root of all mankind. The guilt of this sin was imputed,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:45.520]   and the same death and sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity descending from
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:52.160]   them by ordinary generation. From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed,
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.880]   disabled, and made opposite to all good and wholly inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:08.320]   transgressions." So, there is a relationship between my sin at the bottom of that diagram
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:17.360]   and the sin of Adam. What exactly is that relationship? The Westminster Confession of Faith
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:25.120]   helps us understand that. You have there, "Adam is the root of mankind."
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:34.880]   I have a sin problem because there is a relationship between me and the original
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:44.800]   root, Adam, and you notice there I just switched the arrows around so that they're facing
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:53.200]   downward there, but the nature of the relationship is twofold, and you'll find
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:28:00.800]   this in the language of the Westminster Confession of Faith. There is, first of all, imputed guilt,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:11.040]   imputed guilt, otherwise known as original guilt. From the confession, it says,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:19.360]   "They, being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed."
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:27.920]   So, you may want to underline that statement and just put a number one next to that. That
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:34.560]   is the first way there is a relationship between Adam and myself. There is imputed guilt,
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:45.920]   and then secondly, there is imparted corruption going on in that statement, and the same death
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.920]   in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:29:01.440]   generation. So, there is a nature that is imparted in addition to the guilt that is imputed.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:10.240]   So, let me deal with the first aspect very briefly, but I want you to understand this concept
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   because I think this is going to give us a fuller, clearer teaching on sin and help us
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:24.560]   to understand the grace of God. What is imputed guilt, imputed guilt? Now, a lot of people
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.240]   don't like this whole idea of imputed guilt. They say, "You know, it's not fair.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:37.840]   What do you mean that Adam sinned and somehow that guilt was imputed to my account?
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.960]   That's not fair. I mean, I wasn't there in the garden. It's not my fault that Adam sinned.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:51.760]   How am I held responsible for Adam's guilt?" And the way I kind of respond to that is just by
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:59.840]   showing them the three imputations in the Bible. The concept of imputation is very important to
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.360]   our understanding of salvation and our understanding of the grace of God. You see there,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:11.200]   and I start here conceptually on the right-hand side just to show you the reasoning
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.640]   of how people like the first two imputations, but they really don't like the third.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:26.160]   The first imputation is that my sins were imputed to Christ at the cross. When Jesus died on the
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:34.320]   cross, Jesus took the penalty for my sins. God treated Christ as if he had sinned every single
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:43.760]   one of my sins, and he reckoned or imputed all the guilt of my sin to Jesus, my perfect substitute.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.480]   And if you're a believer in Christ, you say, "Well, I love that imputation. That's a
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.640]   that's a imputation that communicates God's grace to me that Jesus paid for all of my sins."
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:03.040]   The second imputation, and you can look at 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 for this idea of double
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:10.160]   imputation, was not only my sin nailed to the cross with Jesus, but Christ's righteousness
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:18.640]   was granted to my account at the moment I believed in Christ for salvation. God took my
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:29.120]   sinful record of guilt and nailed it to the cross with Christ. Then God takes Christ's spotless
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:36.480]   record of perfect obedience to the holy law of God. He takes his perfect record of perfect law
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:45.760]   keeping, and he imputes it to my account when I trust in him for salvation, and that's amazing
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:52.000]   that's amazing grace. He who knew no sin became sin, that we might become the righteousness of
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.720]   God in him. So, those are double imputation that's found in scripture. So, every believer looks at
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.480]   those two imputations and says, "Amazing grace. I love the idea of imputation. I love the idea of
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   double imputation." Well, if you are going to embrace the concept of imputation in those first
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.320]   two imputations, then you have to be willing to embrace the third, and I know in terms of time,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.080]   the left-hand side goes first, but I'm just showing you how I reason from this
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:31.040]   when I get the objection that it's not fair that Adam's guilt is imputed to my account.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:37.360]   If you're going to take the first two imputations, then you have to be willing to take the third.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:48.000]   Somehow, when Adam sinned, his guilt was imputed to my account so that Romans 5 verse 12 says,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.600]   "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   and so death spread to all men because all sinned." Somehow, when Adam sinned, it was reckoned to my
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:08.400]   account so that God has considered that all those who came from Adam's line sinned as well.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:16.560]   Now, theologians walk through. It's way more than we can look at tonight in our study,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.000]   but theologians look at exactly how did that happen. Some take the federal headship view,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.480]   this idea of Adam was the federal head of the human race. It's like if the president
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:37.200]   of the United States says, "We're at war," then I'm at war, whether I like it or not,
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.400]   because he's the head of the country. I might say, "Well, I didn't go to war, but
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.840]   the president says we're at war, so I am at war as an individual because he represents
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:54.000]   me as the head of the country." There's the federal headship view. There's also the
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.400]   seminal view that all of man was seminally in Adam when he sinned, so all are considered to
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.200]   have sinned. If you want further study on that, you can look at that on your own,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.440]   but the idea is you can't deny the plain teaching of Romans 5 verse 12. Somehow, when Adam sinned,
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:20.320]   all were considered to have sinned, all sinned in Adam. That's the first way that
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:34.400]   our sin is related to Adam. The second way, as we saw, is not only is guilt imputed from Adam to us,
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.480]   but then original pollution, a corrupt nature is imparted from Adam to us. Now, this is going to
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:47.280]   lead us right into our essay. We're laying the groundwork here, so trust me, we're going right
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:55.600]   to the noetic effects of sin. This is where the noetic effects of sin come in. We have received
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:06.320]   a corrupt sinful nature because of Adam's sin, and it is from this corrupt nature that precedes
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:15.840]   actual sins. We are not sinners because we sin. We sin because we are sinners. We are simply
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:24.240]   expressing our nature that is derived from Adam. My children have not learned to sin merely by
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:31.040]   imitation. It's not that they just saw me complain about chicken and nuggets at McDonald's, and so
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:37.600]   they learned to complain about chicken and nuggets from McDonald's because they saw me sin,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:43.120]   and I never complained about chicken and nuggets from McDonald's. That's just an illustration,
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:50.000]   but they didn't learn to sin merely because of my example. They have inherited from me a sin nature.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:36:01.040]   Dogs reproduce dogs, and cats reproduce cats, and sinners beget sinners, and just as dogs bark
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:07.120]   and cats meow, sinners express their nature through actual sins. It's amazing. I didn't
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:13.040]   have to teach any of my children to complain. I never had to have a single lesson on how to fight
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.640]   or how to steal or how to lie. All those things came from their nature. I had to teach them
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   otherwise, and all that is because they received a sin nature from me, and that goes all the way
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:36.000]   back to Adam. So, here's where the essay question comes into focus. The extent of sin, and this is
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:45.600]   on the next page of your handout. Because we have received a sin nature from Adam,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.600]   then it follows that sin affects every part of man. Sin affects the will, the mind,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.320]   the emotions, the thoughts, the affections, the desires, the purposes, the inclinations,
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:06.720]   the values, and the treasures of the heart. Every part of man is affected by sin, and this would
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:19.760]   relate to the five points of Calvinism. I try not to wear that as a slogan, but more just as a
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:30.320]   summary of biblical truth. The T in tulip, total depravity, refers to the extent of our sinfulness,
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:37.280]   not the degree to which we manifest it. It means that evil has contaminated every aspect of our
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:44.960]   being. That's important. Sin affects our wills, our intellect, our emotions, our conscience,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.760]   our personality, and our desires. Our depravity is a heart corruption. In other words, it goes
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:56.480]   to the very core of who we are. We are infected by sin in every part of our souls.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:03.600]   So, tulip begins with total depravity. It could probably be better
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:14.400]   defined as radical depravity, but the acronym RULIP is not a great acronym. So,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.360]   we'll just go with total depravity, but it refers to the extent of our sinfulness,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:28.800]   not the degree to which we manifest sinfulness. Not every man manifests his sin nature to the
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   fullest degree that he could possibly do so, but total depravity means that evil has contaminated
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:43.360]   every aspect of our being and goes to the very core of who we are. So, a few points here,
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.680]   and then I'll make some application. Letter A, sin as internal heart corruption. Sin has affected
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.800]   the heart, the real you, the center of who you are. Genesis 6 verse 5, "The Lord saw the wickedness of
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.640]   man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:07.440]   evil continually." So, that's why I don't tell my children, "Follow your hearts."
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.680]   I tell them, "Follow the word. Follow Christ. Follow
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:19.200]   the Lord. Don't listen to yourself. Talk to yourself. Submit yourself to scripture."
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:27.600]   Letter B, we have sin as spiritual slavery and bondage. John 8 verse 34, "Jesus answered them,
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.560]   'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. Spiritual
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:41.120]   slavery implies an absolute inability to change one's own nature." So, people always bring up
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:51.440]   at this point, "Well, what about free will? Do you believe in free will?" And I do in the sense
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:58.240]   that I believe that a man can freely choose what is in accordance with his nature.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:09.280]   A dog can freely choose to bark, and a cat can freely choose to meow. A dog cannot freely choose
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:18.000]   to meow, because that is not in accordance with his nature. Man can freely choose what is in
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.200]   accordance with his nature, but his nature is sinful. He is infected to the core of his being
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:34.000]   with sin. Man is not free to choose what is contrary to his nature. So, man can freely choose
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.880]   to sin, but man cannot freely choose righteousness. He is a slave to sin. Martin Luther called this
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:49.760]   the bondage of the will, and it was really this whole discussion of the bondage of the will versus
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.520]   the freedom of the will that led to the rediscovery of the great doctrines of the reformation and
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:05.600]   justification by faith. Is man's will free, or is it in bondage? And scripture says that man is a
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:15.680]   slave to sin. Man can only freely choose to act what is in accordance with his sinful nature. And
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:22.720]   then we looked at our devotional sin of spiritual deadness, and you were dead in your trespasses and
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:30.720]   sins in which you once walked. Spiritual deadness implies an absolute inability to respond to
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:40.560]   spiritual things. God told Ezekiel in Ezekiel chapter 37 to preach the bones. He said there
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:49.680]   is a valley of bones, and he wanted Ezekiel to preach. I've always said that I preach to some
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.000]   tough audiences in my life, but I've never had this assignment. Go preach to a bunch of dead bones.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.440]   And Ezekiel 37 verse 5, "Thus says the Lord God to these bones, 'Behold, I will cause breath to
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.880]   enter you and you will live, and I will lay sinews upon you and will cause flesh to come upon you
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.600]   and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:22.320]   Lord.'" That's an illustration of the glory of salvation, regeneration. Ezekiel 37 is an
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:30.000]   illustration of the expressions of grace in the new covenant as explained in Ezekiel chapter 36.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.920]   In the new covenant provisions of salvation, God is going to take dead men and he is going to make
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:49.200]   them alive, and this is a beautiful illustration of new life. So the intellect is affected by sin,
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:56.080]   the conscience is affected by sin, the will of man is affected by sin, and really to our point,
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:05.120]   and all this was a lot of foundation, but to our point, Roman numeral number four,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:13.520]   we have the noetic effects of sin. The mind is infected by sin. So responding to this idea that
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.880]   says in order to help people with their problems, we need to integrate the tenets of secular
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:25.760]   psychology with the truth of scripture, which if I could just respond to that kind of bluntly,
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:32.640]   what you're saying then is that we need to take the teaching of spiritually dead sinners
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:43.840]   and integrate them with biblical truth that is taught by those who are spiritually alive in
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:55.440]   Christ. Would you want to combine spiritually alive teachers with those who are spiritually
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.360]   dead? That's kind of just a blunt way to respond to that. We'll get a little more nuanced in a
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:09.840]   moment, but this is the whole idea of sin has infected the mind of the unbeliever,
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:18.400]   and the intellect of the unbeliever is affected by sin. So how would we respond to this idea that
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.200]   we need to integrate secular psychology with the truth of scripture?
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:31.280]   Well, letter A, a few arguments, a few responses. We have to acknowledge that the unbeliever is
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:38.560]   not objective when it comes to the things of God. Colossians 1 verse 21, "And you who once
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:44.720]   were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds." I covered some of this last week. I'm not
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:52.240]   going to redo that teaching, but we're not saying that unbelievers are unintelligent. We're not
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.520]   saying that unbelievers aren't smart. We're saying that unbelievers will use their intellect to argue
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:09.440]   against the truth of God's word. And I showed you a diagram last week, which I'll redo this
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:16.400]   today in just a moment. But the Noahic effects of sin have their greatest
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.720]   impact on the subjects which are closest to the study of God.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:30.320]   I gave you George Sipioni's, the article, Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Moe, footnote 24,
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:38.400]   which says that as we move to left to right on the spectrum of intellectual disciplines,
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.880]   we move from the abstract non-personal to the concrete personal aspects of the universe.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:49.360]   As we move to the right, the noetic effects of sin are multiplied at an escalating pace,
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.160]   distorting the observation of data and the conclusions drawn from that data. The distortion
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.960]   grows as we move right until we find clearly rival theologies that openly self-consciously reject the
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:06.240]   true and the living God. So the closer you get to the study of God, the more you see the noetic
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:13.600]   effects of sin. You see the most distortion in the realm of psychology because man is made in
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.320]   the image of God and you cannot study man without understanding God. So that's a footnote that you
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:30.400]   would do well to study and understand for this essay. Heath Lambert says that geologists do not
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:35.920]   merely observe fossils. They make sense of those fossils by attempting to discern the time of their
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.440]   origin. Unbelieving geologists never trace fossils to a personal God from several thousand years ago,
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:48.880]   but to impersonal forces seven billion years ago. It is the same with secular psychologists. They
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.000]   press their observations through the grid of a fallen worldview and will inevitably
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   distort their observations with faulty interpretations. So he's building on those
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.520]   three aspects of psychology that are articulated in chapter three of
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.080]   Theology, Biblical Counseling, Observations, Interpretations, and Interventions.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:20.320]   And he's saying, look, a geologist at the level of observations would probably make the same
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:27.360]   observations that a believer would about fossils. They would say, well, it's this color
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:36.320]   or this size or here's the measurements. They would probably make similar observations about
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:46.080]   fossils. But an unbelieving geologist at the level of interpretation will trace the existence of
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:53.200]   fossils to impersonal forces several billion years ago and say it all is a result of evolution
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.320]   and it all came out of a big bang at some point. It's really at the level of interpretation that
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:08.320]   believers and unbelievers diverge in how they interpret information. And it's the same with
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.160]   secular psychology. He says the difference between psychology and geology is that the
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.280]   implications for the human race are much more severe in an atheistic interpretation of counseling
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:25.520]   people than with an atheistic interpretation of rock formations. The interpretations of secular
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:30.880]   psychologists affect troubled people where they live and experience problems. It is in these
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:37.840]   interpretations where we see the largest impact of the noetic effects of sin. So you can't just
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:45.680]   take a distorted view of man and then import it into a biblical worldview. Let me give you an
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.160]   illustration of this. You have there the three levels of psychology. This is found in chapter
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   three of Heath Lambert's work. You have observation, interpretation, intervention. We're saying that
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:02.800]   observation tends to be similar whether it's made by a believer or unbeliever.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:09.360]   The interpretation of that data is completely different. And an illustration of this would be
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   if you had a counselee who was struggling with anxiety. Well, both a secular psychologist and
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:25.440]   a biblical counselor would most likely make very similar observations about the counselee and how
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:32.960]   the counselee is behaving. They would probably both observe that the counselee has sweaty palms,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:40.480]   increased heart rate, heightened emotion, distracted thinking. They would most likely
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:48.560]   make similar observations about these anxious periods tend to occur at certain times of the day
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:56.000]   that there really would be a lot of commonality at the level of observation between a secular
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.280]   psychologist and a biblical counselor. It's at the level of interpretation. Why is the
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   counselee behaving in this way? That's where the two viewpoints diverge. At the level of
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.360]   interpretation, we would say that the counselee is a person who was made in the image of God,
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:23.440]   that the counselee is made to live in relationship with God and to worship God,
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:29.760]   to reflect God's glory, that it is out of the heart that flow the issues of life,
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.480]   that the heart is always relating to God either rightly or wrongly.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:42.720]   Biblically speaking, the heart has thoughts, desires, values. Most likely, these thoughts
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:50.960]   are unbiblical thoughts that are giving rise to anxious behaviors. Desires are rooted in what a
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:59.120]   person most values. Most likely, this counselee has strong desires that are not submitted to the
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:07.200]   will and to the plan of God. Those are all heart issues that relate to how is this person relating
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:14.960]   to God because the interpretation of that data would be completely different from a secular
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:22.880]   psychologist. A secular psychologist might say one viewpoint. There's so many different viewpoints
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.680]   within secular psychology, but one viewpoint in secular psychology would be the medical model,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:36.480]   which says it's all physiological. There must be a physical explanation for this kind of behavior,
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:44.400]   and that might relate to imbalances chemically in a person's brain or so forth and so on.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:54.560]   The intervention is to medicate. If you're with me in year one of biblical counseling,
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:02.400]   we are not anti-medication. There's no law in the Bible that says you cannot take
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:08.880]   anti-anxiety medication, but what the biblical counselor would do would seek to address the
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:14.400]   thoughts and intentions of the heart using scripture, scripture such as Matthew 6, verse 34,
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.640]   "Do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself."
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:26.160]   Philippians 4, verses 6 to 7, dealing with anxiety through thankful prayer and then
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.200]   training the counselee to address the issues of the heart through use of the word of God.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:39.040]   I give you this case study to just illustrate how observations can be similar, but interpretations
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   can be different, and your interventions are based on your interpretations. So, letter C,
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:54.480]   what's the good news? The good news is because of Christ, the believer can have a renewed mind. I
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.240]   mean, that theme is just found throughout all scripture. We could spend an hour talking about
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:05.680]   how the mind of the believer is renewed in Christ, how we've been given the mind of Christ,
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.120]   the noetic effects of sin are reversed in salvation, and the more we are sanctified,
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:17.760]   the more we take the truth of God's word and renew our minds, and this is the process of
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.640]   sanctification. 1 Corinthians 2, verse 12, "Now we have received not the spirit of the world,
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.040]   but the spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God."
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.200]   Verse 16, "For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him, but we have
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:40.320]   the mind of Christ." Ephesians 4, verse 17, talks about the futility of the unbeliever's mind.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.200]   Verse 18, "They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.360]   God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of heart." So,
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:55.040]   we would just ask the question, do you really want to take that intellectual system that is
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:03.920]   darkened in its understanding at the point of understanding who man is
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:14.960]   and then combine it with the mind of Christ? Will you come up with a hybrid that is useful?
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:21.760]   So, going back to our question, and I'll wrap it up in this way. The question is, "Explain the
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.400]   doctrine of the noetic effects of sin, relating the doctrine to the ability of the secular
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:32.240]   psychologist to understand true information about the human condition." I would hit three points in
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:39.600]   this essay. Number one, make sure you explain the corruption of the unbeliever's nature.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:47.520]   It's not just the mind that is affected by sin. It is the unbeliever's entire nature that has been
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:57.280]   inherited from Adam. Make sure that you articulate a robust doctrine of sin that affects
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:06.560]   mind, will, intellect, conscience, desires, and so forth and so on. And you would do well to take
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:12.080]   some time. Don't get lost. You don't need to do the whole explanation of the doctrine of original
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:17.680]   sin, but you would do well to take some time to explain how this all derives from its root, which
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:28.000]   is Adam. Number two, you want to hit the point that the unbeliever's mind is hostile. It's not
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:37.680]   neutral or unbiased. Work through the three levels of psychology. Secular psychologists can make
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.960]   accurate observations, but they will have flawed
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:54.640]   interpretations because their minds are hostile towards God. And then number three, you want to
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:56:02.880]   note that the interpretations of the data under secular psychology is going to be impacted by
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:11.360]   sin's effects. So the task of the biblical counselor is to renew the mind in Christ. We
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:18.480]   can address the issues of life because we have a renewed mind. We have the mind of Christ.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:25.120]   Just a practical word, in biblical counseling, what we are doing is we are seeking to help the
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:33.280]   counselee to renew their minds in the scriptures. Most times in counseling, there are unbiblical
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:40.080]   thoughts, unbiblical desires, unbiblical thought patterns that are opposed to the truth. And
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:45.280]   many times those thought patterns have been built up over time and rehearsed
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.480]   over many years. And we are seeking to help the counselee to renew their mind according to the
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:57.760]   scripture by getting them into the scripture and then using the word of God as a scalpel
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:04.000]   with precision to take every thought captive to Christ. And so this is a good
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.960]   session that will help us to equip us for that ministry. Okay. Well, what I'm going to do right
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.640]   now, I'm going to go ahead and pray for us and close this. And if you need to go,
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.760]   then you're welcome to go. I'll hang on for a few minutes. If any of you have any questions,
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:28.640]   I'll be happy to answer that on the chat or on Q&A. Otherwise, we do wish you a wonderful night
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:36.960]   and a great week rejoicing in the grace of God that God has saved us and given us a renewed
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.600]   mind. So let me pray for us and we'll officially bring this time to a close. Let me pray.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:47.840]   Father, thank you for your word and just for the grace that you've shown to us to make us alive in
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:56.640]   Christ, to give us a renewed mind or a new heart, a renewed spirit. We thank you that you took us
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:04.240]   when we were dead and you made us alive in Christ. And we thank you, Lord, that though we
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:11.040]   were once hostile in mind, and now Lord, we desire to use our minds to glorify you and to think your
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.800]   thoughts after you. We thank you for your word, which gives us a renewed mind, the mind of Christ.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:22.080]   We thank you for your spirit who teaches us your word. And we pray that you would give us a great
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:30.240]   week studying these truths. We pray that a fuller, clearer teaching about sin would lead to a fuller,
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:38.400]   clearer understanding of Christ and all that he has done to save us. And that we would love you
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:43.440]   as a result of this study. Thank you for each of my brothers and sisters here. Bless us as we go
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:52.880]   in Jesus' name. Amen. Okay, amen. Have a wonderful night. I'll hang on for a few minutes here. If you
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:59:04.080]   have any questions, I'll be happy to answer that for you.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:11.280]   So,
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:32.080]   okay, great question. There's one question that came in. Is there a difference between unbiblical
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:39.520]   thought patterns and habits and strongholds? The ACBC conference is destroying strongholds.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:53.680]   Great question. So, this is the ACBC theme for this year is destroying strongholds,
[00:59:53.680 --> 01:00:04.000]   and it is based off of 2 Corinthians chapter 10, verse 3. "For though we walk in the flesh,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.680]   we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh,
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.840]   but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:20.480]   and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:32.400]   thought captive to the obedience of Christ." I think that the inspiration for this conference
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:40.000]   came out of David Powelson's final work before he went to be with the Lord. I think it's published
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.760]   now. You can actually find David Powelson's final work on spiritual warfare, and he wrote that right
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:56.960]   before he went to be with the Lord, and he was really articulating this idea of spiritual warfare
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:04.000]   is taking every thought captive to Christ. It's really battling for the thoughts and
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.280]   the intentions of the heart, and the idea of fortresses here is there are in people's hearts
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.000]   thought patterns, as I mentioned, that have been so built up and fortified over time
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:29.840]   that really to demolish those fortresses takes a spiritual battle. I can relate to this of just,
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:38.480]   you know, my wife and I have talked about the battle against perfectionism, and that's a
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:47.840]   continued battle for me maybe built up over time where I was raised in a culture where grades were
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:56.160]   very important, very preeminent. I mean, if you brought home an A-minus, and this is not faulting
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:04.400]   my parents at all, and I'm very grateful actually for how they raised me, but there was a standard
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:12.960]   there where if it was an A-minus, why isn't it an A, and for me, for years, you know,
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:22.480]   your worth was defined as your grade or your standard of performance, and even in my own
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:30.240]   sanctification, that's not something that easily goes away to find that my worth is in Christ.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.360]   The fortress that I've been dealing with in my own life and over the years of being a Christian is
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:45.600]   the fortress of I am, my worth is in my performance. My worth is in my performance.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.880]   My worth is in my performance. That's a repeated refrain in my heart that has
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:59.360]   been built up over years, and it's become a stronghold where to move from that in sanctification
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.680]   to say my worth is in Christ. My worth is in His finished work. My worth is in what He has
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:14.160]   accomplished for me. That's a battle that by God's grace, I'm making progress, but it's not
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:21.920]   something that comes easily or immediately, and I think that's some of what Paul's saying here
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.200]   with taking every thought captive to Christ, that that's a spiritual battle, and I think that's what
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.400]   the ACBC conference is going to address, and by the way, if you're able to make it, please try to
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.120]   make it. I'm not sure what the plans are going to be. They are still planning to meet in person, but
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:44.560]   they might have an online session as well, a live stream, but it is a very important
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.720]   topic and one that's worthy of your careful consideration, and I encourage you to get David
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.560]   Powelson's, I'm forgetting the title, but if you go on Amazon and look up David Powelson,
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   I think it's spiritual warfare or something along those lines. That would be a worthy read for you
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:09.760]   to work through this whole idea of destroying strongholds, so wonderful question. Thanks for
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:16.960]   a great question there. Question is, it was mentioned that our spiritual deadness implies
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.440]   an inability to respond to spiritual things. How do you respond to someone who feels conviction
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.640]   and responds to teachings such as from a sermon, but they're not saved yet?
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:33.360]   Is this inability for actual understanding and application?
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:41.840]   So that's a great question. I'd have to understand specifically maybe the person
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:49.600]   a little bit better before I made a blanket statement. In general, if there is an unbeliever
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:05:01.120]   that is in my church and they are responding to teaching and even being convicted by that teaching,
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:08.560]   then I'm going to do everything in my power to take a very gracious and hopeful perspective on
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.240]   that and pray and trust that that is the Holy Spirit working on that unbeliever's heart.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:21.280]   I want to be very careful before I consider this person a brother. The person is not a brother in
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:27.520]   Christ until he confesses Jesus Christ as Lord, but if an unbeliever is in the midst of a church
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:34.400]   assembly and hearing the Word and hearing Bible teaching, I'm going to do everything to encourage
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.760]   that, to take the most hopeful view of that, to pray that, Lord willing, that is the work of the
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:48.960]   Holy Spirit softening that unbeliever's heart. And practically speaking, we do understand that
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:56.880]   theologically regeneration is instantaneous. It is the quickening work of the Holy Spirit
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:04.000]   where he makes an unbeliever alive in Christ, but practically what it looks like in many people's
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.960]   cases is a progressive softening over time. If you were asking about my testimony,
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:19.120]   I could probably point out a two to three week period that I believe it was somewhere in that
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:25.040]   period that I gave my life to Christ. I'm not totally sure. I can't pinpoint a date or a time.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:32.400]   There was no magic zap or there was no altar call that I came forward, but it was in some kind of,
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:39.600]   within a month, God was working in my life. Theologically, I know that there was a point
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:47.440]   in time where God gave me new life and made me to be a new creation, but experientially,
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:54.400]   I'm not sure when that point was. So we just want to be careful of that. And on a pastoral level,
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:00.240]   I would be encouraging that unbeliever to keep sitting under God's Word. I'm going to pray that
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.080]   God will do a work in your heart, but I wouldn't treat that person as a brother until they confess
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:13.680]   Jesus Christ as Lord. So it's a great question. Thank you for that question. It's encouraging
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:22.960]   to see that you're thinking that through. One question is, would you nuance how to difference
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.440]   between answering the noetic effects of sin versus common grace? Great question. So
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:35.360]   my short answer is read chapter three of A Theology of Biblical Counseling
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:48.000]   by Heath Lambert. The two essays overlap. There is a place where one ends and the other begins.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.800]   One practical tip is you can always in your essay say you stated something in a previous essay and
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:03.200]   you want to use that material again in a new essay. You can actually in the new essay say,
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:12.080]   as previously discussed in essay number five, common grace does not
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.320]   overcome the noetic effects of sin. And you can actually use some of the same material twice
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:26.960]   where the essay topics overlap. So just be aware that you can do that. And in these cases,
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.520]   theology exam number five and theology exam number six do overlap. Generally speaking,
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:40.000]   the first half of chapter three in Heath Lambert's work deals with common grace. But the whole point
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.560]   of that presentation is to state that common grace does not overcome the noetic effects of sin. And
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:54.240]   then there's a discussion on the second half on the noetic effects of sin. So it's a great question
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:00.240]   and thank you for asking it, but there is an overlap. And so there might be some overlap in
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.520]   these two essays on how you write it, but you can use that technique if you need to repeat some
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:13.520]   material. Just say, as previously discussed, and you can overlap in some of that material.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:19.600]   Not all of the essay can be an overlap, but some of it can be. So wonderful question.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:28.960]   The question is, I think it's a similar question. With the last question,
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.280]   I focused on the common grace relating to knowledge and about half of it is on the
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:39.280]   noetic effects of sin's effect on knowledge. This new question feels almost the same. Should
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.520]   I redo the last question or really focus on the doctrine of sin on this one?
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:55.040]   Yeah, as I mentioned, a great question. There are some overlaps, but question number five,
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.200]   you probably want to spend the bulk of that essay discussing common grace
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:07.920]   and distinguishing that between saving grace. And you should be spending a majority of that
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:15.760]   discussing what is common grace? What does common grace allow the unbeliever to do?
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   And then at the ends of that essay, moving toward the limitations of common grace.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:32.800]   And there will be some overlap, but the focus of essay number six, most of it should be focused on
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:39.920]   doctrine of sin, inherited sin nature, the extent of sin and how sin affects
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:48.880]   every part of man, and then how that relates to the secular psychologist, assuming that
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.880]   the secular psychologist is an unbeliever, how does that impact their understanding of man?
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:02.160]   I remember sitting with Dale Johnson, who was the executive director of ACBC,
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.360]   and he was sharing how in his undergraduate studies, he studied secular psychology,
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:13.040]   he was a psychology major. And then at some point as a Christian, he came to
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:20.000]   the conviction that secular psychology presents a different doctrine of man than the Bible does.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   And that for him led him into the ministry of biblical counseling. It really is centered on
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   the doctrine of man, who is man. And so can an unbeliever who does not have the truth of God's
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.320]   word, and who is dead in sins and trespasses, understand the truth of who man is apart from
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:51.120]   the revelation of God? That's really more the focus of theology exam number six. So there is
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:57.280]   some overlap, but focus in on common grace on essay number five, and focus on the doctrine of
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:10.320]   sin in essay number six. Wonderful question. Okay. Well, wonderful. Thank you so much for
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.080]   joining us tonight. I hope that you were blessed and hope that you'll have a great and a wonderful
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:22.880]   week, and have a blessed week in the Lord. We'll see you next Sunday. We'll look at theology exam
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:37.520]   number seven next Sunday at five o'clock, and I'll see you next week. God bless you guys.
