[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Happy Friday everyone. We close out the week with a question from our email inbox.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   "Pastor John, I'm a mother of three sweet girls and my husband and I love them dearly.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   We are expecting our fourth child. We live in India where a boy is preferred over a girl.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Many Christians around us tell us they are praying for us to have a boy now.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   One pastor whom we know tells us the story that he once went up for a whole night
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   on a mountain to pray for a son and he later received a son.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   We do value a girl the same as a boy. My husband feels that it is special to have a boy also,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   someone who carries on our family line. And in the Bible, a male was prayed for and given, like Samuel.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   But is it right to prefer and ask God for a specific gender or should we simply trust in God's sovereignty
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and goodness to give us what he thinks is right for us? Or should we be persistent in our prayers for a boy?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And finally, in the Bible, is there a special blessing or inheritance for a boy which a girl cannot have?"
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Well, I hear two distinct and really good questions.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Number one, is there a biblical basis for some kind of special blessing or inheritance for a boy that a girl can't have?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   That's number one. Number two, is it right to prefer or to ask God for a boy or a girl at any given time?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   So let me take the first one first because I think it's by far the most foundationally important.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And that's what I want to do is lay some foundations because, of course, there's just huge murderous effects
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   of preferring boys over girls around the world because of the way abortion is used to get rid of girls and so on.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So we as Christians need to deeply, profoundly, biblically establish the destiny and the origin and the worth of womanhood.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Okay, so I'm going to go there, even though it may be a little deeper than this question was asking.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Let me start with Genesis where everybody would expect me to start.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   "God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him. Male and female, he created them."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So there was an original harmony as both man and woman enjoyed God's favor and the extraordinary privilege of being in the very image of our Creator.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And in that peaceful pre-fall condition, there was a harmony of complementary roles, which then in the fall was ruined.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   The image was not destroyed, but it was damaged.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And part of the damage of that image is how our roles with one another are so conflicted today
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   that it's very hard to find our bearings in relation to one another now that sin has entered into the heart of every woman and every man.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Here comes a second crucial text about the place and the destiny and the dignity of woman.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   This is from 1 Peter 3.7.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   "Husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel."
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That's not a value judgment there. That's just a statement of fact. Physically weaker.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   "Since you are fellow heirs of the grace of life."
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's astonishing.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And in 1 Peter, the term "grace" is clear what that means, and "life" is eternal.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   This is the grace of inheriting eternal life, and the stress in that culture, which is probably more shocking than ours,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   is that you live, man, Mr. Husband, you live with a woman who's destined to inherit the world,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   because that's what you're promised in Christ.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   She will be a queen of the universe, and you sleep in the same bed with this stunning being.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So wake up to the reality of what you're dealing with here.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   That's why he says it that way, I think.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And then there's one more, and this one's really surprising to people,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   the way Paul underlines the equal inheritance of woman and man,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   because it's right in a place where they think he's doing the opposite.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   So this is Galatians 3, and he says, "In Christ," I think this is verse 26, following,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   "In Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Now a lot of people, a lot of women get their back up here.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Like, "Whoa, hey, you're leaving me out, because you're saying 'sons' instead of 'sons and daughters.'"
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Get this, when Paul says to the women in Galatia, "You are all sons of God,"
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   what he's saying is, "Sons in that culture, in many places today,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   had the right of primogeniture or the privilege of inheriting, and the daughters didn't.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm telling you, you are sons."
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Get this, women? I'm telling you, you are sons of God.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You will inherit the way a son inherits from a father.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   If we cave on this translation issue here and translate that "sons and daughters,"
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   it loses its very power to say to the women, "You are equal to a son.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   When I call you a son, I'm saying that you will inherit."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And so he goes on like this, "For as many of you," men and women,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   "are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, for you're all one in Christ.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And if you are Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring and heirs,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   because you're all sons according to the promise."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So women inherit the promises of Abraham as sons as much as men do as sons.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   That's the biblical starting point.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   There are differences, of course, in what daughters and sons will do in life.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   She will be able to bear children. The son won't be able to bear children,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   so that's a blessing that she has that he won't have.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   He will be able to father children and lead a wife and family that she won't be able to do as a woman.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   There are differences in what you can be and do because of sexuality,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   but the massive important issue is that men and women have a common heritage
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   in the image of God and in worth before God and in the destiny of inheritance from God.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Now the question is, can you pray for the one or the other?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Should you even prefer one or the other?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And I very much appreciate the question because I think everybody who has children has to ask this.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And they do ask it, whether they even say it out loud or not,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   because you're wondering, "What are we going to have and what would you like to have?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And should I ask God to influence that process?"
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And when you get two girls, should you ask for a boy?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And we had four boys, should we ask for a girl?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Or we had a boy, should we ask for a girl and then another asked for a girl
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   and then another asked for a girl and another, or should we not?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So here's my answer. There are dangers and there are warrants for praying this way.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   The dangers are, just to mention a couple, you might pray for a son or a daughter for wrong reasons.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   It would be wrong to pray for one sex because you failed to value the other one in a biblical way.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   That would be wrong, and that's true around the world for a lot of people.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It would be wrong to pray for one or the other for merely earthly or selfish reasons,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   like, "I need more help in the kitchen, for goodness sakes," or, "We need more help on the farm,"
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   or I just think those kinds of merely—and the word there is "merely" is important—
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   merely selfish, earthly reasons would be wrong.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And so we have to guard. If we're going to pray, better pray really carefully.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And a second danger is the wounds that could come to a child if the child felt, "I wasn't wanted.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   They wanted a girl and I'm a boy," or, "They wanted a boy and I'm a girl."
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   That's a danger that every parent needs to be very, very alerted to.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But there are not only dangers, there are warrants.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I think it is a God-given good desire for a mother to have a unique kind of desire for a daughter
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   and a father to have a unique kind of desire for a son.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And part of that is they both want, and rightly want, to build into this child
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   something of what God has made them to be as they've learned how to be a woman or a man.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   A woman has spent her whole life learning what it means to be a godly woman.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   She would love, she would love to build that into a little girl who grows up to be a godly woman.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And a man has spent his whole life trying to figure out what it means to be a man for God.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And he'd love to build that into a son.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Those are good desires, and to want the one or both is not wrong.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   A second warrant would be there may be some settings in life, in missions or in unique hardship,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   of a genetic danger.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Say if you knew a girl had a unique genetic proclivity that the boy wouldn't have
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   or something along those lines that you might say to God,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   "I would ask that you'd give me a son or a daughter."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   So my conclusion is test your motives by the scriptures
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and ask God according to your heart's desire
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and make clear to God, to your spouse, and to all the children,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   we will love God's gift to us.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Disabled or abled, male or female, living long or living short,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   we will love God's gift to us with all our heart,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and we will believe that God knows best.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Beautifully said, Pastor John. Thank you.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   We're starting to get a lot of questions from our global audience in Europe, India, Australia, and Japan,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   which is wonderful.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   In fact, we have an email question on Monday from a listener named Pradeep in India.
