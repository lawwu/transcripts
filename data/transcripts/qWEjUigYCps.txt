[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   In episode 27 we talked about pastoring through dry seasons, and Pastor John, as a
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.600]   pastor, how did you deal with seasons when you did not feel joy in God, and yet
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.200]   you were preparing to enter the pulpit and preach to your people about joy in
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.040]   God? Did you ever feel the need to disclose your personal condition in
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.520]   those sermons, or did you just preach confidently knowing that it's God's
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.480]   ever-relevant Word? How did you approach the pulpit in spiritually dry seasons?
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.000]   The principle I would use, then I'll tell you the actuality, the principle I would
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.440]   use is be real with your people. Don't fake it. Don't ever fake it. They'll see
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.680]   through that pretty quick, and your own conscience will condemn you. That
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.360]   doesn't mean that you always need to say every hard thing you've dealt with
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.240]   during the week. It just may mean you need to say, "There was a text appointed
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.120]   for today, and I wasn't able to do it," or "This text is appointed for today. I want
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.760]   you to know I don't feel the fullness of this text, but I'm going to tell you what
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.120]   this text says, and you pray for me, and I'll pray for you." You can say things like
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.440]   that, but my experience, Tony, is simply astonishing. In all the depression,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.400]   discouragement, and blankness that I have felt over the years, the Lord has always
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.360]   lifted it enough so that as I've gotten ready for Sunday, I've loved what I'm
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.200]   about to say. It's just uncanny how on Thursday--I used to take Thursdays off,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.600]   and some of those Thursdays off were just the lowest days. They were just low days, and I
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.720]   remember saying in Desiring God, I would sit in Nokomis Park on the grass, and I
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.480]   couldn't even remember my kids' names. I was so discouraged. And by Sunday morning,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.600]   I was able to love what I was saying and say it. So God has simply been very
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.320]   good to me in terms of the cycles of my struggles. So if a pastor is not feeling
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.160]   joy in God, he's not delighting in God and his preparations, you say just press
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.120]   in, keep pressing into the text, don't give up? Yes. I mean, there are more things
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   that you can do. There are 15 things at least that I mentioned. He may need to
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.880]   get up from his desk, close his books, and take a long walk by a lake. That's maybe
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.960]   what he needs to do. Or he may need to get on the phone and apologize for a sin
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.400]   he committed, or he may need to get a good night's sleep. I mean, there's just
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.960]   lots of things. If I were to be a spiritual counselor for some wounded
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.640]   pastor, I wouldn't just say, "Read your Bible more, keep your nose in the text." I
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.280]   would probe into this man's life and look at him as a body and a soul and a
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.120]   spirit and try to discern all the factors that might be going into making
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.640]   him depressed or discouraged. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening
