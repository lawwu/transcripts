[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.240]   All right, enough about that.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.600]   Let's see what we got here.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.640]   We got a question from Abby.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.360]   Abby says, how do you motivate unmotivated students
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960]   to get to deep work?
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800]   Abby says, I find my work to be of Sisyphus.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800]   So maybe she means like Sisyphean.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.080]   I teach high school chemistry.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.480]   We do lots of labs and discuss and construct concepts.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.120]   Dot, dot, dot.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.920]   However, since I started teaching five years ago,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.840]   students have become less motivated and gross
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.400]   in their social media lives.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.320]   Parentheses, I hate the phone.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.200]   I want them to have a glimpse of the deep life
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.120]   and aspire to exercise and build their brains.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.880]   Where do I start?
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.720]   Every day is the same thing.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.680]   They do not pay attention.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.200]   So they either do not grasp anything
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.080]   or forget immediately how they are the future of humanity.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.400]   Abby, I feel your pain.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.680]   And you're not going to be able to directly solve
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080]   this problem like you are in these kids'
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.240]   lives for a period each day.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.520]   But demonstrate the change you want to see in the world.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.840]   We were talking about this in the last answer as well.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.800]   Discuss concentration, mental difficulty.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.600]   I'm willing to stick with something hard
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   even when it gets difficult and stick with it.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.480]   Discuss that as a tier one skill.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.640]   This is how these breakthroughs in chemistry happen.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.720]   This is how athletes become fantastic athletes.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.880]   This is how those movies you love are made.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.760]   This is how The Rock molded his body and his character
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.000]   into being a international superstar.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Focusing on things when it's hard,
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.280]   keeping your attention on one thing,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.120]   persisting through difficulty.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.320]   Just giving this message, emphasizing this message,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.720]   giving examples of this message, that does sink in.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.080]   It doesn't mean it's going to change people right away.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.160]   It doesn't mean you can get them off their phones.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.360]   A lot more has to be involved in getting that done.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.080]   But you lay down the vision of what the alternative could be.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.280]   You cannot escape from the trap of the shallows
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.720]   until the attraction of the depths
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.360]   is something that's even on your radar.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000]   And so that's one thing you could be doing.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.840]   And there are schools, including some schools around here,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.360]   who, for example, teach deep work.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.880]   And there are schools that teach my book, Digital Minimalism.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.040]   Like, there are schools that go at this straight on.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.040]   Like, we want to give you a specific frame
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160]   for thinking about these type of things.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.960]   Otherwise, what's the model they have?
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.840]   It's like, well, if I'm on this phone a lot,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.760]   maybe I'll be an influencer.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.160]   That's the only model they have.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.800]   And TikTok is tricking them into thinking
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.960]   that they're just one video away from that
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.520]   because it's giving them these fake view bursts.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.360]   So you got to give them the alternative.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.320]   The deep life, a life built on focusing
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   on hard but meaningful things,
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.200]   staying diligent on that, being resistant to distractions.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   This is a very attractive, cool thing.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.680]   'Cause basically everyone out there who's really interesting
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.520]   that we admire almost always is doing that.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.440]   And when that message gets through, you've planted the seed.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.680]   And you might not be able to grow that seed
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.760]   tomorrow in your class, but those seeds have to be planted
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.320]   if they're ever going to grow.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.820]   (upbeat music)
