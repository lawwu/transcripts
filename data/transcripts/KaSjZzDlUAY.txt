[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   Last Wednesday in episode number 411, we talked about God's moral will, how we come to know
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   what God wants us to do in various ethical situations, and in situations when we must
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.960]   decide like who to marry, what car to buy, and in what vocation to pursue.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.600]   But there's another dimension to God's will, another will altogether of God's ultimate
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.640]   sovereign will over every event in this world, and including His will over the evils of the
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.920]   cross.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.080]   The following sermon excerpt is taken from the sermon "What is the Will of God and How
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.080]   Do We Know It?"
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:46.560]   It's really crucial that we understand this difference between two meanings for the phrase
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.000]   the will of God.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.720]   Understanding the difference between these two kinds of the will of God in the Bible
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.080]   will be a key to unlock one of the biggest mysteries or the biggest perplexities in the
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:11.280]   Bible, namely that God is absolutely sovereign over all things and disapproves of many of
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.280]   them.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.680]   That's a very puzzling paradox.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.240]   God governs and controls all that is and manifestly in the Bible hates much of what happens.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.680]   That's an insoluble and I think contradictory situation unless the term the will of God
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.000]   in the Bible has more than one meaning, which it clearly does, and you'll be able to see
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.200]   it as I just take you to the various texts.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:54.880]   So we want to handle on how to manage this paradox or mystery that God forbids things
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.040]   He brings about and God commands things that He hinders from happening.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.560]   That in one sense something is the will of God and in another sense that same something
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.840]   is not the will of God.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   Without this category of thought, I don't think you can make sense out of the Bible.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.320]   The God of the Bible.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.920]   So let's look at these two kinds of willing.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.440]   Here's number one.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.560]   Let's call it either the sovereign will of God or His will of decree.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.840]   It means God's sovereign control of everything that comes to pass.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.800]   It's one of the clearest teachings of the Bible.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.520]   Let's look at some verses.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.320]   You know them, most of them.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.000]   Matthew 26, 39, Jesus is in Gethsemane and he prays like this, Father.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.360]   If it is possible, let this cup pass from me.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.920]   Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.240]   Matthew 26, 39.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.120]   What does as you will mean?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.960]   What kind of will of God is that?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.280]   Well, it means his plan for Jesus to be crucified.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.720]   If there is no other way, Father, if that is the infinitely wise way, the infinitely
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.920]   loving way, the infinitely just way, do what you must do.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.920]   And he did it.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.240]   And here's the crucial thing to observe.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.480]   It was shot through with sin and could not have happened without sin.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.600]   It's a sin to kill the Son of God.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.800]   It's a sin to mock the Son of God.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.560]   It's a sin to whip the Son of God with stripes prophesied in the Old Testament.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.040]   It's a sin to be expedient and wash your hands and hand him over.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.360]   And yet, we all know from Acts chapter 4, verse 27, "Truly in this city they were gathered
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.520]   together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.040]   along with the Gentiles and peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.320]   predestined to take place."
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.800]   The script was written for this night and this Good Friday in Isaiah 53 in great detail
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.440]   and in Psalm 22 and in many other passages.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.000]   The script was written.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.280]   The will of God is a fixed, determinate purpose to bring about the death of his Son, Isaiah
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.720]   53.10.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.360]   It was the will of the Lord to bruise him and it was full of sin, which means we must
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:56.240]   have a category of thinking that says God can ordain that sin happen without being a
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240]   sinner.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.160]   If you don't have that category in your mind, you can't handle the cross and the prophecies.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.440]   God ordains that there be sin in the particulars of the death of his Son because he couldn't
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.040]   have been crucified without it, and he is not himself a sinner in ordaining that sin
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   be.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040]   Amen.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.760]   We have over 1,200 John Piper sermons in our website, DesiringGod.org, but none of them
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   are more popular than this one.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.560]   It's titled "What is the Will of God and How Do We Know It?"
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   Preached on August 22, 2004.

[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.160]   Well, does God delight in other Christians more than he delights in me?
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.640]   Pastor John says sometimes the answer to that question is yes, and he'll explain why tomorrow.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.160]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.280]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
