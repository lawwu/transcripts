[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   "Can I forgive someone who does not confess to wronging me?"
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.080]   It's a question from Jason who writes, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.320]   As you know in Matthew 18, the parable of the unforgiving servant ends with a dire warning
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680]   to those who don't forgive.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.520]   So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.560]   from your heart."
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.000]   That's Matthew 18, 35.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.600]   In anger, his master delivered him to the jailers until he should pay all his debts.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.480]   That's Matthew 18, 34.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.800]   I have a lot of questions about this passage, but the main two are one, can I biblically
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.520]   forgive someone if they don't ask to be forgiven?
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440]   Or can I just be disposed or willing to forgive them if and when they ask?
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.920]   What if I or they die before I can forgive them?
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.600]   And the second question is, can I biblically forgive someone if they think they've done
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.680]   nothing wrong to me?
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.720]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jason?
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600]   Right.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.960]   So I hear at least three questions.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.280]   Can we forgive a person who doesn't think they've done wrong and we think they have?
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.520]   That's really relevant to marriage, by the way.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.960]   I think that happens a lot in marriage.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.040]   Another one that he asks, it seems, is if they don't ask for forgiveness, can forgiveness
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.280]   proceed?
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.680]   And then lastly, what if I die before I forgive them or they ask?
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:52.080]   So let's start with Jesus teaching about forgiveness, because it really is as important as Jason
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.560]   shows it to be.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.360]   Here's what Jesus says.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.440]   He says to pray like this, "Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors."
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.960]   And then he unpacks it.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.480]   That's Matthew 6, verse 12, I think.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.920]   And then he unpacks it in verse 14, "For if you forgive others their trespasses, your
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.760]   heavenly Father will forgive you.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.320]   But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.040]   That's huge.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.840]   And then Jesus puts it in a parable, which is what our friend is referring to in Matthew
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.520]   18.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.560]   Peter had just asked the Lord, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me and I
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560]   forgive him?
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.360]   As many as seven times?"
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880]   And Jesus said to him, "I do not say seven times, but seventy-seven times," or seven
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   times seventy.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.480]   Some translations have it.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.100]   Anyway, lots and lots and lots of times.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.720]   Then comes the parable, and a king forgives a debtor who owes him a million, million dollars.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.480]   It's just an off-the-charts number.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.240]   And then he goes out and strangles a friend who owes him ten dollars.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:19.280]   In other words, being forgiven has had zero transforming effect on this servant.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.600]   He's as selfish as ever.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.240]   And the king hears about it, and that's where we pick it up.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.360]   Then his master summoned him and said to him, "You wicked servant, I forgave you all that
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.200]   debt because you pleaded with me, and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.480]   as I had mercy on you?"
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.720]   And in anger, his master delivered him to the jailers until he should pay all his debt.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.320]   So also, my Heavenly Father will do to every one of you, you'll get thrown into prison
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.840]   if you do not forgive your brother from the heart.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.320]   And then James says the same thing, basically, in James 2.13 where he writes, "For judgment
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.040]   is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy."
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.840]   Mercy triumphs over judgment.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.520]   That means my mercy towards you, Tony, will be a triumphant influence at the judgment
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.840]   day.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.280]   Which is what Jesus said in Matthew 5, 7, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.560]   receive mercy."
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   If you're a merciless person, you meet a merciless God.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.780]   So from all this, we are sobered to realize that no one is a true Christian.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.760]   No one is born again and destined for heaven who is an ungrateful, unforgiving person.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:00.080]   Jesus would say, "You cannot genuinely receive my forgiveness and remain unforgiving.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.760]   You can't."
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:11.560]   Now Jason's question is—and they're clearly important, it's a matter of life and death.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.680]   First, what if I die—let's take them in that order—what if I die before I forgive
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.700]   my adversary?
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:30.040]   Now the answer to that hangs on the way you see your forgiveness functioning—that is,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.820]   your forgiving others—functioning in your final salvation.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:45.080]   If you think that God looks at each deed of your forgiving and repays it with salvation,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.520]   and if it's missing when you die, you would lose your salvation.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.600]   That's the way you conceive about it.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:04.440]   But if you think that the deed of your forgiving is one of the fruits of your union with Christ,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:16.160]   then if one of your fruits had not yet ripened into an act of forgiving, it would not necessarily
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.440]   prove that you're not united to Christ for two reasons.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.400]   First, because there are other fruits to show the reality of your union with Christ, and
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:41.560]   second, because the Lord himself could see—he could see the seed of your act, even if you
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:50.480]   did not have time for the seed of forgiveness to grow into the deed of forgiving.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.360]   So that is, in fact, I think, how it works.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:05.860]   That's the way the final experience of salvation relates to our being forgiving people.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.120]   Salvation is not payback for good works.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:18.880]   The good works are the fruit of union with Christ, who is the all-sufficient ground of
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:28.760]   our acceptance with God, so one good deed left undone is not a proof of our lostness.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.540]   It will be covered by the blood of Jesus because of our union with him through faith.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.560]   And all of our other acts of forgiveness in our life are testifying to that reality, that
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.380]   we've believed on him and his blood is covering us.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.580]   Which brings us now to Jason's other question.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:54.060]   Can we forgive a person who doesn't think he's done wrong, and we think he has, or
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.120]   if he doesn't ask for any forgiveness?
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.600]   And the answer is, we can.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.420]   And we must.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.060]   We must do our part in the forgiveness.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.680]   This is what Jesus meant, I think, when he said, "Love your enemies, bless those who
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.820]   curse you, pray for those who abuse you," Luke 6:27.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.960]   They are still our enemies when we do that.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.440]   They have not asked for any forgiveness, and they don't think they need any.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.460]   They're making life miserable for us, and they think they ought to.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:41.160]   We are to bless them, and that blessing means that our part of the inward forgiveness has
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.280]   happened.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.700]   The opposite of forgiveness is holding a grudge, but blessing is the opposite of holding a
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.200]   grudge, and so blessing is a kind of forgiving.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.600]   It is true, and I suppose this is what he's thinking, it is true that the full effect
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.460]   of forgiveness can only happen if the other person believes they need it and want it.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.280]   That's why it's so frustrating when you want to forgive somebody and they don't think they
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.880]   need any forgiveness.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.380]   But we do not wait for that, right?
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.080]   We don't wait for them to do their half before we do our half.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.240]   We must be rid of bitterness and grudges right away.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.600]   We do what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:38.800]   And 1 Peter described so powerfully, 1 Peter 2.23, "When he was reviled," so this is like
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.240]   he's setting an example for us, "when he was reviled, he did not revile in return, and
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.640]   when he suffered, he did not threaten."
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.520]   In fact, he prayed for their forgiveness.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:56.280]   But here's what it says, "But he continued entrusting himself to the one who judges justly."
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:05.220]   We must renounce revenge and trust our cause to God and then return good for evil.
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:14.440]   That's our part of forgiveness, and we can do it whether the adversary admits wrong or
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.000]   not.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.660]   One great miracle has already happened in us, and we're not responsible for the other
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.800]   miracle of repentance in them.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.320]   Yeah, may that miracle of humble repentance and confession become more and more real in
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.600]   our lives and marriages.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
