[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   We are recording this episode of Ask Pastor John at the very end of March, and
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.840]   you've been a pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church in the Twin Cities now for nearly
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.960]   33 years, and on Sunday of this week you will preach for the final time as a
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.040]   pastor. And your final sermon falls on Easter. What's going on in your mind
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.800]   right now as you think ahead to this capstone sermon? Well, the irony of that
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.840]   question, Tony, is that it's Thursday of Holy Week, and I will preach on Easter,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.240]   and I will start preparing my sermon tomorrow. And I'm laboring like crazy to
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.020]   get ready for the Gospel Coalition right now, and to get ready for my Maundy
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.420]   Thursday talk tonight. But I have chosen my text from Hebrews 13, 20, and 21, and I
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.720]   do have an idea where I wanted to go. That's why I chose the text, and so I can
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.180]   say a word about what I'm thinking, though how I'm going to say it, what I'm
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.400]   going to say, it's not read in any detail at all. I chose that text because it's
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.840]   Easter, number one, and it begins, "Now may the God of peace who brought again from
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.880]   the dead, our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep." So I chose it
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.720]   first because God brought again from the dead our Shepherd, but I chose it
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.080]   also because I'm a shepherd and I'm leaving my flock. And I want to say to
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.720]   them, "You have a great Shepherd." Jason Meyer and John Piper are both going to be
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:44.800]   dead someday, and you cannot put your final hope in any man, but you have a
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.200]   great Shepherd. I just love that phrase, "great Shepherd." He brought again from the
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.560]   dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep. He knows there's a lot of
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.440]   sub-shepherds. Us pitty little, sinful, fallible, failing sub-shepherds that
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.360]   cause all kinds of trouble in the Church, as well as bring some blessing to the
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.320]   Church. People have a shepherd, and he has been raised from the dead. He's the
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.640]   same yesterday, today, and forever, wherever they are in the world, whatever
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.240]   their circumstances, whatever people have failed them, whatever disappointments
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.560]   they have in the Church, they have a great Shepherd, and he is alive on Easter
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.840]   and forever, and therefore John Piper can go, Jason Meyer can go, Jesus will never
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.920]   ever go. That's the gist of what I want to say. Wonderful. And one of your
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.120]   heroes in the faith, Jonathan Edwards, who pastored in Northampton for 24 years, he
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.520]   preached a farewell sermon as well, under much different circumstances, of course.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.320]   Are you taking any cues from him on how to do this? I'm not looking to
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.200]   Edwards for clues for how to do this, because our situations are so, so
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.940]   different. But now that you've mentioned it, I might go look at it. Well, I said to
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.440]   Noel, one of the great ironies of this last week is that almost all my
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.680]   attention and all my energy is thinking beyond Easter. And I wish
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.880]   that weren't true, in a way. I wish I weren't under such pressure to get ready
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.240]   for what's coming in the week after Easter, so that I could sit here and
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.880]   savor more the ending of this 33 years. But in a way, Tony, I said to the
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.200]   Lord, you know, I don't know why you set it up this way, but in a way it feels
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.800]   very gratifying, because it feels like, okay, this is not a big cataclysmic end,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.440]   "Oh dear, what will I do on the 1st of April when I'm employed by Bethlehem?" It
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.680]   feels like I'm bouncing up and down on a diving board, and I'm ready to do a
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.000]   double-gainer into a new pool, and I just happen to have to preach at Bethlehem
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.520]   one more time in the process. So it's okay. I think the Lord will give me
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.840]   enough grace tomorrow, when I give myself wholly and emotionally and intellectually
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.320]   to framing that last sermon, that I will be able to savor this moment very deeply.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.560]   Well, it will be very exciting to see the splash you make in this new chapter of
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.600]   ministry. It looks to be a very busy one. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for
