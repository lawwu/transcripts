[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Communism is dumb and it has terrible, like sometimes decades long effects
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.720]   on institutional quality that I don't really quite understand.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.100]   So I'd say North Korea, if we had good data on North Korea, it would be even a
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.820]   bigger sort of deep root outlier than China is, don't have a communist
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.300]   dictatorship in your country seems to be pretty, a robust lesson
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.020]   for a national prosperity.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.140]   China's still stuck with a sort of crummy version of that mistake still.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.500]   North Korea, of course, is stuck with an even worse version.
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.740]   So I think that's, my hunch is that's the overwhelming issue there.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.560]   It's something that it's, China's stuck in an, currently China's stuck in an
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.740]   institutional cul-de-sac and they just don't quite know how to get out of it.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.840]   And it's bad for a lot of the people who live there on average.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.560]   If the other side had won the Chinese civil war, things would probably
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.040]   be a lot better off in China today.
