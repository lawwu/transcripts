[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940]   cold. Yeah. For reasons I still don't understand, people have associated me or this podcast with
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320]   deliberate cold exposure. I like deliberate cold exposure in the form of a cold shower or a cold
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.100]   plunge or an ice bath, mostly for the effects that occur afterward. Oh yeah. Yeah. And every
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.480]   time I do a post about deliberate cold exposure, I get asked, understandably so, how does it affect
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.800]   women differently than men? I prefer heat for women. Everyone's a responder to the heat. You get
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.220]   better adaptations. So sauna? Yep. Sauna. Hot tub? Yep. Preferably a true finished sauna. Infrared
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.720]   doesn't, it warms the skin, but not the core. Thank you for saying that. I'm not a big fan of
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.240]   infrared sauna because it doesn't get hot enough. No. Yeah. You can bring an infrared light into a
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.120]   traditional sauna if it can tolerate the heat. Yeah. So the thing with cold water exposure is
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.920]   the whole conversation about ice cold, ice baths and how cold it is. It's too cold for women because
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.100]   when we're looking at that severe immediate jump into that icy cold, it causes such severe constriction
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.480]   and shutdown. So women do really well and get that whole dopamine response and everything. If the water
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.340]   is around 16 degrees C, which is 55 to 56 degrees Fahrenheit. Which is chilly. It's chilly. It's not
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:33.120]   warm. No. It's go dive in San Francisco Bay, right? And that is enough to offset that severe constriction
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.360]   survival, but it is cold enough to invoke all the changes that we want with cold water exposure.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.560]   So it's a temperature nuance that sets sex difference. And like I said, when I have open
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.620]   water swimmers who are going to do a long swim or they're going to do a triathlon and the water is
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.820]   colder, I have them do cold water exposure, especially face exposure into the cold water to get them
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.780]   habituated to that initial severe constriction and sympathetic activity that we don't want to happen
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.180]   before a race. With heat being the true heat that we're talking about with sauna, we see a lot of
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.360]   metabolic changes for women. So we're having better insulin and glucose control. We're seeing a better
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.620]   expression of our heat shock proteins and the uncoupling and the rebuilding of those proteins that are
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:42.660]   cardiovascular responses. And then for women as we get older and have the offshoot of hot flashes,
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.800]   night sweats, that kind of stuff. If you're doing heat exposure, you're sending a stronger stimulus to
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.200]   the hypothalamus and you're also getting a better serotonin production from the gut because we have
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.880]   95% of our serotonin produced from the gut, which lends to better temperature control and shuts down
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.180]   hot flashes. So it's not that you disapprove of using deliberate cold exposure. You just recommend
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.180]   that women do deliberate cold exposure with temperatures that are maybe in the low 50 degree
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:27.660]   Fahrenheit range as opposed to the really, frankly, just painfully cold for anybody, 38 to 50 degree
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.140]   temperatures. I've been asked whether or not pregnant women can do deliberate cold exposure probably no
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:44.980]   fewer than 2,500 times on social media. And I never have an answer, but I always default to the cautious answer,
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.940]   which is, uh, please don't until you talk to somebody who actually has an answer. Yeah.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.880]   Just because it sounds like a very precarious situation, but in all honesty, I don't know.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.320]   I'm just biding time there and just saying, please go ask somebody who can give you a definitive answer.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.940]   Yeah. So we see women who have a high risk for miscarriage, that anything that they do that's
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:12.380]   incredibly stressful for the first 12 to 20 weeks will put them at a higher risk for it. So being very cautious,
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.220]   especially with cold, because we know that there are so many different nuances doing something like hot
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.220]   yoga when you're pregnant is not, there is research. So it's not detrimental because, yeah,
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.500]   because when we're looking at blood flow diversion that way, when you have slight hypoxia to the placenta
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:42.520]   and to the baby, there is a rebound effect that increases the vascularization so that the baby has better nutrients.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.340]   We see this also with like exercise and exercise intensities. This is why people are now saying you need to
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.020]   have some kind of blood flow change and increase in core temperature to create these vascular effects
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.620]   effects within the placenta to improve nutrient and nutrient delivery to the developing fetus. So
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.500]   heat's good. Cold, I'm not so sure of.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.880]   But probably not extreme heat.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.840]   Not extreme heat. So that's why I mean like hot yoga is not going to the sauna. Hot yoga sits around
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   40 degrees Celsius. So what is that? Just around 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.960]   And in that situation, if you're feeling too hot, you leave, you lie down on the floor, don't try to stay
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.200]   for the whole class. But it's not going to be detrimental unless you're pushing yourself too much.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.840]   Again, everything in moderation, especially when you're pregnant.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   It's almost the inverse of what we know for males, which is if men want to conceive, they should avoid the
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.120]   sauna because we know that heat is detrimental to sperm viability in a real way. So much so that
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.640]   I tell guys, if they are trying to get their partner pregnant, that they should bring an ice
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.960]   pack into the sauna. They should insulate that ice pack. Don't put it directly on the scrotum
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.920]   for other reasons, but that it's a, you know, that the effects of heat, the negative effects of heat
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.880]   on sperm are real. But there's also an interesting, it's not just a trend. There's actually some research
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:18.040]   showing that cooling the testicles leads to increases in testosterone, which is on the face of it kind of
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:27.160]   counterintuitive because it turns out that it's about the vasoconstriction causing the subsequent
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.320]   increase in blood flow, increased vasodilation. So the inverse of what you just said, which is that
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.880]   during the heating process, the hypoxia induces more vascularization of the placenta. So when
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.400]   talking about temperature, one always has to think about the surface of the body versus the brain
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.560]   response, as we talked about earlier, and then what's happening during the deliberate heat or deliberate
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.920]   cold versus what's happening after the deliberate heat or deliberate cold, right? Everything in biology
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.800]   is a process, not an event. Yeah. And I should make full disclosure. I started as an environmental
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.360]   exercise physiologist and my PhD was all in heat and heat research. So I'm a little bit biased towards
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   heat, but I've done a significant amount of research in the hot and cold. Thank you for the disclosure.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.280]   Yeah. I see it more as an indication of real knowledge. So thank you. This is an aspect of your
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.880]   training I knew a little bit about based on your publications, but I didn't realize the depth of
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:30.120]   knowledge. So we're all benefiting here.
