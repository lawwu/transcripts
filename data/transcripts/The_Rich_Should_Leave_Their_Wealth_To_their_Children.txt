[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Who's your Realtor?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Seriously, who is your Realtor?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Lately, there's been a lot in the news about real estate and Realtors.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So let us help clear the air.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   California Realtors are Californians just like you,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   your neighbor, your best friend's brother,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and your kid's baseball coach.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And we all strive every day to be your trusted advisors
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   on the biggest financial decision of your life.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   No one cares more about helping Californians live the California dream
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   than California Realtors.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Because we know California real estate is not easy.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   That's an understatement.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   But if you're a first-timer, we help you confidently get in the game.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And if you've been there, done that,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   we're there to help you get through what's new and different.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We tirelessly negotiate so you don't have to.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And we help you get past all the tough stuff and on to the good stuff.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Not because it's our job, but because it's your dream.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Let's go to work.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   California Association of Realtors.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   The rich should leave their wealth to their children,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   not to charity.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Mick Jagger's announcement that he would not leave his fortune to his children
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   caused much controversy.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   A chorus of celebrities have announced the same.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I've told the same thing my dad told me.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   My dad says, "When I die, you can expect that I'm going to die broke
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and you're going to be paying for the funeral."
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Guy Fieri, net worth about $100 million.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   "I just think all an inheritance does is breed laziness and entitlement.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I worked hard and I'm going to spend it all and have fun with my husband."
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Marie Osmond, net worth perhaps $20 million.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   "There won't be much money left because we are spending it.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We have a lot of commitments.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   What comes in, we spend, and there isn't much left.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   They have to work."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Sting, net worth about $550 million.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   "I am determined that my children should have no financial security."
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Nigella Lawson, net worth about $20 million.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   My basic reaction to these statements is disgust.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Many of these celebrities are keen to announce to the world
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   that their wealth will go to charity.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Left unsaid, however, is that they intend to spend the rest of their lives
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   living as some of the wealthiest people on earth.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   They will not release their riches.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Death will release their riches for them.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Their children will experience the change.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   They will not.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But it is, of course, the parents who secure the applause.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   These parents are keen to emphasize that they are giving their children the gift of work.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's for their own good.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The parents are, of course, past the need to work.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   They have already morally ascended, leaving menial work far behind.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   No, they can relax.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Other celebrity parents will tell you that they're actually continuing to work themselves,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   as stewards of their fame and fortunes, i.e., things that are enjoyable to work on.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   The suggestion that their children inherit this stewardship is, of course, ridiculous.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Young adults must spend years working in meaningless, bottom-tier jobs,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   or else they will be morally ruined.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Far better to disperse the estate and to leave the children to fend for themselves.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   This notion that everything must be broken apart every generation
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and thrown into the market to churn has a long history in the liberal tradition.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Adam Smith, the so-called father of capitalism, railed against entails,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   legal structures designed to keep estates intact across generations.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Entails are disadvantageous to the improvement of the country,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and these lands where they have never taken place are always best cultivated.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Heirs of entailed estates have it not in their view to cultivate lands,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and often they are not able to do it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The man who buys land has this entirely in view,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and in general the new purchasers are the best cultivators.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Adam Smith, Lectures on Jurisprudence
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Like our celebrities, Smith's view was predicated on the notion of the importance of "the work."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Continuously breaking intergenerational structures ensured maximum productivity
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   as hungry new generations sought to secure a fortune for themselves.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   In Smith's view, nothing should be sacred or spared from this churn.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   The market should extend into all domains.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Productivity is held in higher regard than absurd and outdated traditions.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Royal forests, wild environments preserved for the excellence of hunting across generations,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   were a prime example of something that must be destroyed in order to unlock productivity.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   In all the great monarchies of Europe, there are still many large tracts of land which belong to the crown.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   They are generally forest, a mere waste and loss of country and respect both of produce and population.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   In every great monarchy of Europe, the sale of the crown lands would produce a very large sum of money.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   When the crown lands had become private property, they would, in the course of a few years,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   become well-improved and well-cultivated.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Gone are the royal forests, but think of the agribusinesses that could replace them.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I regard this view as entirely autistic.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Hopefully this is self-evident, but to this I will return.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Many celebrities reassure us that, although they are not giving their children their inheritance,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   they are giving them the gift of a first-class upbringing and education.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Let's play out the consequences of this.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Now, instead of a young adult with a first-class upbringing and education,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   gradually taking stewardship of the family estate,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   a position of influence from which they could positively affect the lives of many people,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   they will be forced to pursue a lucrative career in order to continue their family lifestyle.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Fantastic! The world just gained another financier, lawyer, or management consultant.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It is often asked, where are all the great academic geniuses,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   the philosophers and scientists whose names echo in history, have gone?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Why are we no longer producing them?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Part of the answer is surely that our generation's geniuses design algorithmic trading technologies
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and social media attention maximization tools.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   They have, logically, chosen to maximize the production of the wealth that they were not given.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Gone are the gentleman polymaths.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Instead, academia is a desperate, all-out war for funding,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   with dubious proposals and grant manipulation taking more time and energy
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   than self-funded inquiry pursued for its own sake.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   The notion that the moral quality of our elites is improved by laundering them through the job market is absurd.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   A lifetime of spreadsheet work does not make you a better person,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   especially if you feel resentful at being robbed of your inheritance.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   In fact, what is often happening is that bad celebrity parents are attempting to outsource
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   the cultivation of the virtues of discipline and ambition to the job market,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   rather than succeeding in inculcating these virtues as a parent.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   The false virtue of "work for work's sake" is an attempt at mitigating bad parenting.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Deep down, celebrity parents realize their failure to raise children worthy of power,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   who can be trusted to be good stewards of their inheritance,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and so the parents cut the children off in the bud.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   But society will always have elites. If one generation hamstrings their children from taking its place,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   someone else will fill the elite vacuum.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The actual effect of this hamstringing is to ensure that our societal elites are perpetually first-generation wealth,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   i.e., the latest obsessive fund manager or entrepreneur to take his morally dubious tech product to IPO.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The tyranny of the nouveau riche.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Would Britain be a better place if the royal family sold everything they owned and gave the proceeds to a climate charity?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Buckingham Palace could serve as a museum for hordes of half-interested Spanish schoolchildren to visit,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   or perhaps a nice second home for a Ukrainian oligarch who earned his wealth.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Yes, the British people would lose one of the cornerstones of their culture, identity, history, and place in the world,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   but think of the solar panels we could build. Prince William could go and become an optician and become a better person.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   In fact, why stop there? Why should the British people benefit unjustly from their cultural inheritance
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and enjoy the sight of lavish, unnecessary palaces which occupy huge parts of valuable real estate in central London?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   If we level them, we could sell that land and build a second financial district,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   which could meritocratically employ the next generation of self-made men and give the proceeds to the Gates Foundation
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   so they can do whatever it is that they're doing. I'm told it advances human flourishing.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Unfortunately, this kind of faceless "charity" removes the donating celebrities from any kind of personal contact with the needy
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and any kind of personal responsibility, privation, or work.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Wealth is just vaguely diffused after death, a last self-satisfied gasp.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Ultimately, do you trust a faceless organization more than your child?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   If so, what does that say about the family you have built?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   One of the key drivers of this process is the modern capitalization of wealth.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The very rich now hold the majority of their wealth in intangible financial assets rather than land.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   This has significantly warped how these families think about wealth,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   driving detachment from personal ties and responsibilities.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   If the end goal of wealth generation is to end up with liquid, fungible assets
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   (stocks, shares, investment portfolios), then the nature of the business you build does not matter.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   It is just being built to be sold.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   It will not be a multigenerational family business determining the competencies and destinies of your descendants.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It will be sold on the secondary markets within half a decade of being founded.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Who cares if it's fundamentally meaningless or unhealthy?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Conversely, if this wealth was held in land, and a single family was tethered to that land across generations,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   it becomes natural to consider definite, physical, local, personal projects
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   to meaningfully improve the beauty and health of the society around oneself.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   A landed inheritance is not just wealth; it is history, responsibility, leadership, and the dependence of the surrounding community.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Anything that requires multigenerational education to appreciate and support,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   like the fine arts, ballet, music, etc., wither and gradually disappear.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Nurturing the heights of civilizational refinement is a non-trivial responsibility.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   What cannot wholly disappear, like the buildings of the great estates,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   becomes lifeless and ossified, becoming museum pieces rather than elements of a living culture.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   But no, our celebrities choose discontinuity between father and son,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   between one generation and the next.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   No shared responsibility and destiny, just a total reset to individualization.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   At the deepest level, the issue is that our society no longer has a conception
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   of what an elite man or family is supposed to do,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   what their values, responsibilities, roles, and teleology are.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   What aging celebrities are really conceding is that they have built nothing of substance,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   nothing that is worth keeping together, nothing worth protecting.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   They have made no contribution to what Burke called the "ballast of the commonwealth."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Burke's defense of the preservation of the estates of the great families of the 18th century
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   illustrates how far we have fallen and how much we have lost.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Contrast the following to today's elites. The power of perpetuating our property and our families
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   is one of the most valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   and that which tends the most to the perpetuation of society itself.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It makes our weakness subservient to our virtue. It grafts benevolence even upon avarice.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   The possessors of family wealth and of the distinction which attends hereditary possession,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   as most concerned in it, are the natural securities for this transmission.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   "Let those large proprietors be what they will, and they have their chance of being amongst the best.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   They are, at the very worst, the ballast in the vessel of the commonwealth."
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Instead, we have abstracted all agency away from humans and into a depersonalized system,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and that system is failing. Our society deserves a better class of elite.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Society is indeed a contract. It is to be looked on with other reverence.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   those who are dead, and those who are to be born.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract of eternal society,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the visible and invisible world,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   according to a fixed compact, sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and all moral natures each in their appointed place.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   The municipal corporations of that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at their pleasure
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   and on their speculations of a contingent improvement,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   wholly to separate and tear asunder the bands of their subordinate community
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos of elementary principles.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   This essay was published by Johann Kurtz.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   You can find a link to the original in the description for today's podcast.
