[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.960]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, in the 16th verse, and then in Paul's
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.160]   epistle to the Philippians, in the third chapter, in verses 20 and 21.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.920]   John 1, 16, "And of his fulness of all we received, and grace for or upon grace."
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.880]   And again, in Philippians 3, 20 and 21, "For our conversation is in heaven, from whence
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.120]   also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.400]   it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.480]   is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.880]   Now, those who worship here regularly will know exactly why I take two texts like that
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.200]   and bring them together.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.480]   We are really considering, as our fundamental text, John 1, 16, "And of his fulness have
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.880]   all we received, and grace upon grace."
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.680]   Now, there, as we have been seeing so repeatedly, is the great New Testament definition of what
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.440]   it is to be a Christian.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.680]   Christian is not only a man who believes on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.040]   He must do that, but it does not stop at that.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.200]   The devils believe and also tremble.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.400]   What makes us Christian is that we have actually received of his fulness.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.440]   This whole doctrine of the rebirth is absolutely vital to a true comprehension of what it means
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   to be a Christian.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.600]   "He came unto his own," as John tells us there in that prologue, "he came unto
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.680]   his own, and his own received him not; but to as many as received him gave he power to
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.560]   become the sons of God."
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.280]   Now, that's it.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.240]   "Who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men,
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   but of God."
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:35.160]   And so the Christian life starts by our receiving that seed of eternal life, that is, regeneration.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.360]   But that's only the beginning, and we go on receiving.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.200]   And John emphasizes the fact that all of us have received it, not only some, of his fulness
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.960]   of all we have received.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:55.360]   And grace upon grace, it continually is being added unto, and we grow in grace and in the
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.480]   knowledge of the Lord.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.920]   We don't remain infants or children in Christ.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.760]   We become young men, we become middle-aged, as it were, and we become old men in Christ,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.400]   receiving increasingly of his fulness.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.480]   Well now, what we are doing at the moment is this.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.160]   We have seen that this is something by which we must obviously therefore test ourselves.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.320]   We are constantly exhorted in the New Testament to do so, to prove ourselves, to examine ourselves,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.080]   to see whether we are in the faith or not.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   There is this appalling danger of an intellectual belief, but that is of no value unless we
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.760]   have received his life, his fulness.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.960]   So we are examining ourselves to see whether we really are in this position, and there
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.360]   are many ways in which we can do so.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.440]   There are many teachings found in the New Testament, deliberately provided for us in
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   order that we may test ourselves.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.760]   And in addition to that, there are these examples and illustrations in what we are told about
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.480]   the lives of Christian people in the Scriptures.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.520]   Then in addition to that, we have a great wealth of material and of literature.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.800]   We can read the long story of the Christian church, we can read the lives and the biographies
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.640]   of saints, and here we see men and women who have received of his fulness.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.080]   And we can examine ourselves in the light of these, and so make sure that we have received
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.320]   something of this fulness.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.160]   Well now, what we are actually doing is this.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.920]   We find that in the epistle to the Philippians, the great apostle, for various reasons, gives
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:55.680]   us certain glimpses into his own life, into what was true of him as the result of his
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.360]   receiving of this fulness.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.640]   And we are examining these in order that we may examine ourselves in the light of them.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   We've seen already that he says, "To me to live is Christ."
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   That's life to him.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.840]   His whole view of death has likewise been changed to dying, he says, is gain.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.000]   He says that our conversation, our manner of living, should be always as "becometh
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240]   the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.640]   And he tells us in detail what that means, including having that mind in us which was
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.760]   also in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   He tells us that his happiness and his joy was entirely determined by this fulness that
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.720]   he had received from the Lord.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.520]   Finally, my brethren, he says, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:53.120]   He goes on saying it, "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, rejoice."
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.920]   No man can receive anything of the fulness of Christ without knowing something of this
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.960]   joy and rejoicing.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.560]   A miserable Christian is a contradiction in terms.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.480]   We are meant to be a rejoicing people, and if you are aware of anything of this fulness
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.480]   within you, you must be the most joyful person in the world this morning.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:23.800]   Then we saw last Sunday morning that the ambition of the apostle is entirely controlled and
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.400]   determined by this, and what a thorough test that is.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.840]   We can very soon tell what a man is when we know what his ambition is, and the apostle's
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:44.040]   ambition was to know him, and to be made more and more conformable unto him, and finally
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.400]   to be perfect and entire in him.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.600]   But now this morning we move on to another test which he gives us in these two verses
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.640]   here at the end of this third chapter.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.680]   Our conversation, our citizenship is in him.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.640]   From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.720]   vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.800]   whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   What is this?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:30.160]   Well, I would describe this as the Christian's expectation and the Christian's hope.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:38.200]   And here again, you see, is an aspect of life which we of necessity must face.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.760]   Hope springs eternal, we are told, in the human breast.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.840]   Without hope, life is indeed pointless.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.400]   And so mankind tries to buy up its own hopes.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.560]   And that is a thing that keeps civilization going, in a sense.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.360]   Hope springs eternal in the human breast.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.080]   But as we shall see and as we know, as Christian people, that is a vain and a false hope.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.200]   But even that is something, and it keeps people going.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.440]   And when they lose hope, everything is gone.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.120]   So it is a very good way whereby we can test ourselves.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.320]   And what the Apostle is saying is that the Christian's hope is entirely in this person.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.480]   You see, everything is in him.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   It is of his fullness that we have received, and grace upon grace, he is everything to
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   us.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:35.360]   The Alpha and the Omega, the first, the last, the beginning, the end, the all and the in-all.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.680]   So our hope as Christians, our expectations, must be entirely and altogether in him.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.880]   So we can test ourselves this morning.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.060]   What do we hope for?
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.320]   What are we expecting?
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   What are we anticipating?
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.160]   What do we long for?
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.360]   What is this main spring, as it were, in our life?
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.840]   Well now the Apostle tells us that there was no difficulty about his answering that question,
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.280]   and he indicates that there should be no difficulty in the case of any single Christian.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.800]   Here, you see, he is contrasting the Christians with those who are not Christians.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   He is at any rate contrasting those who are truly Christian with those who appear to be
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.000]   Christian only.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.720]   He starts his statement with the word "for," "but," "our" conversation.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.900]   And "our" is in the emphatic position in the original, in order to show that he is
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.920]   emphasizing what we are, in contradistinction with what others are.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:42.120]   Listen, he puts it like this, "Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.360]   which walk so as ye have us for an ensemble.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.320]   For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.800]   the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose gob is their belly,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.280]   and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things."
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:09.800]   But "our" conversation, "our" citizenship, is in him.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.760]   He says this is one of the great differences.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:19.040]   Once a man receives of his fullness, his whole outlook, as it were, his whole position with
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.240]   respect to this question of hope and of expectation, is entirely changed.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.440]   Well now, it would be a very simple thing indeed for me this morning to show you that
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.360]   there is no more characteristic note in the whole of the New Testament teaching than just
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.240]   this very matter of the hope.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.960]   And of course it's prominent in the New Testament for this reason.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.400]   You don't understand the New Testament Christians apart from this particular doctrine.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.440]   It wasn't an easy thing to be a Christian in the first century.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.520]   It was a very costly and a very dangerous thing.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   We see even there how, in the records, how they were persecuted and how they were tried.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.880]   We know that large numbers of them were put to death.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.400]   You see the Greek, the Greek and Roman world, and especially the Roman government, it wanted
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.880]   men and women to say that Caesar is Lord, and it disliked this new teaching.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   Indeed, it regarded the Christians as atheists.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.720]   They had so many gods, and when people didn't worship a multiplicity of gods, they said
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.320]   they're atheists.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.720]   These people don't believe in the gods, so they subjected them to persecution.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.920]   And it is a sure fact of history, of course, that thousands upon thousands of Christian
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.600]   people suffered martyrdom.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:55.120]   Most of these apostles did, and even the ordinary Christians suffered in a like manner.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:03.040]   But what is so striking is this, that far from being daunted at such a prospect, far
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.600]   from being alarmed or terrified, these people even rejoiced in it.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.480]   They thanked God that they'd been accounted worthy to suffer shame and even death for
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.120]   his name's sake.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.880]   A very good case can be made out for saying that what really conquered the ancient world
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.560]   was the way in which these Christian people died.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.760]   They'd lost the fear of death.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.120]   They'd already conquered it before they had to meet it.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.560]   They could smile in the face of death.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.600]   They could smile in the face of the greatest tyrants.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.280]   Now what was the secret of that?
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.520]   What was the thing that enabled them to behave in such a manner?
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.100]   Well, the answer is quite simple.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:51.280]   It was just this matter of their hope, the very thing to which the apostle is adverting
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.400]   in these two verses.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:01.960]   This is the sole explanation of their attitude towards life and death and everything.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.440]   It was the thing that made them more than conquerors.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.760]   There are endless statements to that effect.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.080]   You remember that most eloquent statement of it, perhaps, at the end of 2 Corinthians
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:19.640]   4, in verses 17 and 18, "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:27.080]   a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.040]   are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:36.040]   For the things which are seen are temporal; the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   That's it.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   Well, now, then, that's the very thing that the apostle is telling us at this point, at
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.760]   the end of this third chapter of the epistle to the Philippians.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.520]   Let's examine his statement.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.680]   Fortunately he divides it up for us in order that we may not be content with some vague
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   feeling within us.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.120]   It's a very specific thing, this hope.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.840]   The Christian hope is not just a subjective feeling.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   It isn't a mere spirit of hopefulness.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.640]   It's a very specific thing.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.960]   And the apostle tells us what that is.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.600]   Let me put it like this to you.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:22.120]   The hope, in other words, centers upon the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.360]   From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:34.080]   Now, the apostle says elsewhere, "When Christ, who is our hope, shall appear."
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.600]   Same thing.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:43.720]   Christ is our hope, and he says that he is our hope because he is the Saviour.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:50.200]   Now here's the most important designation of our Lord, the Saviour.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.600]   What does he mean by that?
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.480]   Now, it's very important that we should be clear as to its meaning and connotation
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.400]   in this particular connection.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.520]   If I ask you the question, "What do you mean by 'Saviour'?"
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.320]   I've no doubt most people would answer and say, "Well, it means that he has died for
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.480]   me and my sins, and he saves me from hell and from punishment, and he saves me for the
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   kingdom of God."
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.760]   And you're perfectly right.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   But here, the apostle doesn't actually mean that.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.560]   He means that, but something much more than that.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:28.200]   And this is a very important distinction from the standpoint of understanding this New Testament
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.080]   doctrine concerning the hope.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.760]   From whence also we expect the Saviour?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.120]   In this sense, he is yet to be the Saviour.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:46.240]   He is already our Saviour in a personal sense, and of course we've already dealt with it.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.320]   The apostle has already shown us that he is our Saviour in the matter of justification.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.080]   We are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.440]   and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.320]   He is our justification in the sense that we no longer look to our own righteousness,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.960]   which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.120]   is of God by faith.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.840]   And then we saw last Sunday that he is our sanctification also, the power of his resurrection
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:25.680]   working in us, delivering us, purifying us, and leading us on to ultimate glorification.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:33.980]   Now, there is the personal aspect of salvation, but here I say the apostle is not referring
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.980]   to that.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.980]   It's included.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.980]   Thank God it's included.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.520]   But there's something much bigger here, something yet more glorious.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:49.080]   We also look for and expect the Saviour from that heaven which is the place of our citizenship.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.560]   What's he talking about?
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:17:03.000]   Well, he really is referring here to the Lord Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the cosmos,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.780]   the whole universe.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.680]   That's his conception here, and nothing less than that.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.280]   Now, he has already given us a hint about this in the second chapter, where in verses
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.320]   9, 10, and 11 you see he puts it like this, that our Lord, having been obedient unto death,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.760]   even the death of the cross, wherefore, because he's done that, God also hath highly exalted
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.280]   him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.200]   should bow of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:45.880]   that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.720]   Now, there is this very notion.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:18:02.720]   Jesus Christ as Lord, Lord of the whole universe, Lord over all, set above and beyond all principality
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   and power.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.600]   The apostles were so thrilled by this that he constantly goes on repeating it.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:14.520]   There, in writing to the Ephesians, he talks about the great power of God which he wrought
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.600]   in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.920]   places far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.280]   is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.160]   under his feet.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.280]   That's it, this idea of the Lordship of Christ.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.800]   And what the apostle, therefore, is holding before us is this.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:49.360]   He's saying this is the Christian's hope, that the Lord Jesus Christ is going to be
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.160]   the Savior of the whole universe.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:59.320]   In other words, we are taken here, you see, to look at the whole business of salvation
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.480]   from this cosmic aspect.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.760]   Our danger always is to think of these things solely in personal and in subjective terms.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.640]   Of course, we must stop there, and it's natural and right that we should do so, but
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.200]   we must never stop there.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.280]   We must realize that this whole universe is God's universe.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.280]   He made it.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   He made it perfect.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.560]   But our last sin came in.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.040]   The devil fell, and he led men to fall, and the whole universe has fallen.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.680]   And the whole creation went down when men went down.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.640]   The creature, says Paul in Romans 8, was made subject of vanity, not willingly, but by reason
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.360]   of him that subjecteth the same in hope.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:47.240]   When men fell, a part of the consequence was that God cursed the ground.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.760]   And so we have to realize this, that God's universe has been marred as the result of
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:58.200]   sin and evil, the devil and his followers, and therefore the fall of men, the fall of
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.080]   the whole human race.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:08.880]   And what the apostle is telling us here is this, that Jesus the Lord Christ is the Savior.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.120]   He's going to save the whole cosmos.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.880]   He's going to restore it to God in utter, absolute perfection.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:26.440]   So here is a tremendous conception, and as I'm trying to show you, this was the thing
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:33.720]   that sustained those early Christians, as it has sustained Christian people in all the
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.880]   great periods of the Church throughout the running centuries.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.840]   And the measure of our understanding of the hope this morning is the measure and the degree
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:52.600]   to which we think of the Lord Jesus Christ as this cosmic Savior, this grand conception
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:21:01.760]   of his being sent by God in order to redeem not only us as individuals, but that all things
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.680]   may be restored in him.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.760]   Again, perhaps the best statement of all of this conception is in Ephesians 1.10, that
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:18.040]   in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:25.480]   in Christ, both which are in him and which are on earth, even in him.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:33.040]   Now, he is the Savior in that sense, and what Paul believed and what the early Christians
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:39.360]   believed is that there is this mighty process going on, this great purpose of God is being
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.360]   fulfilled.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.120]   He's not going to allow the devil to be finally triumphant, but he's sent his Son
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:51.800]   into the world to be the Savior of the world, the cosmos, the whole universe.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:57.200]   There's the fundamental thought.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:04.560]   All the consequences of the fall are going to be undone, and there is to be a grand and
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:12.600]   a glorious regeneration when the Son of Man shall come.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:19.920]   Very well, in the light of that, he tells us that as Christians we ought to have a new
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.920]   view of life in this world.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.000]   And that is the thing that he brings out here, as I say, in a striking contrast.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.480]   Our conversation, our citizenship is in him.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:43.600]   Now, this is one of the profoundest things in connection with the Christian life, one
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:50.720]   of the profoundest conceptions, and it is only to the extent we become conscious of
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:58.120]   this that we shall be showing without any doubt that we have received of his fullness.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.560]   In other words, as the apostle, we like everybody else are still in this world, but we are no
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.280]   longer of it.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.740]   We no longer belong to it.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.920]   We are citizens away from home.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.160]   We are in a strange country.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.720]   We don't belong here.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   That's where we belong.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.440]   Our citizenship is there.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:28.200]   That's our home, that's the place where we rejoice in our citizenship.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   That's where we are registered.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:38.560]   Now, you see, there are certain things that follow of necessity from this.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.540]   The Christian, according to the New Testament teaching, is not only a man who is forgiven.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:51.680]   He has been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   Son.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   You see, the teaching of the New Testament is always in terms of kingdoms.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:05.160]   Take that hymn we've just been singing, "And the kingdoms of this world become the
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.640]   kingdom of his Son."
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.280]   I noticed some of you sang in the plural in that last line.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.280]   You were quite wrong.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   You'd missed the whole point.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:20.140]   The kingdoms of this world do not become the kingdoms of his Son, because there's only
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.840]   one kingdom.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.040]   The kingdoms become his kingdom.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.120]   He reigns and rules over all.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.240]   There's only one kingdom, the kingdom of his Son.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:37.720]   Now, the New Testament, I say, always describes salvation in these terms.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:44.840]   This world, as the result of the fall of men, as the result of men's lunacy in listening
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:50.040]   to the devil, this world has become the kingdom of Satan.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.520]   He is the God of this world.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.400]   He is the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now ruleth in the children
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.680]   of disobedience.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:07.200]   Now then, what salvation does is to take us out of that kingdom and to put us into the
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.400]   kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.480]   You remember when our Lord came.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.520]   He began to preach, and this is, we are told, how he began to preach.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.440]   He says, "The time is fulfilled.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.920]   The kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.440]   It's arrived.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.960]   Repent and believe the gospel."
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.440]   And on he goes to speak about the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:36.240]   The essence of our Lord's teaching is about this kingdom.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.400]   And he tells us that the thing that must happen to us is that we become the children of this
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.220]   kingdom.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.720]   We must be delivered from the dominion and the kingdom of Satan, and we must be brought
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.640]   into this kingdom of his.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:55.280]   He's come to establish the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.440]   So the whole of the teaching of the New Testament is in terms of this kingdom.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.760]   And so a Christian, I say, is not just a man who's been forgiven, he's a man whose whole
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760]   position has changed.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:13.160]   It's like a man changing his nationality, he's changing his citizenship.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.600]   He ceases to belong to one country and he belongs to another.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.520]   His name is taken off the books of this one, his name is added to the books of that one,
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.800]   he's registered there, that's his passport in future, that's where he belongs, he no
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.200]   longer belongs here, his whole situation is different.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:36.040]   Now that's exactly the New Testament teaching with regard to this matter.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:45.080]   And any man who has received of his fullness is a man who now is a child of God, and he's
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.280]   a citizen of the kingdom of God.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.920]   Well, let me give it to you again in terms of Ephesians, Ephesians 2.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:58.140]   He says, "Now, therefore, you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens,
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.400]   fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God."
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.520]   There it is, same thing exactly.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.320]   Very well then, what we say about ourselves is this, that we no longer belong to this
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   world order.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:20.520]   And I know no more comforting thought this morning than just that.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.320]   You look out at this troubled world and you're involved in its business and in its affairs,
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.800]   in its trials and tragedies and troubles, but this is the thing that puts the Christian
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.680]   into an entirely different position.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.720]   He says, "I no longer belong to this.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:39.800]   I'm here, I'm away from home, I've got to endure this, but I don't belong to it."
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:46.600]   Not only that, he sees it all as something which is passing, which is ephemeral.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.520]   The trouble, the tragedy with the non-Christian is that he's so earthbound, and he's so
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.600]   tied to the present and to the visible, and all his happiness and his pleasure is involved
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.440]   in this, and he gets unhappy and he gets excited when things begin to go wrong, and he's
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.680]   filled with forebodings, and he's foolish enough to believe that the world can be put
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.280]   right by acts of parliament and by congresses of nations.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.400]   He believes all that, and therefore he's constantly disappointed.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.160]   But the Christian is in an entirely different position.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.740]   He doesn't belong.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.840]   He's interested in what's happening.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.040]   He does his best while he's here, but he doesn't belong to this, and his destiny is not tied
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.780]   to this.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.520]   The Christian is in an entirely different position.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.120]   He doesn't belong.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.200]   He's interested in what's happening.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.380]   He does his best while he's here, but he doesn't belong to this, and his destiny is not tied
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.480]   to this.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.140]   He sees that all this is but a passing phase.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:56.800]   He knows of something that lies beyond it all and infinitely greater than it all.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.720]   You remember how John puts it, he says, "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:07.480]   and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world,
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.920]   and the world passeth away, and the lust thereof.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.000]   But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   You see, this man, he's been moved into a new position.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.560]   He looks down upon the world, and he sees the world and its pomp and ceremony and all
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.680]   its glittering prizes as something passing, evanescent, moving, shifting.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   And from eternity, the kingdom of God, he looks on upon this passing, shifting scene.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.000]   He doesn't belong to it.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.360]   His hopes are not attached to that.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.080]   His ambitions are not there.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.860]   His expectations are not there.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:48.820]   You see, he's come to see all this as evil.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.200]   And here is a very fundamental distinction.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.500]   The moment a man receives of the fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ, he comes to see
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.600]   that this is an evil world.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.880]   There may have been a time when as a typical worldling, he says, "Isn't life wonderful?"
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.280]   He never says that again.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.760]   He can't say it again, because he knows it's evil.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.480]   He sees it as the Lord Jesus Christ saw it, as an evil place.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.640]   The apostle in writing to the Galatians says that he died for us, that he might redeem
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.000]   us from this present evil world.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.560]   And that is how the Christian sees it all.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.880]   As I say, he's not bound to this, and he doesn't get his pleasure nor his happiness
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   here.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   His hopes are not here.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.480]   He sees all this as against God, anti-God, and he knows it's going to be destroyed,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.440]   so he sees it moving and shifting.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.680]   He can't delight in it.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680]   He doesn't belong.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   He is outside.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.720]   He's still living in it, but he doesn't belong to it.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.480]   Now, the apostle, you see, gives us a very good test here.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.760]   He says that people who belong to that system, that they mind earthly things.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:09.040]   And when he says that they mind them, he means that they spend their time in thinking about
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.480]   them.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   Those are the things that are on their minds.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:20.240]   Those are the things that are always turning round, as it were, in their minds.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.000]   That's life to them, obviously.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.040]   They know of nothing else.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.840]   They know of nothing better.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.240]   And they spend the whole of their time in talking about these things, thinking about
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.160]   them, dreaming about them, planning with respect to them.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.000]   Here is the whole of their interest.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.760]   There they are today reading these Sunday newspapers.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.760]   That's the thing they live on.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.760]   That's the thing they're interested in.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.440]   That's the thing they get excited.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:51.000]   They mind earthly things, evil in all its various forms.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.200]   God is their belly of glory and their shame.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:01.960]   What a perfect description of modern Britain—glorying in its shame, boasting of its iniquity, proud
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.320]   of its evil and the increasing manifestation of evil.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.960]   And it's all so thrilling and exciting.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.360]   They mind these things.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.360]   That's their whole outlook.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.360]   That's their whole interest.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   But our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.640]   In other words, the Christian, as I say, cannot mind these things because he knows they're
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.440]   all going to be destroyed.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.920]   And his greatest desire, indeed, is to be delivered from.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.480]   The Apostle Peter has a most extraordinary way of putting that.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.840]   He's exhorting those early Christians to have nothing to do with that old kind of life
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.320]   in which they'd lived and in which they'd been brought up.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:51.400]   And he puts it in this kind of way, "For as much then as Christ hath suffered for us
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.800]   in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.160]   For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin, that he should no longer
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:08.080]   live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of God.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.480]   For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:19.720]   when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banqueting, and
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:25.200]   abominable idolatries, wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.760]   same excess of riot, speaking evil of you."
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.960]   There it is.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.400]   You've done enough of that when you belong to that, says Peter.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.280]   You don't belong there any longer, so don't think of those things, don't do those things,
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   don't mind earthly things.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.440]   You belong to heaven and its kingdom.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.400]   Think heavenly thoughts.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.640]   And the things of heaven and of glory have nothing to do with the time past of your life
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.360]   was sufficient for that.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.680]   Realize that you've been taken right out of it and that you don't belong to it.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.280]   Our citizenship is in heaven, very well, so that you see the Christian immediately has
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.360]   an entirely new view of his life and existence in this world.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.080]   But then the third point, of course, is a more positive one.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:21.640]   He not only realizes his detachment from the present moving, shifting scene, but he looks
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.560]   for the coming of the Lord.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.360]   This is his hope.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:35.640]   Our citizenship is in heaven, "From whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.640]   Christ."
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.960]   Now this word translated here, "look," is a very powerful word.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.280]   This word, "look," is quite inadequate.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:52.240]   It really means that you look with eager and longing expectation.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:57.000]   I'm not saying that the authorities have agreed that that is the correct translation.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.460]   Eager and longing expectation.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:09.360]   We long for and expect with eagerness the coming of the Savior.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:15.000]   Now this is, I say again, something that is quite inevitable.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.200]   A man who has received of his fullness knows who he is.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.040]   He knows why he came into this world.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:27.120]   He knows the grand ultimate object and objective.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:33.400]   And it is a part of his belief to know this, that this blessed Savior shall come again
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.120]   and finish the work.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.880]   It hasn't finished yet.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.640]   Evil and sin are still left here, the devil is still powerful, but it's not going to
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640]   be left like that.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:51.920]   The Son will come again and he will destroy all this and, as I say, restore it to God
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:59.080]   in all its absolute and utter perfection.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:04.600]   So it is a part of the teaching, it was a part of the teaching of the Lord himself,
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   that he would come again, not as a babe of Bethlehem this time, but as the King of kings
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:17.720]   and as the Lord of lords, riding the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:23.200]   He'll come and he'll come to judge and he'll come to destroy evil and to set up
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.160]   his eternal kingdom.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.000]   And so this was the great hope of the New Testament Christians.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.600]   They lived by this hope.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.400]   And so you see, they could afford to be indifferent to what men might do.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.160]   They were not frightened of Caesars.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.180]   They were not frightened of any earthly human power.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.680]   They knew that even though they were killed, it wouldn't make any difference to this
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.800]   ultimate and eternal purpose.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.760]   So you see, the Apostle in writing to Titus put it, as we found there in Titus 2, verse
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.840]   11 and following, "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men."
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   Teaching us.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   What's it teach us?
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:08.520]   Well, it teaches us this, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:16.440]   righteously and godly in this present world, looking for the same word, that blessed hope
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:24.800]   and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:31.560]   for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.920]   zealous of good works.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.360]   Now, my simple argument, you see, is this, that if a man is received of the fullness
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:49.320]   of the Lord Jesus Christ, if he has this new life in him, this spiritual life, this pure
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.840]   life, he cannot be satisfied in this world and he cannot tolerate the world as it is.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.600]   It must grieve him that the world should be as it is this morning.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.840]   He sees the name of God blasphemed.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:08.640]   He sees evil proud and rampant and triumphant, as it were, and it here hurts him and it grieves
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:14.600]   him and he longs for the great day when the Son of God will come and rout all the enemies
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.120]   of God and of himself and set up this glorious kingdom.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.680]   He longs for it with eager expectation.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   It is inevitable.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:32.600]   There is a tremendous picture in the sixth chapter of the book of Revelation.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:38.960]   You remember that picture of the souls under the altar, the souls of those who had been
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.920]   beheaded for the testimony of Christ.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:50.320]   And we are told that they spend their time crying out, "How long, O Lord, how long,
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.320]   O Lord?
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:57.480]   When are you going to come and destroy these enemies that killed us?
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.160]   When are you going to come and destroy the enemies of God?
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.240]   When are you going to appear in the brightness of your glory and cause even kings and princes
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:14.880]   who are opposed to God to say unto the rocks, "Fall upon us and hide us"?
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:22.280]   Don't you see, my friends, that this kind of thing is quite inevitable?
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.640]   When a man has the life of God in his soul, when he has received of the fulness of Christ,
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:34.880]   he has got an entirely new outlook, and this becomes not only an evil world but a hateful
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.720]   world because it is anti-God.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:45.440]   And he longs to see the enemies of God destroyed and God over all and glorified.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:51.920]   And the day when every knee shall bow to the Lord Jesus Christ and honor him as the Son
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:57.760]   of God, the Savior of the world.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:09.600]   Thus also we long and look with eager expectation for the appearing of this blessed Savior.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.280]   That's implicit in it.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:18.160]   And so, you see, our very reaction to the world in which we live and to these days in
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:26.640]   which we are passing becomes a test of our whole position.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.240]   There are many moral men in the world today who are bemoaning this present wave of immorality
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.360]   and open licentiousness.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.320]   But you see, it's just an irritation to them.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.880]   And they just want to make it a little bit better, but they don't grieve, they don't
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.040]   think of it in terms of God, they don't think of it in terms of the kingdom and of
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.840]   eternity and God's purpose.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.120]   It's merely an irritation.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.080]   The Christian's reaction to the world is altogether different.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:01.840]   It is always based upon this doctrine of Christ as Savior and as the one who is going to come
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.160]   and complete the work which he began when he was here before.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.480]   And so I go on to the next point, which is this one.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:19.760]   That the Christian not only believes these things vaguely and loosely, he has an absolute
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.640]   and a certain confidence in them.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.760]   He knows.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.440]   And as I've said, it is because the early Christians had an absolute certainty with
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:35.080]   respect to these things that they were able to smile in the face of every opponent, and
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.480]   even in the face of death.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.100]   They knew that this was going to happen.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.120]   They might be taken off, what's it matter?
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.000]   What's the loss of a few years in the context of eternity?
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.960]   They had a faith that sees through death.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.160]   They saw the glory of the coming of the Lord.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.720]   They saw the ultimate.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.840]   They saw the final consummation.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.080]   Now the apostle is absolutely sure of this.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.560]   Listen to the way he puts it.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.320]   "Our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:10.480]   Christ, who shall change this, the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.880]   like unto the body of his glorification."
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   How?
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:19.520]   "By standing to, by means of, the power of the working, whereby he is able even to
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.160]   subdue all things unto himself."
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:29.880]   You see, here is the basis of his confidence.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   Everything is in Christ.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.600]   All the Christian's life is centred in Christ, his ambition, his hope, and everything else.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.640]   And what is it that makes his hope certain?
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:47.320]   Well, it is his knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, and especially of his power, according
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:54.280]   to the working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:02.160]   Now this might very well be translated like this, "according to the energy of his power."
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.960]   Or if you prefer it, "according to the manifestation or the exercising or the operation of his
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.240]   ability."
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.360]   He has got the ability.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:21.320]   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:27.440]   The same was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.840]   not anything made that was made.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.320]   In him was life, and the life is the light of men."
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:39.360]   There is the energy, there is the power, the power of the Creator that said, "Let there
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:46.760]   be light," and there was light, it is all in him.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:55.000]   And we have no doubt, says the Apostle, with regard to what is to come, because we know
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.960]   that when he exercises that energy and that power that is inherent in him, he is able
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.840]   to subdue all things to himself.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:14.680]   Though the Apostle has already said this in chapter 1 and in verse 6, "Being confident
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:21.240]   of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.560]   day of Jesus Christ."
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.840]   Nothing can hinder him.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:36.700]   He has already conquered our every enemy, and there is nothing that can stand between
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:41.520]   him and the fulfillment of his eternal purpose.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.960]   I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:53.040]   nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:59.920]   shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:06.980]   You look at your communism and your materialism, and all the philosophic agnosticism of today,
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:13.220]   and all the powers that are raising themselves against God and his Christ, but what are they?
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:19.600]   When you put them by the side of the energy of his power, he is able to subdue even all
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.120]   things unto himself.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.600]   Are you trembling for the ark of God?
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.480]   Are you nervous about the future?
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:35.080]   My dear friend, if you are, think again, realize these things, mind these things, the energy
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.800]   of his power.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.480]   There is nothing that can withstand it.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:51.440]   Onward march, all-conquering Jesus, gird thee on thy mighty sword, sinful hell can ne'er
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:57.000]   oppose thee, hell itself quails at thy word.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:05.080]   Jesus shall reign, where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run, his kingdom stretch
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:11.760]   from shore to shore, till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:21.240]   We are certain of it, nothing can prevent him, in God's time he'll come.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.760]   And lastly, we know that our hope is linked up with all that.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:37.920]   Here in the body pent, absent from him I roam; here in the body pent, I fight with sin and
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:44.320]   am aware of frailty and illness and disease, and death and sorrow and crying and tears.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:53.360]   Though shaved, we are in this veil of woe and of tears.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.840]   But in the light of that we know that there is a day coming when we shall be absolutely
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:04.920]   perfect, complete and entire.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:13.880]   Who shall change this, our vile body, the body of our humiliation?
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:22.320]   Not only will my spirit and my soul be saved and perfect and glorified, my very body will
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.940]   share in the glorification.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:37.000]   There will be an end to toil and sorrow and pain and sin and woe, and every infirmity
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.200]   and imperfection even of the physical frame.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:51.560]   We long with eager expectation for his appearing, for when he appears he shall not only destroy
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:57.480]   all his enemies and set up his eternal kingdom, but we shall be in it.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:05.280]   We shall see him as he is and we shall be like him in the glory, which is indescribable.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.320]   We shall reign with him, we shall be with him, we shall look into his face, we shall
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:19.360]   glorify his name forever and forever and be glorified by him.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.000]   Nothing can prevent this.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:30.640]   The exercising of the might of his power is such that every enemy shall be destroyed and
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:40.600]   the whole cosmos, the whole universe shall be in a state of perfect glory, absolute perfection
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:47.920]   and wonder of wonders.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.520]   You and I will be there to see it.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.040]   You and I will be there to live in it.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:02.380]   You and I will be there to enjoy it forever and forever.
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.160]   This is our hope, not in this world.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:11.000]   Fading is the worldling's pleasure, all his bursted pomp and show, solid joys and
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.200]   lasting pleasure none but Zion's children know.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:31.240]   The world and its kingdoms are passing away, but the kingdom of God abideth forever.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.000]   What does the Christian say?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:46.040]   This is the last word, as it were, in the Bible, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:50.640]   Are you living by that hope?
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:55.320]   Is Christ in you the hope of glory?
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:01.280]   Have you received sufficient of his fullness to know these things and to long for more
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:07.880]   and more and more, but above all, for the ultimate perfection, the absolute glorification,
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:15.360]   and to see him glorified over all and every knee bowing to him?
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:25.600]   Of things in heaven and things on earth, and every tongue confessing that Jesus Christ
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.200]   Is your citizenship there?
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.400]   Do you know you belong there?
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.120]   Is this a strange world to you?
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:43.280]   Are you but a stranger and a pilgrim, a sojourner, a journeyman?
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.280]   Is that your view of it?
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.100]   If you have any of the fullness in you, it must be.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:52.880]   You must be like he was, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, a pilgrim, a stranger
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:51:05.560]   passing through, but with your eye ever always on that glory which is yet to come, our citizenship
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:16.040]   is in heaven from whence also we look with eager longing and expectation for the appearing
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:25.600]   of our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.640]   Amen.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:46.000]   The closing hymn is hymn number 161, "Rejoice, the Lord is King, you are Lord and King adore,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:52:15.520]   Jesus Christ, the Lord is King, you are Lord and King adore."
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:25.080]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:34.520]   the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:46.160]   and majesty, dominion and power both now and ever, and may grace, mercy and peace from
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:53.920]   God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:53:04.860]   the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and until he
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:10.080]   shall come, amen.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
