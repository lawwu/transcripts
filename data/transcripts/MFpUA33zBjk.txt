[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Well, I love the theme of this year's conference, "Truth Triumphs," which of course, that is
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.720]   the victorious end note of biblical eschatology.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.480]   Truth will defeat every lie and every false ideology.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:29.260]   Christ wins, righteousness prevails, evil is defeated forever, virtue is eternally vindicated,
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.360]   and Christ is enthroned as Lord of all, and God is endlessly glorified.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.280]   And no matter what eschatological scheme you favor, if you are a true believer, you affirm
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.880]   that much.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.480]   Christ, who is the truth and the life, will be absolutely victorious in the end.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.440]   Evil will never again trouble God's creation.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.920]   The devil will be consigned to eternal punishment.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.760]   Truth triumphs, Christ guarantees it.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.200]   And one of the great truths of the New Testament is that no matter what trial or hardship you
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.320]   might be facing right now, if you are in Christ, you are already a participant in His triumph.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.960]   If you simply see things from heaven's perspective, you can always rejoice in that triumph.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.080]   In fact, here's an example for you, and full disclosure, they assigned me a passage from
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.880]   1 Peter 4, and I'm going to get there.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.840]   But I want to introduce this whole concept with a passage from the Apostle Paul.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.880]   In 2 Corinthians 2, Paul is dealing with some of the most difficult trials any church leader
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880]   could ever face.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.000]   He's writing to a church that he founded, but they were on the precipice of apostasy.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.380]   They had fallen under the influence of false apostles.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.640]   They had been too tolerant of sin in their midst.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.300]   They had apparently also botched a church discipline case, because Paul has to remind
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.720]   them in 2 Corinthians 2 verse 8 to reaffirm their love for this sorrowful but apparently
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.400]   repentant brother, and he's so troubled by the state of things in the Corinthian church
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.100]   that, according to verses 12 and 13, even though the door was wide open for him to do
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.440]   gospel ministry in Troas, Paul says, "I had no rest in my spirit."
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.720]   He had, you know, hoped to meet Titus in Troas, because according to 2 Corinthians 7, Titus
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.060]   had been in Corinth, and Paul wanted to know the state of the church in Corinth, and so
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.760]   Paul says, "Not finding Titus, my brother, I went to Macedonia."
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.720]   Now, follow this, he is explaining to the Corinthian church how deeply troubled he was
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.280]   about the spiritual state of things in their church, and when he picks up the account again
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.620]   in 2 Corinthians 7 verse 5, he says, "Even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.480]   no rest, but we were afflicted on every side, conflicts without, fears within."
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.160]   He's describing an unbearable bodily fatigue, "Our flesh had no rest."
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.620]   John Gill says it this way, "Paul was continually fatigued with preaching and disputing and
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.680]   fighting, what with false teachers and violent persecutors.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.520]   Afflicted on every side," Paul says, "external disputing with the enemies of the truth, and
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.280]   internal unrest because of his deep concern for the spiritual dangers the Corinthians
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   had let into their assembly," and so he was afflicted on every side.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.880]   Every kind of adversity was assaulting him from every possible angle, but he was not
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.140]   in a state of despair.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.500]   In chapter 4 verses 8 through 10, he describes it this way, he says, "We are in every way
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:15.820]   afflicted but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing, persecuted but not forsaken, struck
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.620]   down but not destroyed, always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus so that the
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.100]   life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.540]   Paul's triumph, giving new life and energy to overcome the bodily weariness of an afflicted
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.780]   soul, and back in chapter 2 after describing his soul's unrest when Titus wasn't in Troas
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.260]   and Paul had to go to Macedonia to make sure he could intersect with Titus, Paul interrupts
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.740]   himself at that point.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.440]   He won't come back and finish the story until chapter 7, but notice he interrupts his description
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:04.540]   of his own misery with this jubilant declaration, 2 Corinthians 2 verse 14, "But thanks be to
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.580]   God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ."
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.540]   Or if you, like me, memorize the King James, "Thanks be unto God who always causeth us
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.480]   to triumph in Christ."
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.080]   And one thing you've undoubtedly noticed about the Apostle Paul, every time he ever mentions
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.660]   his trials, troubles on every side, conflicts without, fears within, he always punctuates
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.880]   the mention of his adversity with this powerful proclamation of triumph.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.060]   Here in 2 Corinthians 2, "Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.300]   in Christ."
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.100]   In chapter 4, afflicted but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.020]   Even in chapter 7, immediately before, he says in verse 5, "We were afflicted on every
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.760]   side, conflicts without, fears within," just before that he says, verse 4, "As emphatically
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.360]   as possible, I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction."
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.820]   And that's how Christians are supposed to live, always carrying about in the body the
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:24.680]   dying of Jesus so that the life and the triumph of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.280]   And for the Christian, there is this perpetual triumph, even in affliction and persecution,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.380]   triumph through persecution.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.640]   That's actually the theme of the passage they've assigned me this year, 1 Peter 4, verses 12
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.000]   through 19.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.480]   So turn there with me.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.800]   While you're turning, I'll read the passage from the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.760]   "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial among you which comes upon you for your
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.700]   testing as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.940]   But to the degree you are sharing the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing so that at the
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.960]   revelation of his glory, you may rejoice with exultation.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.840]   If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit of glory
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.620]   and of God rests on you.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.760]   Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or a troublesome
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.880]   meddler.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.480]   But if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be put to shame but is to glorify God
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.200]   in this name.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.940]   For it is time for judgment to begin with the house of God.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.480]   And if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.520]   gospel of God?
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.940]   And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become of the godless
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.800]   man and the sinner?
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.880]   Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.000]   to a faithful creator in doing good."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.240]   Eight verses, and notice every one of them mentions afflictions of some kind.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.840]   This passage is full of words that evoke the idea of human suffering.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   Four times in the English versions, you have some variant of the word "suffering."
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.320]   And he also mentions testing, trials, insults, difficulty, and judgment.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.240]   But the word he doesn't use is "persecution."
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.560]   And yet, it's obvious from the context that the main kind of suffering he's talking about
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:46.080]   here is persecution, suffering for righteousness' sake, bearing insults and attacks, verse 16.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.600]   Suffering as a Christian.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.760]   And it's a theme that runs through the entire epistle of 1 Peter, and our passage is actually
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.920]   the pinnacle of that theme in 1 Peter.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.320]   Peter's writing to people who are living in exile, chapter 1, verse 1, "To those who reside
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.240]   as exiles scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia."
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.880]   So these are Christians whose lives have been interrupted.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.960]   They've been dispossessed of their homes and their livelihoods.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.960]   They've been driven by the threat of persecution to the outer edge of the Roman Empire.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.080]   And in fact, those five districts, Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, that
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:36.160]   covers virtually all of Asia Minor, that's the Turkish peninsula.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.040]   And by the way, that's a large land mass.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.480]   These people are truly scattered.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.960]   Asia Minor is twice the size of California.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.680]   So they're all over the place.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.160]   And furthermore, this is a part of the Roman world that we would normally associate with
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.360]   Paul's ministry.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.520]   And it appears Peter is writing here to a predominantly Jewish group of believers.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.160]   They're not really a group because they're scattered like this.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.080]   He is, after all, the apostle to the Jews.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.760]   And so these are Jewish exiles.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.520]   Circumstances have forced them to flee to a predominantly Gentile region of the Roman
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.040]   Empire, and so they reside as exiles scattered.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.280]   And he uses the word "scattered" in the Greek.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.960]   It's diaspora, which even in the first century was an expression that was used distinctively
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.680]   to speak of Jews who had been forced into exile away from their homeland.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.260]   So these people had most likely been driven away from Judea and Galilee because of a massive
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:53.080]   wave of government-sanctioned persecution against Christians under the Emperor Nero.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:59.680]   Most New Testament scholars date 1 Peter around the second half of A.D. 64 or sometime in
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.200]   the year 65, and this was a particularly volatile time.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:13.080]   On July 18th of the year 64, a catastrophic fire had started in Rome's Circus Maximus,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.680]   the chariot stadium there.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:24.880]   And by the time the last flames of that conflagration were extinguished, nine days later, more than
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.280]   70 percent of the city of Rome had been reduced to ashes.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.620]   It was one of the worst urban conflagrations in human history.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:41.280]   And historians say that the fire was deliberately started by the Emperor Nero to make way for
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.880]   an urban renewal project, and the fire got out of hand.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:53.960]   Tacitus, who was a first-century Roman historian whose life overlapped Nero, wrote in his history
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:02.160]   book Annals that in order to deflect the public wrath away from himself, Nero blamed Christians
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.880]   for starting the fire.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.860]   Roman Gentiles generally held all of the Jewish people in contempt.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:16.800]   There had been tension between Rome and Judea going back before the time of Christ's birth.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.560]   And Rome, in fact, at this time was already gathering its military might for a campaign
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.260]   that ultimately would result in the total destruction of the city of Jerusalem.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:34.000]   In fact, less than six years after the great fire of Rome, Titus Vespasian would reduce
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.200]   the temple in Jerusalem to rubble; it's never been rebuilt to this day.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.080]   The Roman army pillaged everything that had any value in Jerusalem and left the entire
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.940]   city just a pile of smoldering ruins.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:58.120]   So anti-Semitism was a strong undercurrent in pagan Roman society, and because the earliest
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:06.240]   Christians were all Jewish, Rome had always been a place where hostility to the Christians,
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.880]   in particular, festered just under the surface.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:15.760]   And Roman officials, you know, regarded the Christians as secretive, dangerous kind of
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.320]   misfits and even criminals.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:25.440]   Justin Martyr records that when the people of Rome overheard Christians talking about
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.400]   the Lord's Table, many of them concluded that the Christians were practicing cannibalism.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:39.080]   Christians were typically regarded as atheists because they refused to worship the pantheon
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:45.640]   of Roman gods and they were also accused of incest because they called one another brother
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:52.960]   and sister and spoke of being united together in one body and the depraved pagan ears interpreted
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.720]   all of that in the most sinister possible way.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.400]   So there was this comparatively tiny community of believers in Rome, but Roman officials
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.280]   regarded them as a sort of dangerous, fringe sect of Jewish extremists.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:15.760]   So Nero's lie intensified the public's contempt for Christianity, and the whole catalog of
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.600]   lies and false speculations about Christians circulated, starting in Rome but went throughout
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:29.480]   the whole Roman Empire, first as rumors, then as urban myths, and finally these false tales
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.520]   became the dominant narrative about Christianity.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:38.120]   And that's why Christians in first-century Rome were typically looked upon with deep
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:47.200]   distrust and dislike because most of the pagan public literally regarded Christians as criminals.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:54.400]   And all of this made Christians an easy scapegoat when Nero needed one to explain the Great
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.800]   Fire, and under his authority, Roman officials began to sanction and participate in the harshest
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.320]   forms of persecution against Christians.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:13.880]   Tacitus, who lived in that era, is the secular historian who recorded that Nero would bind
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:20.720]   Christians in thick wrappings of sackcloth and then tie them to poles, coat them with
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:29.120]   tar and oil, and set them ablaze, and he used them like candles to light his garden parties.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.440]   He also crucified believers.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.600]   Peter was ultimately one of Nero's victims, probably not very long after Peter wrote this
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.240]   epistle.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.920]   Nero also put Christians in the gladiatorial arenas to be eaten by wild animals for the
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.080]   entertainment of crowds.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.160]   And so the cruelty that was suffered by these saints is unimaginable to us.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.360]   The level of persecution where, you know, people were actually being burned alive and
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.240]   eaten by animals, that was confined mainly to Rome and the surrounding region.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:09.600]   But meanwhile, this notion that Christians are criminals actually reached to the outer
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.800]   edge of the empire, and in fact, that is precisely what was happening when members of that first
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:22.680]   generation of Christians in Jerusalem began to emigrate to Asia Minor.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.480]   These were the exiles that Peter is addressing his epistle to.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:33.720]   And even in Asia Minor, believers were not allowed to live and worship in peace.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:40.000]   These beleaguered saints fleeing the threat of persecution in their homeland would face
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.320]   several more decades of persecution in Pontus and Galatia and Cappadocia and Bithynia.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:54.480]   In fact, some 45 years after Peter wrote this epistle, the governor of Bithynia and Pontus
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.920]   was Pliny the Younger.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:04.080]   People whom Peter wrote this epistle to were no doubt still alive and still in permanent
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.680]   exile in Pontus and Bithynia.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.960]   And their governor, Pliny, wrote a letter to Trajan, who was the first Roman emperor
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:21.120]   of the second century, and Pliny asked Trajan for advice on how do we deal with these Christians.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.720]   And it's clear from the questions he asked that Christians were regarded as outlaws.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.480]   Pliny doesn't charge them with any specific crimes.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   It's evident that he believed just bearing the name Christian, affirming that Christ
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.880]   is Lord, that was crime enough.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.520]   And that is the environment in which these exiled saints were living.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.240]   That's the main reason why suffering is the theme that dominates not just our passage
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.320]   but the whole epistle.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.160]   Peter mentions suffering in every chapter of this epistle, starting in chapter 1 verse
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.840]   6 where he says, "Now for a little while you've been grieved by various trials."
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:10.320]   As you read the epistle, you realize that's an understatement, grieved by various trials.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.840]   They were living under the worst kind of persecution.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   And Peter is empathetic.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.240]   Peter knows that he himself will die as a martyr.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.120]   Enemies of the gospel will take away his liberty and then end his life.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.800]   And he knows this because Jesus told him in John 21 verses 18 and 19.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.920]   Immediately after he commissioned Peter with the words, "Tend My sheep," Jesus said to
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.840]   Peter, "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself and
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.320]   walk wherever you wished, but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.840]   else will gird you and bring you to where you do not wish to go."
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:59.320]   And the Apostle John, commenting on that, adds this, "This he said signifying by what
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.120]   kind of death he would glorify God."
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.800]   So Peter knew that martyrdom and persecution were in his future.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:14.120]   Living under vicious persecution is a subject that Peter no doubt thought a lot about.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:21.320]   He's the perfect pastor to compose this epistle to encourage these suffering saints in exile.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.960]   And he brings the subject up at the very start of the epistle, but it remains his central
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   theme really until his closing words when he writes at the end of the epistle, "Resist
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.720]   the devil, firm in the faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.240]   accomplished among your brethren who are in the world."
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.560]   In other words, you're not alone.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.480]   "And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:56.680]   to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore and strengthen and confirm and ground
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.480]   you to him be might forever and ever.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   Amen."
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.320]   It's a great benediction.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:09.140]   And notice, he's basically taken the theme I've been assigned, triumph in persecution.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:16.120]   And that closing benediction then summarizes all of his main points throughout the epistle,
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   really.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.280]   One, that suffering is the common experience of those who are truly saved.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.120]   Number two, that the pathway to glory is strewn with suffering.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.840]   But for believers, all of our suffering will give way to eternal glory.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.520]   And point three, our suffering is just for a little while in comparison with eternity.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:45.260]   It never seems like a short thing, but it really is just a little while in comparison
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.720]   with eternity.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.880]   It's not even a nanosecond.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.480]   In the words of the Apostle Paul, "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.840]   not worthy to be compared with the glory that's about to be revealed to us."
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.840]   Now notice, those three themes that I just named, those are standard Pauline themes as
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   well.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:11.480]   One, suffering in this life is the common experience of all believers.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.680]   Paul says in 2 Timothy 3:12, "Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.240]   be persecuted."
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.320]   Number two, our suffering prepares us for glory.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:30.380]   Romans 8:17, Paul says, "We suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him."
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.400]   And three, the hardships of this life are really nothing in comparison with heaven's
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.160]   glory.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:46.860]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:17, "Our momentary light affliction is working out for us an
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.160]   eternal weight of glory, far beyond all comparison."
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.200]   So those same three truths you see in Peter and Paul, they're also all three alluded
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.680]   to in the opening verses of our text, Philippians 4:12 to the end of chapter 4.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:08.400]   One, all true Christians suffer, this is an inevitable feature in the life of faith.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.320]   You see that in 2 Peter 4:12, "Do not be surprised at the fiery trial, as though something strange
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.680]   were happening to you."
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   Number two, suffering paves the way to glory, that's verse 13, "To the degree you are sharing
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.040]   in the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing so that also at the revelation of His glory
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.920]   you may rejoice with exultation."
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:37.040]   Because after all, verse 14, the spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:45.680]   And number three, the hardships pertain to this short life only, the glory is eternal.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.680]   And that means, verse 13 again, that even in this life you can keep on rejoicing and
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:57.460]   at the revelation of His glory, you can rejoice with exultation.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:04.040]   Or as the New International Version has it, you can be overjoyed when His glory is revealed.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.680]   I love that.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:11.600]   Now notice the twin themes, suffering and glory, those are Peter's twin themes throughout
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.120]   this epistle, and of course those are common themes throughout the New Testament.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.080]   Suffering is a necessary prelude to glory.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:26.240]   Christ suffered for us, and therefore if we hope to have a share in His glory, we must
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.840]   also partake in the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   Yea, and all who live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.920]   And Peter's counsel to these suffering saints is intensely practical.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:52.720]   And to most, it will seem counterintuitive, because the response Peter calls for here
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.400]   is not the natural reflex response for any of us.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:04.440]   This epistle is full of encouragements for those troubled saints to be full of joy, to
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.840]   be patient, to be thankful, even to be submissive.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.000]   Bear the insults and the injustices of your tormentors and do it patiently.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.480]   And verse 12, "Do not be surprised, it's not as though some strange thing were happening
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   to you."
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.780]   Verse 13, "You are sharing the sufferings of Christ, so keep on rejoicing."
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:34.080]   Verse 14, "You are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests on you."
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.800]   And verse 19, "Entrust your souls to a faithful Creator."
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.360]   Now remember, he's writing to sojourners and exiles, people who have been dispossessed
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.760]   of home and comfort.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.240]   They're literally outcasts.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:56.680]   They're persecuted people seeking refuge, but still living under intense hostility from
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.460]   the culture all around them.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.160]   The conventional wisdom of our generation would encourage them to make the most of their
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:12.280]   victim status, you know, milk it for political advantage, protest and demonstrate and demand
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:18.620]   reparations and fight for social justice and rise up and devote your energies to political
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:23.740]   and legislative remedies, perhaps even retaliate.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:31.820]   Pick up arms to resist the tyrants and put a swift end to this systemic injustice.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.940]   And in fact, he does notice, he does start this chapter by saying, "Arm yourselves."
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:43.460]   But what he's saying is this, "Prepare your minds and your hearts to suffer.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.740]   Equip yourselves with the same resolve Christ took to the cross.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:54.180]   Since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same purpose."
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:00.680]   And verse 12, "Do not be surprised by the fiery trial, and don't be indignant or bitter
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.940]   when you're called to suffer as though some strange thing was happening to you."
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:12.700]   All of that is totally contrary to the spirit of the culture all around us, and it wasn't
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.540]   much different in Peter's time.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.420]   Believers in our generation really need to learn this and take it to heart.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:28.100]   You know, believers today are routinely told that the church needs to change its strategy
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.940]   in order to avert the hostility of the world.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:37.540]   Some say we need to, you know, edit and adapt our message, contextualize, cater to the felt
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:43.180]   needs of the unchurched, soften the tone, don't tell people they're sinners and they
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.680]   won't hate you as much.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:52.480]   You know, winsomeness is the key to avoiding persecution and gaining the approval and affirmation
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:59.580]   of the world, even if that means you have to censor the hard parts of the gospel message.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.580]   And that's, I would say, actually the dominant evangelical strategy, and it's been that way
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.460]   for decades.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.260]   And it has clearly failed.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:17.860]   So now we have this growing chorus of other evangelical voices proposing that, no, the
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:24.020]   church should get aggressive and openly antagonistic with the world and we should endeavor to commandeer
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.500]   the reins of power away from Caesar.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:34.120]   They want the church to use the machinery of statecraft and use our collective political
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.860]   clout to build the kingdom of Christ on earth through the force of law and government, and
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.300]   I suppose if it becomes necessary even with military might.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.960]   You know, basically they're saying, "Render unto God the things that are Caesar's."
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.660]   But notice, Peter says none of that.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:28:00.780]   Instead, this whole epistle is loaded with exhortations urging these exiled sufferers
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:08.700]   to bear patiently the cross of grief and pain, to rejoice with joy inexpressible and full
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:15.780]   of glory, even while they are being persecuted, to count themselves privileged to suffer for
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:21.500]   Christ's sake, to rejoice that they've been considered worthy to suffer shame for His
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   name.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:29.520]   And he also urges them to lay aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.640]   all slander and to keep their conduct excellent among the Gentiles so that in the thing which
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:44.380]   they slander us as evildoers, they may because of our good works glorify God.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:50.140]   In other words, Peter is concerned about their sanctification, not their lack of political
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.580]   clout.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:58.180]   He writes, 1 Peter 2 verses 11 and 12, "I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:04.120]   from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul by keeping your conduct excellent
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.260]   among the Gentiles so that in the thing that they slander you as evildoers, they may because
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.540]   of your good works as they observe them glorify God."
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.540]   That's his strategy.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:23.320]   He's saying our best testimony to a hostile world is our sanctification, not our collective
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.460]   political clout.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:31.820]   And furthermore, persecution is not something to rise up and resist.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.820]   It's an instrument by which God blesses and sanctifies us.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:42.060]   Chapter 3 verses 14 and 15, "If you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:49.580]   are blessed and do not fear their fear and do not be troubled, but sanctify Christ as
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.180]   Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:30:00.120]   give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and fear."
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:06.020]   And by the way, Peter is not the least bit interested in to know whether these strangers
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:12.700]   and pilgrims are influencing the arts and entertainment world as they fan out into the
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.540]   Roman Empire.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.020]   He doesn't urge them to try to redeem popular culture.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.940]   He doesn't want them to try to find redemptive themes in Greek drama.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:30.540]   He doesn't hope that they'll learn to use enticing words of man's wisdom in order to
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.300]   win the respect of the leading philosophers of the day.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:40.780]   And he doesn't propose a strategy whereby they might wrest power away from Caesar and
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:46.460]   give it to him so that Peter can rule over Rome as a pope.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:55.660]   To say it bluntly, Peter is not a Christian nationalist and he's not an insurrectionist.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:02.080]   Peter of all people understands that Christ's kingdom is not of this world.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:09.960]   He doesn't respond to this massive wave of unjust government-sponsored persecution by
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.880]   trying to make Christians more militant.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:19.300]   Peter is obviously aware of what Jesus said to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.300]   If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would be fighting.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.640]   But as it is, my kingdom is not from here."
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:33.420]   And to me, this is remarkable, coming from Peter especially because we know that Peter
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:40.320]   as a natural man did have a dose of carnal insurrection in his heart.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.860]   You know, he's the guy who cut off Malchus' ear.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.260]   And the soldiers came to arrest Jesus.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.900]   But this is a different Peter now, with a superior strategy.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:57.540]   As I said already, Peter's counsel sounds counterintuitive to carnal ears.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:04.780]   You know, he exhorts these persecuted exiles, suffering mistreatment and intimidation and
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.460]   contempt, and sometimes even torture and death.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.940]   He exhorts them, 1 Peter 2, 13 through 15, to be subject for the sake of the Lord to
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:19.980]   every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.540]   sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do good.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:31.140]   For such is the will of God that by doing good you may silence the ignorance of foolish
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.140]   men.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.900]   "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's."
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:41.940]   Paul gave the same instructions, of course, in Romans 13, "Be in subjection to the governing
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.940]   authorities.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.700]   For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist have been appointed
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.380]   by God."
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:54.620]   And this is not as confusing as our generation has made it out to be, you know?
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:33:04.940]   When Caesar acts within the sphere wherein he has rightful authority, submit, obey, show
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:12.660]   respect to the office even if the ruler who occupies it is a fiend like Nero or a half-wit
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:18.420]   like some of the government officials we live under.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:25.500]   Now we know, don't we, that Peter holds firmly to the principle that when there is a conflict
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:32.420]   between that which is Caesar's and that which is God's, we must obey God rather than men.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.380]   He's not going to forsake the assembling of the saints, or he's not going to stop singing
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:43.100]   hymns of praise just because some government official tells him he has to.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:49.780]   And when he gets sent to prison for worshiping a God whom Caesar despises, Peter continues
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.520]   singing praise, even in prison.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.300]   He's not living by the sword anymore.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.940]   He's not slicing off the ear of the captain of the guard.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.700]   And as he writes this epistle, years after that night in the garden when he brandished
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:13.500]   his sword against Malchus, now the persecution of the saints has attained almost an apocalyptic
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   ferocity.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.700]   It's worse.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:23.540]   He could see clearly how bad things were for these Christians and for Peter himself.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.700]   Chapter 4, verse 7, "The end of all things is at hand."
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.100]   So what should these suffering saints do?
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.060]   Arm themselves for Armageddon?
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:42.300]   Organize a protest march on Palatine Hill or hold a rally in the Roman Forum?
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.960]   No.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:53.260]   Peter says, "Therefore, be of sound thinking and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:58.020]   Tie your mind with the truth and devote your heart to prayer."
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.940]   That's his remedy.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:06.900]   That answer wouldn't be very satisfying to the average evangelical activist today.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:13.040]   But Peter had taken to heart the words of Jesus, "Blessed are those who have been persecuted
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.020]   for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:22.700]   Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.780]   evil against you because of me.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:31.060]   Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great."
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:37.340]   And Peter wants to remind these scattered saints of that blessed beatitude.
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:42.280]   He sums up the message in our passage, and so now I want to look at this passage point
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.280]   by point.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:50.420]   I see five imperatives that are either stated or implied in these eight verses, and I want
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.700]   to point them out to you.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.380]   Five simple imperatives.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:36:00.340]   The first is this, be ready...be ready, verse 12, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.940]   trial among you which comes upon you for your testing as though some strange thing were
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.940]   happening to you."
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:13.660]   This is contrary, by the way, to much of the American evangelical experience.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:18.860]   We tend to think that persecution is some kind of anomaly in the Christian life.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.860]   It's not.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.940]   It's what normal Christians have always experienced.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.380]   This is what is normal.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:33.420]   As long as we live in this world as strangers and aliens, we're citizens of heaven, we're
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:40.780]   slaves of Christ, and none of that fits neatly into the hierarchy of earth's social pecking
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.780]   order.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.180]   It's not supposed to.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:48.540]   Again, as Paul said to Timothy, "All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.620]   suffer persecution."
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:56.700]   Even in our generation, two millennia after Peter wrote this, you realize, I hope, that
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:04.700]   the trajectory of this world's constant spiritual decline is following the pattern Paul outlines
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:10.340]   in Romans 1 and it is a descent into deeper and deeper depravity.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.440]   And friends, it's going to get worse.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:20.060]   If you're alert at all, you ought to be able to see signs that suggest the persecution
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.820]   of Christians is going to intensify.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:31.240]   And in fact, if you count the statistics worldwide right now, the truth is, persecution of Christians
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.900]   today is worse than it's ever been.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:42.100]   Did you realize that in the 20th century alone, more Christians died for their faith than
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:46.460]   in all of the previous 19 centuries combined?
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.460]   That's a fact.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.620]   Ted Johnson, who's a professor of global Christianity and mission at Gordon-Conwell Theological
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:58.740]   Seminary says it like this, quote, "More than 70 million Christians have been martyred over
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:05.160]   the last two millennia," that's more than half of them died in the 20th century under
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.120]   fascist and communist regimes.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:14.780]   He says, "We also estimate that one million Christians were killed between 2001 and 2010,
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:22.100]   and about 900,000 were killed from 2011 to 2020."
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.620]   It's getting worse.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:29.700]   Now we live in a kind of cocoon in North America where the threat of dying for our faith doesn't
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.180]   seem all that imminent.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.460]   And meanwhile, we ignore what's happening worldwide.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:42.040]   But Christians are currently being killed for their faith by the thousands in Nigeria
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.500]   and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in other places in Africa.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:53.020]   We don't hear about it from the mainstream media, but Google it and you'll see dozens
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.540]   of news items about the slaughter there.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:02.580]   Last Christmas, just this recent Christmas, 100 believers were killed in Nigeria because
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.380]   they refused to recant their faith on Christmas.
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.660]   At that time, I tweeted a news item about it from the New York Post, and that article
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:19.060]   in the New York Post opened with this sentence, quote, "A never-ending massacre of Christians
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:26.460]   being killed for sport is reportedly happening in Nigeria, yet the world appears to be largely
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.820]   deaf to the matter."
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:35.020]   It's a sad state of affairs, really, when the New York Post is more aware of the mass
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.780]   slaughter of Christians than most of the churches in America.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.980]   But that is the current state of this world's contempt for Christ.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:50.260]   And despite all of the clever strategies of stylish American megachurches on the one hand
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:58.140]   and this evangelical political activism on the other hand, despite all of that, this
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:04.780]   world's contempt for Christ is speedily getting worse, not better.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:10.420]   And Scripture gives us every reason to think it's going to continue in that vein.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:16.340]   Now if you're a post-millennialist, you're going to say, "That sounds like eschatological
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.180]   pessimism."
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.180]   But it's not.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.300]   You know, we believe truth triumphs.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.700]   That's the theme of our conference.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:31.620]   Truth triumphs not by the wisdom of this world or the scheming and politicking and social
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.620]   leverage of mere mortals.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:40.260]   And in fact, just right after he says, "All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:47.300]   be persecuted," the Apostle Paul adds this, "Evil men and impostors will proceed from
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:52.220]   bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:58.300]   You can call that pessimistic, and it might sound that way to those who rely on horses
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:04.320]   and trust in chariots, or to those who think large armies of people wielding political
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.820]   power are going to be necessary for the truth to triumph, or to anyone who thinks that righteousness
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.860]   comes through the Law.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:19.460]   If any of those ideas are the key strategy you have in mind for winning the world, it's
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:25.100]   true that large portions of biblical eschatology are going to sound pessimistic.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:32.540]   But as I've said more than once, I'm not a pessimist, I'm a Calvinist.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.300]   Greta Thunberg is a pessimist.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.580]   I'm not.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.500]   Calvinists can't be pessimistic because we know that God is still sovereign.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.460]   He is always in control.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:53.580]   He always works all things together for good, and His truth will triumph in due time.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.940]   That's a certainty.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.700]   God's inerrant, infallible Word says so.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:01.740]   There's no room for pessimism there.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:10.100]   Now let me be clear, I am totally and enthusiastically in favor of voting for laws insofar as possible,
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:18.100]   also electing candidates with values that reflect the influence of biblical principles.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.420]   Candidates like that seem almost non-existent today.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:28.360]   But I am not in favor of thinking that that's the key strategy by which the church can remedy
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.900]   what's wrong with human society because if righteousness comes through the law, then
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.420]   Christ died needlessly.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.380]   The gospel is the power of God for salvation.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.940]   Truth triumphs not because Christians expend all their resources and energies to elect
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.780]   the right political candidates.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:54.740]   Truth triumphs because Christ is Lord, and He who is called faithful and true will strike
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.500]   down the nations and He will rule them with a rod of iron.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:05.660]   And He'll accomplish that victory with a two-edged sword that proceeds out of His mouth, not
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.980]   by a proxy who sits in the oval office.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:16.020]   Which is to say, in this time of political turmoil with an overabundance of zeal coming
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:26.060]   from every corner of Caesar's realm, 21st century evangelicals need to adjust our expectations.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:33.900]   We need to stand athwart the winds of culture as society rushes headlong into those judgments
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.940]   that Paul describes in Romans 1.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:44.420]   But earthly strategies designed to turn aside this world's hatred for Jesus, those are all
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.260]   a vain hope.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:52.220]   You don't improve the effectiveness of our testimony or the efficacy of the gospel by
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:58.860]   dressing the church up in the latest fashions, or by cultivating an obsession with academic
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:06.180]   prestige, or by campaigning for political clout, or by pretending that we are paragons
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:13.180]   of cultural savvy, or by using any other strategy to curry favor or seek friendship with the
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.180]   world.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.260]   The world is enmity with God.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:25.460]   And persecution is inevitable, Scripture says, if we seek to live godly lives in an ungodly
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.460]   culture.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.220]   "Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you."
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:35.300]   Jesus said, "If the world hates you, know that it hated Me first.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.580]   If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:43.180]   But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.540]   the world hates you.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.460]   Remember the word that I said to you, a slave is not greater than his master.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:54.260]   If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you."
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.380]   That's John 15 verses 18 through 20.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:02.620]   Or back to our text, "Do not be surprised as though some strange thing were happening
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.020]   to you."
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.020]   Persecution is inevitable, be ready.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.420]   Imperative number two, be glad, verses 13 and 14.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:17.660]   But to the degree you are sharing the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing so that also
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.740]   at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:26.740]   If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.300]   and of God rests on you.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:32.420]   Now again, this is counterintuitive counsel.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.420]   When you're persecuted, be glad.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:43.340]   But Peter is only repeating here what he heard Jesus preach, Luke 6, 22 and 23, "Blessed
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:48.500]   are you when men hate you and exclude you and insult you and scorn your name as evil
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.380]   for the sake of the Son of Man.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:55.620]   Be glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.620]   For their fathers were doing the same things to the prophets.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.980]   Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.780]   is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:14.740]   One of the great birthrights every Christian inherits is the ability to rejoice always.
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:20.580]   In Colossians 1:24, Paul says, "I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and I fill
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.180]   up what is lacking of Christ's afflictions in my flesh."
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:30.060]   And that verse is often misread and sometimes mistranslated.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.580]   The ESV and the New American Standard Bible both have Paul saying, "I am filling up what
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:41.980]   is lacking in Christ's afflictions," as if he's doing something to the once-for-all sacrifice...he's
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.620]   adding something to the once-for-all sacrifice that Christ made.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.100]   But that's not the point.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:54.060]   Nothing whatsoever was lacking in Christ's afflictions that Paul or anyone else needed
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.340]   to compensate for.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.740]   But you read it carefully.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.140]   Here's the Legacy Standard Bible again.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:05.460]   "I fill up what is lacking of Christ's afflictions in my flesh."
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:11.200]   In other words, Paul is...by suffering for the sake of the church and suffering in the
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:18.020]   name of Christ, Paul is entering more fully into the fellowship of Christ's sufferings,
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.420]   being conformed to His death.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.180]   He's filling up what he lacks, not something that Christ lacked.
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.300]   And that's a reason to rejoice and be glad when we are persecuted.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:31.940]   We are entering into the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:39.100]   And nothing is more Christ-like, nothing does more to conform us to the likeness of Christ
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:44.820]   than when we suffer and bear it gladly, which is precisely what Peter has in mind right
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:50.620]   there in the text when he says we should rejoice and be glad when we're persecuted.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.860]   We are sharing the sufferings of Christ, he says.
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:59.340]   And furthermore, Peter says that that joy that we have even in the midst of our suffering
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:05.420]   will be multiplied by infinity at the revelation of Christ's glory.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:11.420]   And the knowledge that this is what the future holds, that should be enough to make any Christian
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:12.700]   glad.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:18.260]   Frankly, that's precisely what keeps me from being pessimistic.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.340]   Here's another reason to be glad, verse 14, "Because the spirit of glory and of God rests
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.500]   on you."
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.700]   So if you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:33.380]   It's actually a token of God's favor.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.140]   So be ready, be glad.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.020]   Here's a third imperative from our text, be steadfast.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:44.140]   Verses 15 and 16, "Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or a thief or an
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.200]   evildoer or a troublesome meddler.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:52.500]   But if anyone suffers as a Christian, he's not to be put to shame, but is to glorify
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.980]   God in this name."
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:59.060]   Now I have to abbreviate these last three points in order to make sure I don't go over
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.060]   time.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:04.580]   But this one, this one is vital to Peter's argument.
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:12.020]   Again, the way he wants them to convey their message to the world is not by marches and
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:17.960]   demonstrations or any other of the common tools of protest and political activism.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:24.500]   But instead, he wants them to answer the world's contempt by putting their sanctification on
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.760]   display.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.460]   And it's okay, it's more than okay.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:38.020]   It's a divinely bestowed blessing to suffer as a Christian for Christ's sake, to suffer
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.940]   in the name of Christ and for His honor and glory.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:47.220]   There is frankly no higher privilege than to suffer as a Christian.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:51.460]   This is true triumph, to glorify God in this name.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:56.420]   In other words, thank God that you bear Christ's name.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.700]   If people cause you to suffer because you're called a Christian, be thankful that you have
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.780]   that name.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:09.420]   And so, be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:15.000]   that your labor is not in vain in the Lord, your suffering is not in vain either.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.120]   Glorify God for it.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:24.660]   So follow the logic of these imperatives, be ready, be glad, be steadfast.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.360]   Number four, be humble.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:34.600]   Persecution is not only a blessing, it's also a tool by which God proves and purifies and
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.260]   strengthens the church.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.840]   And that's what Peter means by the word "judgment" in verse 17.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:47.780]   What he has in mind might entail an element of fatherly discipline, but it doesn't imply
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.940]   even a hint of condemnation.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:56.300]   Romans 8, 1, there's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:02.180]   But nevertheless, there is a need for testing and strengthening and even correcting the
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.660]   church.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.140]   And the church is what Peter means when he speaks of the household of God.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:13.780]   Remember verse 17, "It is time for judgment to begin with the house of God and if it begins
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:19.140]   with us first, what will be the outcome of those who do not obey the gospel of God?
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:23.780]   And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become of the godless
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.180]   man and the sinner?"
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.600]   Now what does this mean?
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:33.100]   It is with difficulty that the righteous is saved.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:40.260]   Understand, he is not suggesting that God has a hard time saving us, though in all candor
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:46.400]   as I peer into my own heart, I have to confess to my shame that I haven't always made it
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:51.220]   easy for the Spirit of God to conform me to Christ's likeness.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.180]   But that's not what Peter is saying here.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:52:00.260]   He's saying that if life is hard for the redeemed, if honoring Christ and following Him always
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:07.020]   entails taking up a cross and suffering, if it always subjects the saints to persecution
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:12.680]   and anguish and hardships and even death at the hands of the wicked, if it's that bad
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:21.540]   for us, how much more severe will God's final judgment be for the godless man and the sinner?
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:25.700]   And if you realize all of that, what should that compel you to do?
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:34.180]   It should compel you to be humble and sober-minded and zealous for the salvation of the lost.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:40.780]   It's quite a humbling realization when we see that even for redeemed people on the scale
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:48.540]   of what we actually deserve, persecution isn't really a cosmic injustice.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:53.340]   It's a tool that God providentially uses for our sanctification.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:59.720]   It's literally a means by which He brings us into an eternal triumph, an eternal glory
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.780]   that frankly we don't deserve.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:08.780]   And Peter is going to underscore this principle in chapter 5 verse 5 when he says, "Clothe
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:14.820]   yourselves with humility, for God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble."
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.780]   Gird yourself with humility.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.900]   I love that expression, gird yourself with humility.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:26.020]   There's no doubt thinking of that night when Christ girded Himself with a towel and washed
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.860]   Peter's feet.
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:36.580]   That was Christ on the eve of His death facing persecution with humility.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.580]   That's our example.
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:47.620]   So be ready, be glad, be steadfast, be humble, and now fifth and finally, be faithful, verse
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.620]   19.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.500]   "Therefore those also who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:57.440]   to a faithful Creator in doing good."
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.820]   You serve a faithful God.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.740]   So be faithful in doing good.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.060]   That needs very little exposition here.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:10.640]   Nothing I could say could improve on what John MacArthur said yesterday anyway.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.540]   So I'll just leave it at that.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:18.860]   Be faithful, as Jesus said to the church at Smyrna, "The devil is about to cast some of
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:24.460]   you into prison so that you will be tested and you will have tribulation for days.
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:29.500]   Be faithful unto death and I will give you the crown of life."
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.140]   Be faithful, brethren.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.980]   And let me say one other thing in closing.
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:40.620]   There is nothing elegant or impressive about suffering persecution.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:49.080]   I mean, even if you follow all five of these imperatives, it won't win you many accolades.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.940]   Paul suffered so much that no one but Luke even wanted to be closely associated with
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.940]   him anymore.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:55:03.180]   And in fact, suffering itself is a powerful reminder that we should never regard the Christian
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:09.300]   faith purely or even predominantly as an academic matter.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.580]   It's not merely an academic matter.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:18.940]   Ever since the Puritan era ended, the quest for academic respectability and an illicit
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:27.820]   craving for academic honors and intellectual status has actually undermined the faith and
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.240]   weakened the testimony of the church.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:40.220]   On the other hand, persecution, if it's well-received, is a powerful practical affirmation and an
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:47.200]   unanswerable testimony to the world that our faith is real, that the gospel is true, that
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:53.140]   heaven's glory will ultimately triumph over all the evils of this world.
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:56:00.140]   May God give us grace no longer to live in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.140]   will of God.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.740]   Let us pray.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:12.220]   Father, we confess that our natural instincts run contrary to every admonition contained
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.700]   in this passage.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:23.440]   Give us grace to respond to this world's contempt with pure Christ-like grace and steadfastness
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:30.320]   and humility, and grant us wisdom to see and to embrace with a whole heart the reality
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.680]   that it is truly a blessing to suffer for Christ's name.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:41.680]   May we live by that name, may we glorify you in that name, and may we live lives that truly
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.500]   honor that name.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.840]   In the name of Jesus, we pray, amen.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.340]   Amen.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:46.840]   Amen.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:56.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
