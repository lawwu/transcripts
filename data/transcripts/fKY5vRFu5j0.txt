[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   [music]
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.760]   We have received quite a few emails on cussing and why it's a sin to let a
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.440]   four-letter word rip every once in a while. Why or why not is this a sin, Pastor John? And
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.640]   is there any difference if it's a word directed at a person calling someone a name or just out
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.800]   loud in response to a circumstance like hitting your thumb with a hammer? What would you say?
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.080]   Okay, these are questions, this kind of question is the sort of thing parents have to deal with
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:43.360]   because we all have to set standards for our kids and I think kids soon, not late, soon
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.400]   need to have reasons for the standards that you set for them. Like we don't say that in this
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.120]   family. Well, why don't we say it? And we need reason. So here's some of my thoughts about
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:09.520]   language. First, there's a whole category of the misuse of important realities. I'm thinking God,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:20.160]   Jesus Christ, damn, and hell. Let's take those four. I think the Bible is pretty clear and pretty
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.440]   explicit when it says don't take the name of the Lord in vain, that God as a throwaway word,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:36.160]   or Jesus Christ as a word of "I just hit my finger," or "something just terrible happened," or
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.440]   "damn" as a swear word, or "hell" as a throwaway swear word. The problem with all those is that
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:52.880]   they take things that are unbelievably important, serious, and they turn them into moments of
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.200]   smallness. There's a disconnect. There's a lack of coherence and harmony between the way they're
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.960]   being used and the weight that they should carry. If a person uses God and Jesus Christ and damn
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:16.880]   and hell as a throwaway standard expression of irritation or anger, he is belittling God,
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.720]   belittling Christ, belittling the serious of damnation, and belittling hell, and we ought not
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.400]   to belittle these big, big things. So that's my first take. Second, there's a whole category in
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.440]   the Bible and in English language called crude, crass, vulgar, indecent. Those words didn't come
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.160]   out of nowhere. Those words are invented because human beings in every culture have felt certain
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.000]   things are inappropriate. Every culture has something that they view as offensive, or we
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   have this word "off-color," or we have the word "rude." Now a person might ask, "Well, is there a
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.520]   biblical category for that stuff?" And the answer is a resounding "yes." I was talking about this
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   just the other day, maybe two weeks ago, a week and a half ago, with the guys over at Bethlehem
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.120]   Seminary about the category of this kind of ethics, and here's a couple of texts. In 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.680]   "Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant or rude."
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:36.560]   Rude. Now, "rude" is in the King James translated, "does not behave itself unseemly."
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.800]   Now that word "unseemly," that's an old-fashioned word. Hardly anybody uses it today,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:50.560]   but we all know what that means. There are things that are inappropriate. They're dishonorable.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.720]   They're disgraceful. They're indecent. So the Bible says, "Be aware in the culture where you are
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:08.320]   not to offend unnecessarily against what is broadly considered rude." Or here's another one,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:20.160]   Ephesians 5, 4, "Let there be no filthiness, nor foolish talk, nor crude joking, which are,"
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   and then you get this phrase, "out of place," "unfitting." The Greek is "anakin," but instead,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.880]   "Let there be thanksgiving." So Paul knew that there were a hundred decisions you'd have to make
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.360]   in life for which you couldn't consult a list. There's no list that's going to work for when
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.600]   something is inappropriately crude, or foolish talk, or filthiness. And so he's saying, "But
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:56.480]   there is a category, and Christians should not want their language to be crossing over those lines
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.240]   again and again." And right there at the end of that verse is a third thought. So the first thought
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.440]   was taking big, weighty, glorious things and belittling them, and speaking as though they
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.960]   weren't important. And the second thought is there's a biblical category for unseemliness,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.120]   and inappropriateness, and rude, and crude, and foolish, and filthy, and Christians ought not to
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.960]   want that. Here's a third idea. At the end of that verse there that I quoted from Ephesians 5, it
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:35.280]   says, "But instead, let there be thanksgiving," which I think means that Paul thought if your
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:46.400]   heart is right and brimming with gratitude to God in all things, that will be a monitor on the kind
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.160]   of crudeness that comes out of your mouth. People that tend to use a lot of four-letter words, a lot
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.720]   of scatological talk, a lot of harsh, crude, rough, crass talk, are generally sounding pretty angry.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:11.360]   They're not content. They're not happy in Jesus. Something's out of whack in their heart. So I
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.280]   think a third major issue is, is your heart right? Are these things coming out of a good heart?
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:27.600]   Which leads to one last comment. What is it? Ephesians 4, verse 29, "Let no corrupting talk,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:36.960]   no foul talk, come out of your mouths, but only what is good for building up, as fits the occasion,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.040]   that it may give grace to those who hear." So here you have Paul explicitly moving beyond
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:50.480]   gratitude in my heart, which I think is going to wash away most of the crude stuff, but he's saying,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:58.400]   "Let your language always be good for people." And what he means by good for people is minister
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.360]   grace for them. So you should ask, if you're about to say some four-letter word, or for some harsh and
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.760]   ugly thing that's kind of dirty, is it going to be good for people? Is it going to build them up? Is
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.920]   it going to make them stronger? Is it going to make Christ more beautiful in their eyes? So
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.320]   those are general thoughts. Let me see if I can sum them up. Let me try. One, don't debase and
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:32.160]   cheapen great reality. Number two, does it come under the category of culturally recognized,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:41.840]   crude, off-color, vulgar, offensive? Three, does it reveal a bitter, overly angry, dissatisfied
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:49.600]   rather than thankful heart? And four, does it minister grace to those who hear? We liveâ€”you
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:57.840]   and I both, Tony, know we cherish Christ and the gospel above all, and that should mean that grace
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.440]   is abounding in our hearts, and most of the language that is offensive and questionable
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.840]   is simply contrary to ministering grace and living out of grace.
