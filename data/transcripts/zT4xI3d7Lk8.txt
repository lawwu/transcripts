[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (slow hip hop music)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.300]   - Man, here another episode of Curious Mike,
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.120]   here my big bro B-Roy.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.980]   You know, Kobe said his dude was the hardest player
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.100]   he ever had to guard.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.700]   I had the pleasure of playing for this dude in Nathan Hale.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.140]   He taught me a lot, he's been a big bro to me since.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.980]   So I appreciate you being on the show, my brother.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.540]   - Oh yeah, no doubt, thanks for having me on the show.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.580]   - You already know.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.800]   So we're gonna start out in the NBA,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.780]   just 'cause that's obviously where most people know you from.
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.240]   And I grew up watching you, idolizing you.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.080]   So we're gonna start up there,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.980]   then we'll kind of move to some other stuff.
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.800]   Man, so yeah, I wanna, first off,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.220]   I just wanna ask you about your favorite players.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.780]   Who was your, like your time, who was the best players
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.500]   that you played against in your area?
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.080]   - Yeah, so my area meaning?
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.420]   - Like your era, your era.
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.720]   - Yeah, well, I guess I'll start with first,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.800]   you have the names that are like LeBron James,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.640]   you know what I mean?
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.700]   Him are a class apart, so.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.420]   - So already back then, he was like--
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.040]   - Well, I never played against him,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.060]   but hearing about him and just hearing the legend
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.700]   of LeBron James, it's like, okay, is he that good?
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.820]   So when I first seen him, I went, damn,
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.820]   he is the best player.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   It's not that you say, oh, I'm gonna concede to this guy,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.600]   but watching him, he was that good at an early age,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.360]   and I think that kids kind of get that misunderstood.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.920]   And I think I told you, I'm like,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760]   you're one of the best players I've seen since a LeBron.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.440]   That doesn't come around often with size,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.360]   handle it, shoot it at a young age.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.920]   So he was off top, the best kid when we were in high school,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.080]   and then another guy that was big was Carmelo Anthony.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.600]   He's the next dude you always hear about.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.440]   And again, like I said--
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.560]   - So you was the same age as those guys.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.720]   - Well, yeah, we're the same age,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.040]   but we're a class of, me and Carmelo are a class of 2002,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.800]   and Bron is 2003.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   - Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.560]   - So I think Melo might be 37, I'm 37, Bron's 36.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   So yeah, so we're all in that same,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.200]   I would say, era of guys.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.080]   And Melo, and then CP3, them dudes are all that good.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.840]   - Right there. - Ramy Feldman, those are,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.800]   again, so when I get a list of my era,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.840]   I always try to go with,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.480]   okay, those are the dudes that's in the league,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.640]   you know who they are, they've been good
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.160]   pretty much their entire life.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   But then, locally, I've always had really good battles with,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.800]   you found out coming to Seattle,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.440]   Rainier Beach High School's a big high school,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.840]   so I had battles with Logic Stewart, Roderick Stewart,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080]   twin brothers, Nate Robinson went there.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.000]   So we battled, another cat that went to
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.480]   Franklin High School, Anthony Grant, he's really good.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.080]   Then you got, my brother was always the hardest player
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.040]   I'd rather play against.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.880]   - Your brother?
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.360]   - Yeah, my older brother.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.560]   - He would beat you one-on-one?
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.520]   - Yup, yup.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.040]   - That's just the older brother thing, though.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.200]   - Yeah, you know, you play, I see you and Tay play,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.520]   it's kinda like the big brother has that slight mental edge.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.840]   So, those are all dudes that I always looked up to,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.720]   admired playing against, competing against,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.280]   and again, to this day, they're the ones that push me
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.520]   to always wanna keep getting better,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.880]   'cause you're always hearing about them,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.360]   and seeing what they're doing.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.760]   And then it's like, all right, I wanna try to make sure
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.840]   I stay on that level.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.000]   - Right, so then, you didn't mention Kobe,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.120]   so he was obviously a little older,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.520]   but how much older was he than you?
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   And I was gonna ask you, what is your favorite Kobe story?
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.680]   - Yeah, so with Kobe, now that's, you know,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.040]   I always start with Michael Jordan as my favorite
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.360]   sports figure, greatest athlete ever.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.040]   But what was really cool about Kobe was,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.640]   he eventually became my second,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.480]   because when I got introduced to basketball,
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.840]   it was like, Jordan, you know, he's at the top.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.880]   But when Kobe came into the league in '96,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.280]   I'm like, okay, damn, he plays like Jordan, but he young.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.800]   - Yeah. - And he kinda cool,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.560]   and more fitting, you know, the age group
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.720]   and the popularity of how we wanna do things.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.440]   - Right. - He had the little baby fro,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.560]   and you know, I'm getting to high school,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.640]   I got the baby fro now, you know, so it was like,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.320]   Jordan was the guy I idolized,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.080]   and then it moved into Kobe.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.040]   But it was cool, because I always try to play like Jordan,
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.720]   you know, footwork, pump fakes, fade away,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.840]   and Kobe was doing it too.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.840]   So now I'm going into it like,
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.520]   damn, so now my second favorite player plays
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.240]   just like my favorite player, but he's younger,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.880]   and I can relate to him more, you know, it's like,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.360]   you know, you watch the shows like Moesha growing up,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.520]   and then Kobe go to, you know, you see him
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.800]   and Brandy going to prom, and it's like,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.520]   damn, this is all my, this is all the stuff I'm into.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.080]   When Jordan was, you know, he was older and more mature
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.280]   and doing different things, so that was real,
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.120]   that was real dope, and then, yeah, ever since then,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.640]   he's just always been the guy that I idolize
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   watching and playing basketball.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.720]   So, you know, I would say my favorite Kobe story
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.800]   was when I was in Portland, and we had a win streak
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.120]   against the Lakers in the Rose Garden.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.600]   So, you know, I got hurt, and leading up into this game,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.920]   Kobe sprains his ankle, you know.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.120]   I mean, I wouldn't say it then,
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   but I used to watch Laker games, you know,
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.120]   it's just as much as, you know, playing,
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.440]   it's like, all right, now I gotta,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.520]   I record my DVR of my Laker games,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.480]   'cause, you know, Kobe was still my favorite player,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.320]   but I didn't want anybody to think that he had an edge on me
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.160]   because I did like him so much as a player.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.400]   So, you know, we're getting ready for the game,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.840]   and, you know, they asked me, am I gonna play,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.040]   and I was just like, nah, it's just not ready yet.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.440]   I think it's my hamstring, and, you know,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.160]   Kobe was like, gonna play if I was gonna,
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.800]   if I was gonna suit up, he was gonna play,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.880]   and I was like, no way, he hurt his ankle too bad.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.920]   - So, like, if you was gonna play,
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.200]   he was gonna play? - He was gonna play, yes.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.040]   - How did you know that?
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.000]   - Yeah, so, we'll get to it.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.320]   So, you know, long story short,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.680]   they ended up scratching Kobe,
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.320]   and they're like, all right, he's not gonna play.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.440]   You know, they do that stuff on ESPN,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.960]   and then our little pack is like,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.160]   we don't know if he's gonna play or not.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.040]   So, we're gonna prepare as if he is
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.840]   and go over the Kobe sets and how they're gonna play.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.560]   So, I was like, nah, I'm still about a week away.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.960]   So, I put it out there early, and then, you know,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.360]   he's obviously in the other locker room.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.040]   You know, we know he's in the arena.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.760]   Every camera follows him in.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.440]   So, I'm in the training, doing all my stuff,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.720]   and then I go back to the locker room,
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.400]   and I had a friend of mine, Chuck,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.840]   he works with Nike, and then he worked with Kobe.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.320]   I was like, is Kobe gonna play?
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   He was like, if you play, he's playing.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.560]   I'm like, I'm not playing.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.400]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.240]   He was like, all right.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.320]   He said, nah, I don't think he's gonna play.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.160]   So, I was like, all right, cool.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.840]   I said, ask Kobe when the team's about to warm up.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.360]   Can I come down and say what's up?
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.560]   He was like, all right.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.680]   So, long story short, Chuck didn't come back
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   in the first quarter.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.760]   So, he came back in the second quarter,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.760]   and he was like, Kobe said, yeah, come down there,
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   but wait 'til the teams go out and come after halftime.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.720]   So, I was like, for real?
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.760]   So, I'm getting all nervous.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   Like, I played against him,
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.840]   but we never talked during the game.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.560]   You know, he'd just be going at me.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.920]   So, I was like, for real?
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.760]   He was like, yeah.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.840]   He was like, he said come down,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.240]   but let the teams go out.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.960]   So, I'm like, all right.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.880]   So, the teams, you know,
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.080]   Nate come in and give his speech.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.320]   Both teams go out, and I'm walking up to the locker room.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.400]   I'm like, damn, so what I'm gonna say to Kobe?
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.160]   So, I'm all nervous, and I walk all the way down the hallway,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.800]   and then I get to the door,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.160]   and I'm kind of listening in,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.040]   and I like tap to knock on the locker room door,
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.160]   and the trainer was like, who is it?
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.000]   And I peek in my head, and I was like,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.240]   oh, it's B-Roy, and Kobe was laying on the table.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.600]   Like, he was fully dressed.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.960]   He had his whole warm-ups on, everything.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.800]   He was laying on the table getting stretched,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.120]   and the dude was like doing something to his ankle.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.440]   But, so I'm like, oh, man, it's like Kobe.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.760]   So, he hops up off the table,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.360]   and he's like, B-Roy, come here.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.760]   And I went to dap him, and he like gave me like a bear hug,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.600]   and I was just like, this is Kobe.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.440]   And then I like loosened up,
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.080]   and he's like, how you doing, man?
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.360]   So, I ended up sitting down.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.640]   Like I said, he's laying on the table.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.440]   I sit like in the little locker,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.840]   and we ended up sitting there talking,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.640]   and you know, joking the whole second half of the game.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.480]   - For real?
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.840]   - And that was, you know, for me,
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.680]   you know, not just because of his passing,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.040]   but that was like, damn, I'm meeting, you know, my idol,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.320]   and I get to hang out with him.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   You know, and talking.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.440]   Man, I asked him everything under the sun.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   You know, I was like,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.640]   so how's your and Michael Jordan's relationship?
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.760]   He's like, me and Mike's cool.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.440]   I'm like, oh, yeah, that's cool, you see.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.200]   But, you know, most people, you know,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.400]   I always try to look at it like I'm in the NBA,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.560]   but I'm still a fan of it.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.400]   - Right.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.240]   - So, you know, I asked stuff that I think my dad would.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.400]   You know, we wanted to, you know, know like,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.640]   how does Kobe tie his shoes?
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.200]   You know, all that stuff was cool.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   And then I even joked, I was like,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.120]   so you really was gonna play?
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.960]   He was like, yeah, if you was gonna play.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.600]   I was like, damn, you are dressed.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.040]   - How old was you at this time?
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.920]   - Man, I was my, that was my third,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   that was my third year in the league.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.760]   So, I made the All-Star game my second year.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.600]   - Right.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.440]   - And it was in New Orleans,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.800]   but Kobe didn't play 'cause he had like a bad thumb.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.960]   And we really didn't talk much.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.520]   Like, I was in awe then of him.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.760]   You know, I mean, we had a few different things
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.840]   where we all did it together as a team.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.680]   But, you know, I remember like getting on a bus
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.160]   and it's like, damn, it's Tim Duncan.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.000]   You know, you're in the West.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.600]   It's like, they're going mellow.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.200]   It's like all these great players.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.800]   Iverson's on the team.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.320]   Shrimp did the next, Shaq's on the team.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.960]   So, it's like all these dudes are idolized.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.080]   But then it was like, okay, where's Kobe?
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.800]   I'm all sitting on the bus, patiently waiting.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.840]   Where's Kobe getting on the bus?
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.040]   So, then Kobe comes and cameras follow.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.880]   He get on the bus.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.840]   I'm like, yeah, that's Kobe.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.640]   So, no, it was cool,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.480]   but we didn't really have a one-on-one conversation.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.320]   - Right.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.240]   - Of course, I was playing well in New Orleans
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.360]   and he was like, man, stop being nice, man.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.200]   Stop being passive.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.920]   Like, you can go be MVP.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.600]   I'm like, MVP of the All-Star game?
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.440]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.320]   And he was telling me to do it.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.960]   And I was like, man, all right, we'll see.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.320]   But that was kind of like the most
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.920]   of our interactions at that point.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.040]   So, then that next year, like I said, when he didn't play,
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.560]   that's when I was able to sit down
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.200]   and have, you know, a real long conversation with him.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.880]   - So, even all the way back then, like dudes in the league,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.000]   it was, there was a lot of really good players,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.360]   but Kobe was respected on a whole 'nother level than like--
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.720]   - Yeah, you know, and it's hard to explain.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.120]   Like, they're all really respected.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.840]   You know, I was just as happy to sit down
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.280]   and, you know, have conversations with Tim Duncan.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.240]   You know, I had watched him, you know, he was in college.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.480]   This was way before you guys was, you know,
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.320]   probably even born.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.680]   But, you know, I watched those dudes
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.200]   'cause we got to build relationships
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.640]   with our favorite players from the college level.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.800]   And that's how we got to know 'em.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.200]   Where you guys are, you guys get idolized a little younger,
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.680]   more like high school.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.360]   Like, I didn't know nothin' about Tim Duncan in high school.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.000]   So, we see Chris Webber and them dudes,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.920]   like we learn 'em from Michigan and the Fab Five.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.520]   You know, and Tim Duncan and those dudes.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   So, that's how we got our celebrity.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.880]   That's how they got their celebrity,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.360]   but that's how we got to know those guys.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.760]   So, it was big, but yeah,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.200]   there was somethin' about Kobe comin' around.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.920]   You know, it was somethin' about him
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.480]   where I seen how like, okay, like, you know,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.880]   this is LeBron, this is Mello,
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.440]   but they're all the same age as me.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   And we all looked up to the same dude.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.480]   Even though they're great, and you know,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.560]   LeBron's MVP and a champion,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.840]   and Mello's one of the top players in the world,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.640]   we're all still like, when we was kids,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.360]   lovin' this dude the same way, just in different areas.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.320]   And you can sense that, I think,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.400]   with bein' around a lot of young dudes.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.960]   You know, 'cause Chris Bosch, all those guys.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.240]   You know, it's all class 2002, three, one.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.600]   And Kobe was like that first dude to really just be,
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.320]   you know, he was cold, but he was also,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.960]   you know, he was that next level of like,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.840]   all right, he goes to private school,
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.480]   but he's gonna go outta high school, you know.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.960]   That whole kinda, you know, he got game type thing.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.680]   Like, yeah, he's really doin' it.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.160]   And he's, you know, all-star, he's rookie,
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.360]   second year, everybody's votin' him.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.960]   So, he was just really that guy that I think a lot of guys
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.240]   my age just really, you know, we loved him.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.760]   - Even your age, but my age too.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.240]   I mean, that's one thing that I like,
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.480]   really wish coulda happened.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.840]   Like, I never got to even meet Kobe.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.040]   I remember I was at the Nike Basketball Academy.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.880]   And Kobe--
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.720]   - You never got to meet him, huh?
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.320]   - He flew in on a private jet.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.160]   And I left that morning before he flew in on the jet.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   So, all my homies got like, you know, Trey, Gary Trent.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.200]   All those guys got the picture with Kobe.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.240]   I never even got to meet him.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.040]   So, I love asking stories about him,
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.960]   'cause that was just like, it was your idol.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.200]   Like, even younger dudes, like,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.240]   he spanned across generations, like his, like.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.920]   So, even for me, I was like one of my favorite players, so.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.040]   - Nah, it was, you'da liked meetin' him too,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.200]   because, you know, I was always worried,
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.360]   'cause on the court, he was like, you know,
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.560]   he'd go after it.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.400]   - Right.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.000]   - So, you know, I'll tell you somethin' that's funny.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.320]   Like, when I was comin' in the draft,
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.280]   I think the Lakers was pickin' like 20th, 21st.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.440]   And I knew I was gonna be a top 10 pick.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.240]   And I told my agent, I'm like, man,
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.280]   I think I'm gonna go to the Lakers.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   You know, I'm gonna play with Kobe.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.960]   And he's like laughin', like, nah, I'm like, I'm serious.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.360]   Like, you know, is there anything we could do?
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.400]   He was like, I mean, I'll call him.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.360]   You wanna work out?
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.040]   And I was like, yeah, I'll work out for the Lakers.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.160]   So, I ended up workin' out for the Lakers
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.840]   my very first workout.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.240]   - For real, 'cause you wanted to play with Kobe.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.080]   - Yeah.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.040]   - And y'all was the same position.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.920]   - Yep, so check it out.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.880]   So, we do the workout, Phil comes in there,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.480]   and he sits on his little Bosio ball,
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.600]   and he's, you know, he's watchin' the workout.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.960]   Craig Hodges ends up workin' me out.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.320]   I was juiced, I'm like, Craig Hodges from the Bulls?
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.080]   So, you know, I was like, man, this is crazy,
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.960]   just bein' in here.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.160]   So, we end up workin' out, and, you know,
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.400]   I'd worked out really well.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.160]   I worked out, I think, with Aaron Oflalo,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   and we ended up goin' up to the back,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.840]   and I met with, you know, Mitch Kupchak and Phil,
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.720]   and they were like, all right, so let's just get to it.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.200]   Like, why are you workin' out for the Lakers?
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.080]   And I was like, man, I think me and Kobe can play together.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.320]   You know, and at that time, that's when the Lakers had,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.640]   you know, lost Shaq, and then the Heat,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.920]   so I was like, man, I gotta get my guy, Kobe, back on top.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.760]   (laughing)
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.600]   - Man, that's crazy.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.040]   - And I never even, I hadn't met him yet at that point,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.920]   but I went to all the Laker games at that playoff series.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.040]   I was there, and he made the shot against Phoenix.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.880]   - For real.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.560]   - And, you know, I was, yeah, my agent's like,
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.640]   man, you know you gotta play 'em next year, right?
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.080]   So you can't be, you can't be sittin' here.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.040]   - Yeah.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.080]   - You know, yellin' and screamin'.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.200]   I wore my Kobe jersey.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.560]   I was like, I'm gonna play 'em if I have to.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.920]   I might be a Laker, you don't know.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.160]   You know, it hurt a lot to hear that he had passed,
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.680]   because he meant a lot, you know, just to me,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   and just basketball, period.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.920]   - Man, I remember when that happened,
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.520]   I was sittin' in the locker room.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.480]   We was about to play a game, they canceled it,
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.640]   and I couldn't believe it.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.480]   - Yeah.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   - So, like, when you, when that quote came out,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.200]   where Kobe, they interview him, and they was like,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.560]   who's the best player, you gotta guard,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.120]   and they said, like, Brandon Roy.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.960]   Do you remember when that was, and like, what year?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.320]   Do you remember what year that was for you?
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.840]   - Yeah, that would've been my third year.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.640]   That would've been my third year.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.040]   I think we was playin' Houston in the playoffs.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.480]   And I'm like, I was happy, 'cause I was like,
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.080]   yeah, Kobe said that, but also, I'm like,
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.960]   man, you puttin' a bullseye on my back,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.520]   with Ron Artest, so.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.800]   - But Ron Artest said it too, though.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.440]   - Yeah, but, you know, I didn't take it, like,
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.000]   in a bad way, I took it like, that's big time.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.760]   And, you know, Portland's in a smaller market,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.880]   so when somebody like Kobe said that,
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.960]   you kinda gotta look up, like, is Brandon Roy
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.800]   really that good?
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.240]   Like, why are these dudes sayin' that about him?
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.000]   And I took it like, I'ma make sure I try to live up to that.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.840]   - Right.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.920]   - But it is a situation where, you know,
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.800]   I'm not a big, you know, media guy,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.160]   to where I do a lot of media stuff, and a lot of promotions.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.720]   So, you know, I remember goin' back east,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.320]   and, you know, the media was like, well, you know,
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   New York fans don't really know who you are,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.440]   and, you know, but a lot of players speak highly of you.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.960]   And I was like, that's fine with me,
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.080]   because I'm not really goin' after the,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.560]   long as when I step between the lines,
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.440]   a guy respects me, or, you know, approves of me,
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.760]   then that's all that really matters.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.080]   But, yeah, no, that was, you know,
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.040]   that was like the icing on the cake, you know, for Kobe.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.480]   It's not often that, I don't care in what profession
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.440]   that, you know, you're in, that, you know,
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.560]   the guy you idol that is at the highest level in the sport,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.840]   gives you, you know, that kind of a compliment.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.600]   So, I definitely knew what he meant by it, you know,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.440]   because, you know, when we talk, you know,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.680]   he's just like, man, you know, you have counters,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.160]   you know, you can tell, you adjust.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   If a guy tried to take this away, you'll do somethin' else.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.480]   And Ron Artest pretty much said the same thing.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.000]   So, I just took it as like, you know,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.440]   validation to a lot of my hard work,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.360]   to always tryin' to go in the gym and get better.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.080]   Because, you know how it is in this game, man.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.640]   Dudes are smart, there's a lot of smart players,
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.320]   there's a lot of smart coaches,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.240]   and they're watchin' you goin',
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.360]   how can we take somethin' from him?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.120]   And I've always tried to keep addin' and addin'.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.480]   As long as my body physically would let me,
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.680]   I thought that, you know, I could, you know,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.920]   just keep improving, because, you know.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.160]   So, that was, that was cool, man.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.640]   I mean, I don't even wanna, it was better than cool,
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.960]   because, you know, I don't think people
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.640]   would really understand how much that meant to me,
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.120]   for him to say that, and to publicly say it.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.840]   Like, you know, like, who's the hardest player?
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.440]   I was like, wow, you know, and then Ron Artest is awesome,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.040]   'cause those are both good defenders.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.880]   - Exactly.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.800]   - Like, you know, I've had my struggles with Ron.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.400]   You know, dude's a, he's strong, he's physical,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.720]   and a lot of times, I try to use my weight,
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.520]   or my size, to get guys.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.440]   And I had to learn with Ron, I was like,
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.000]   man, I gotta try to out-quick him,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.880]   'cause he's too strong to be tryin'
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.320]   to go up against all day long.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.000]   I'd be tired, and then he had really quick hands.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.840]   Like, Ron had really, really quick hands,
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.320]   so I had to protect the ball,
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.720]   try to attack his feet a little more.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.920]   So, all that stuff is just me bein' a fan of it,
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.560]   and just tryin' to, just really win the dang game.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.400]   You know, it's like, you know, you work so hard,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.480]   you're like, man, I wanna get over the hump,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.120]   get over the hump, and in order to get over the hump,
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.800]   you gotta be somebody pretty good,
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.960]   or go after somebody pretty good.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.880]   - You ain't lyin'.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.160]   Shoot, like you said, you kept adding and adding,
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.000]   and kept getting better year after year,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.040]   and that's, like, you took that compliment
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.080]   as a testament to your hard work.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.760]   I wanted to ask you, like, I remember you,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.120]   you talked to me about this one time,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.960]   but your game day routine, like,
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.520]   so, like, we gonna talk about the lifestyle stuff
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.880]   off the court, what you like to do,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.520]   but on the court, what was your, like, motto?
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.720]   Did you, like, was it the same thing every day,
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.680]   and kinda, like, walk me through
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.000]   what a game day would be like for you?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.560]   - Yeah, so, college is different, you know,
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.880]   'cause college is always a little more team-oriented,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.560]   but professionally, my game day usually always went with,
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.120]   like, I would wake up, but I wouldn't eat
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.040]   before I left the house, I would go to shoot-around first,
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   and then I usually try to eat right after shoot-around.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.400]   So, wake up, shoot-around, depending on what's ache,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.360]   you know, aches and pains, it would depend
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.320]   on how early I would go before.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.840]   And also, depending on how deep into the season,
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.120]   if I wanted to lift, I would always try to lift,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.800]   usually a little closer to game time,
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.720]   'cause I wanted to feel a little stronger going into it.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.880]   So, my mornings was really chill,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.880]   and I would almost even tell my body, like,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.560]   I'm gonna be relaxed until about four o'clock,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.360]   'til kinda getting up and getting my shower in.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.360]   So, we'll do shoot-around, then I would eat,
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.400]   then when I go home, you know, I have my son,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.240]   I think my, end of my rookie year,
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.120]   so I would always try to play with him
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.600]   on home games in between.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.720]   And then it's like, all right, now I'm gonna take my nap.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.360]   I might have played one or two basketball games ever
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.080]   from high school on without taking my nap.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.920]   - For real?
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.240]   - And it throws me off in the worst way.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.440]   It's like, if I don't get my nap and my shower,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.200]   I just do not feel like the same person.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.440]   I feel like I'm exhausted.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.840]   It's like, damn, I feel so tired out here.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.960]   And it's like, man.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.680]   So, I would always do my nap, I get a pre-game nap.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.280]   Then for my pre-game nap, I wake up,
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.960]   and then I put on whatever music I got.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.480]   If I'm on the road, I put my thing on the little speaker,
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.320]   play music.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.920]   If I'm at home, I got my music ready, blast it, shower,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   start getting into my groove, getting my body going.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.880]   And then early in my career, I would drive to the games.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.080]   Later, I didn't wanna drive.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.040]   I was just like, nah, I wanna just sit in the car and ride
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.800]   'cause traffic picked up in Portland a lot.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.400]   So, I was like, man, I'm gonna be in the car for an hour.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.520]   Nah, I'm bumping cuts, changing songs.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.320]   Last minute tickets here or there,
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.120]   talking to mom and dad last few minutes.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.640]   And then I get to the arena, I would try to go in
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.360]   and get shots early before the court fill up.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.760]   You know, you got the times where certain dudes come in.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.120]   And shit, I'd go out to the court.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.040]   And we talked about it.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.720]   I just tell you the biggest thing is listening to your body.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.800]   If I felt really tired, I would just tell whichever coach
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.720]   I was working out with that year or that time,
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.080]   like, I'm a little tired, but I wanna work on this.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.120]   I feel like last night, I didn't feel good
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.000]   shooting my pull-up.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.600]   Or, you know, this team loads up a lot.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.360]   So, I know they're gonna double the markets.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.600]   I might get some open threes.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.840]   So, you know, let's get some touch on that.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.200]   And then I try to work on a sweat.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.800]   You know, I'll go good for about,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.360]   I might be out there for 30 minutes,
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.600]   but 15, 10 to 15 minutes, I'm like,
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.400]   okay, I'm gonna work up a lot just to get a feel.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.160]   I wanna get a feel for the arena, the ball,
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.440]   you know, all that stuff.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.280]   You know, I don't know about you,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.520]   but all that stuff seems to matter to me.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.760]   It's like, damn, what ball we playing with tonight?
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.040]   Like, 'cause some of 'em are bad
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.280]   and then some of 'em are, like, damn, that feels plush.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.280]   So, for me, it was like, all right,
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.080]   once I got that feeling,
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.240]   I was going back to the locker room
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.280]   and shit, I was kicking my feet up.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.120]   - For real?
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.520]   - Yep, I kicked my feet up going to training room,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.160]   messing around with Jay Jensen,
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.000]   all the guys in there, rank joke.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.440]   I play better the looser I am.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.280]   - Yeah, and I'm the same way.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.320]   - Yeah, you know, I kinda like to take my mind off of it.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.040]   Me and Nate had had that conversation.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.800]   You know, he was like,
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.920]   the locker room kinda follows your mood.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.880]   You know, he's like, I'm the type of dude, I'm serious.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.840]   So, when Nate come in, Nate's like real,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.520]   he's the coolest dude, he just looks serious all the time.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.200]   So, he was like, but you, you know,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.120]   I hear you talking and, you know, kinda goofing off.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.000]   Conversation ain't got nothing to do with the game.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.960]   We might watch another game, being on the West Coast.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.840]   We get all the East Coast games to be on.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.600]   And then I'll just kick back and, you know,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.280]   clown around again until I tell my mind,
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.240]   all right, around, you know, 20 minutes before tip,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.400]   Nate'll probably do a speech.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.000]   And then that's when I'll start to tap back into,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.280]   all right, this is what we gotta do.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.320]   So, again, it was always a shower.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.680]   It was always a nap.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.160]   And then, as far as how I worked out,
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.920]   which is depending on how my body felt, you know,
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.440]   if I felt like I had a lot of energy,
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.200]   I would go harder because I play better
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.280]   when I'm a little tired, you know?
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.640]   Yeah, people would always ask like,
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.040]   why you play good in the fourth quarter?
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.080]   I'm like, 'cause finally it seemed like
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.240]   my body settled down.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.440]   Or like towards the end of the second quarter, you know,
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.480]   we had games where I didn't even wanna shoot early
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.080]   'cause I felt a little too jacked up.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.360]   So, I swing it, you know,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.080]   try to come out and get some stops, play defense.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.760]   Coach Monte was the one to tell me
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.360]   I had went through a struggle early my rookie year
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.720]   and I was already playing well.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.000]   And then I just went on like a dive.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.240]   I just couldn't seem to mentally figure it out.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.080]   So, we first started at the free throw line.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.960]   He was like, you know, you never look at the free throw.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.160]   He said, you always dribble, dribble,
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.640]   but you never look at the rim.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.960]   He said, start looking at the rim more.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.800]   I was like, all right.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.320]   So, I started picking his brain more and more
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.280]   about other little stuff, you know, inside of the game.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.080]   And he's the one that really helped me, you know,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.560]   kinda evolve, not just being a player,
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.880]   but mentally thinking like, hey, go ahead.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.520]   It's okay to think about it or visualize it
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.520]   before you actually, you know, go out there and do it.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.800]   So, that was really cool to have him there
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.480]   to give me a lot of those small pointers.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.520]   - That's dope.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.320]   And then off the court, you've always been a real chill dude.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.280]   I mean, you know, I've been around you a lot,
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.680]   be around Dell a lot, telling me stories.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.920]   How was your, some dudes get in the league
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.480]   and they like to wild out, go out all the time, spend money.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.360]   Dell, say, you just be chilling.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.320]   Like, what was your, how did you like to, you know,
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.040]   be off the court during those years?
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.320]   - Yeah, so I would say it's balance.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.120]   Some of it is like, I have my son in my rookie year.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.080]   So, I never really just had that time to say,
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.000]   okay, life about me right now.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.080]   'Cause it's like, once he came, I'm like,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.480]   all right, I gotta focus on that.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.680]   But I also set the bar high for myself with basketball.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.520]   So now I'm going, man, I wanna come back
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.400]   and get that kind of attention and praise more next year.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.440]   You know, being rookie of the year was like great,
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.880]   but now it's like, so that kept me focused.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.080]   It kept me grounded.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.000]   And, you know, like most people,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.080]   I think it's always good to have your fun.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.160]   But for me, it was always, you know,
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.000]   I was gonna put my family first
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.200]   and I was gonna put Portland first.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.400]   It was like, you know, this is gonna take away from me,
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.680]   you know, taking us up this hill.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.920]   Then I ain't gonna do it.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.840]   So I was really focused in that way.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.880]   And for the first time, I would say in my life,
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.160]   I was starting to get some attention.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.040]   You know, I've always got it flown under the radar.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.240]   People go, he's good.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.280]   I like him a lot, but nobody really knew me.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.640]   So it was like cool to kind of start getting that attention
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.320]   and then I didn't wanna let it go.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.640]   So off the court, you know,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.040]   I've always been big on like going to movies,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.800]   doing family stuff.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.600]   I mean, I like my fun time too.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.280]   You know, I just try to be private with it.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.160]   And I think, you know, people can do what they want.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.400]   But for me, I like to be a little more private
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.440]   just because it's not really everybody's business.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.200]   But yeah, I like to have fun too.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.240]   You know, I just do it in a private form.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.080]   But other than that, man, I'm like, I'm chill, dude.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.920]   I think I was watching one of your episodes.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.560]   You said you could just go away for a year
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.320]   and just get off everything.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.640]   And I'm like, man, I can really do that.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.960]   Hard part for it now is you'll see
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.560]   is your kids got stuff going.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.400]   - Yeah.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.920]   - You know, it's like, I'm like,
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.280]   if I go run away and disappear, I'll be happy.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.240]   But it's like, damn, I gotta go back to first day of school.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.920]   Oh damn, my kid got a game, you know?
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.840]   So it really becomes impossible to do it.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.520]   So you gotta learn how to do it in spurts.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.360]   - Yeah.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.200]   - And that's how I learned how to do it.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.320]   It's just always taking my time
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.120]   and, you know, never feeling rushed for it.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.360]   So, and then when it's stuff I gotta do for the kids,
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.560]   you know, I gotta, of course,
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.720]   always just be a father for them.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.120]   But I'm chill, man.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.280]   I could disappear.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.760]   I'm fine with nobody, you know, mentioning me.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.920]   I'm the same way as you, bro.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.400]   - Yeah, not wrong with it.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.000]   - Man, one time we talked about,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.680]   I want to bring this up, Greg Oden.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.400]   Because I seen a video on Instagram
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.600]   and it was just a video of him.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.240]   I don't know if you've seen him walking around
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.680]   and like a lady, an old lady just asked him,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.000]   "Did you used to play basketball?"
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.600]   And it was like, he said, "I used to."
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.480]   And he was just like, you could just see how sad he was.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.320]   - Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.440]   - But me and you have talked about Greg Oden
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.720]   and how good and dominant he actually was.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.960]   Like even in the practices with you,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.880]   he was obviously one of the best players.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.080]   So talk about that dude for a little bit.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   - Yeah, man, Greg, no, I'm glad you even asked me about him.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.400]   Like you said, I always speak about him,
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.920]   but, you know, never with much of an audience.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.480]   So that's cool of you to even think about him.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.440]   But, you know, you were a reason why I did think of him
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.200]   because, you know, when I got to the Blazers,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.120]   Greg came in a year after I did.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.240]   And man, I remember I was the,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.200]   I had just won Rookie of the Year,
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.280]   and I think it was Kevin Pitcher was like,
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.480]   "Man, you want to do the draft lottery?"
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.840]   And I was like, "No."
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.080]   'Cause he knows I don't like to fly and travel,
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.400]   especially, you know, my off season.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.800]   He's like, "Nah, I ain't asking this time.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.200]   "You gotta do it, come on, B.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.280]   "You gotta be our good luck charm."
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.600]   And I'm like, "Man, all right, but I'm gonna fly there,
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.680]   "and I'm gonna fly right back."
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.600]   He's like, "All right, done."
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.160]   So I ended up going out there.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.080]   And we knew who it was.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.240]   It was like, if you're number one or two,
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.800]   you're gonna take Durant or Oden.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.360]   So, but we were gonna be like seven.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.640]   So I was thinking like, "All right, whatever."
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.720]   Man, and I get there,
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.680]   and we ended up getting the number one pick.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.120]   And I was like, "Oh, man, I am the good luck charm."
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.480]   So I joke around, and to this day,
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.840]   I still got the jersey that they gave that day
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.400]   where Blazer was number one pick.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.480]   I don't know if they know that, but I kept that.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.160]   So I was going through some stuff the other day,
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.040]   and I had seen it.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   But, you know, we get the number one pick,
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.640]   and people are asking all these questions.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.480]   But before I went on,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.680]   our media person was like, "Don't tell anybody
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.880]   "who we're picking or if we're leaning."
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.720]   I'm like, "Yes."
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.800]   I give the whole, you know, what you call it,
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.400]   public answer or whatever they call it.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.080]   So I ended up getting back to Portland,
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.680]   and I'm thinking like, "Well, who are we gonna take?"
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.400]   'Cause now everybody's texting, you know?
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.240]   It ain't social media.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.440]   Everybody's like, "Well, who are you guys gonna take,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.600]   "Kevin Durant or Greg Oden?"
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.560]   And, you know, everything that I'm gonna say
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.760]   about Greg Oden is not taking anything away
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.080]   from Kevin Durant.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.040]   Kevin Durant is, you know, again,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.440]   he's on that level of guys where, you know,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.800]   my favorites are, you know,
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.520]   Jordan, Kobe, Kevin Durant.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.200]   He's in that conversation.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.960]   So, but Greg Oden, man, when I seen him,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.480]   and you gotta remember, this is a different NBA now.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.640]   You know, you still post up.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.400]   You know, you still play with the big.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.080]   So, long story short, we end up drafting Greg,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.040]   and we're having like, you know, these workouts.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.440]   And we're doing like football stuff,
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.960]   and we're out in the field.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.000]   Man, we was doing 100 yard down and backs,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.400]   and, you know, Greg and LaMarcus are like,
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.240]   they're winning,
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.000]   and these dudes are the tallest players on the team.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.960]   Like, he could run.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.200]   Like, he could run.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.280]   And then, when we got in the open gym,
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.200]   whoever's team Greg was on was gonna win,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.040]   'cause you know how it is.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.400]   Like, man, we're all good,
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.840]   but it comes down to those, like, you know,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.040]   couple plays here and there,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.960]   and Greg could defend better than just about anybody,
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.800]   and then he can get offensive rebounds.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.160]   He kept every ball alive.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.360]   So, I was like, man.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360]   And I remember calling my dad.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.680]   He was like, you know, how good is he?
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.280]   I was like, oh, we could win a championship.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.920]   Like, for the first time in my life,
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   playing with him, I was like,
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.480]   we could win a championship.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.320]   He was that good.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.160]   And I'm not saying we could win, like, that year,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.880]   but having him on the team,
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.080]   we had everything we needed to win a championship,
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.560]   because he filled a lot of those holes.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.720]   And I was like, man, he was that good.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.040]   I mean, once he got comfortable in games,
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.320]   I was telling Nate, I'm like, I don't know.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.600]   I'm kind of bored, 'cause Greg does so much.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.760]   Even defensively, you know, I'm guarding dudes,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.320]   and, you know, our help defense don't have to really help,
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.160]   'cause he helps everything.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.520]   So, I started, like, learning, like,
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.680]   okay, so I'm gonna leak out.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.120]   I started getting more transition stuff,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.360]   'cause I'm like, Greg's gonna get the board.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.440]   And offensively, he gets tips.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.280]   He just tips.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.120]   It doesn't matter.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.960]   He's pushing dudes, just tipping the ball,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.920]   keeping plays alive.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.480]   We got second chance points.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.240]   And I was like, man, he made the game so damn easy.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.960]   And, I mean, LaMarcus had to figure out
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.280]   how to play with them, because, you know,
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.200]   even when he get post touches, man, they're doubling,
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.440]   so we're more open, and we're not used to being open.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.080]   We're used to, like, having to, you know,
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.600]   carry the load to win games,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.120]   and now we're winning games more comfortably.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.080]   So, no, he was a special player,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.520]   and I mean, I hate when people try to say stuff,
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.080]   you know, a bust, you know.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.040]   He was injured, but if he was never injured,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   there's no way in hell he was a bust.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.200]   I mean, he had a Hall of Fame talent.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.360]   I mean, that kid was, he was good.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.200]   He could shoot free throws with his left hand.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.680]   He shoot 'em with his right.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.480]   He had everything, and I just wish the world
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.200]   would've got a chance to see that.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.440]   You know, he was that good.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.280]   He was that good.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.600]   He was an even better person, man.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.480]   He would've loved to be his teammate.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.520]   Cool as a fan, man.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.400]   Best dude.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.080]   I'm telling you, man, we were in Vegas.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.960]   I went to Summer League, and, like I said,
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   I just wanted rickety.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.880]   I played really well, and, man, we were all down there
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.640]   playing the little dollar slots, clowning around,
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.840]   and, you know, people were coming up to us.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.680]   Man, Greg came down to the lobby.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.760]   Man, it was mayhem.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.920]   People were going, I was like, we got the league.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.360]   Security was like, man, we was gonna take you guys
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.600]   back to your rooms, 'cause people just went that crazy,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.720]   and I was like, damn, he's that big.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.200]   So it was real special to see Greg again.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.000]   You know, Kevin Durant has blossomed to, you know,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.600]   he's one of the best players to ever play the game,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.320]   and then Greg Owen was right there with him.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.600]   You know, they were, you know, again, like I said,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.240]   even then, it was no who's better.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.480]   It was just, you know, they're both gonna be great players.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.680]   It's just a matter of what's gonna,
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.080]   or who you're gonna take, and that's what made it,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.520]   that's what made it like, man, I just hate
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.640]   that the world couldn't see, you know,
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.040]   him at that Kevin Durant level, 'cause they would still,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.760]   they would probably still be rivaling each other,
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.120]   you know what I mean, going at it,
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.880]   'cause he could protect that basket,
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.240]   Kevin Durant could stretch the court,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.080]   so, you know, I thought they had that kind of vibe.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.280]   - Greg, actually, you know, I don't know
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.040]   if you had to do the rookie transitions back in the day.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.880]   - Yeah, heck yeah, we did, man, it changed.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.080]   - So, when I did mine, Greg came down there,
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.320]   and he gave his whole, you know,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.520]   I think it was the first year he did it,
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.760]   he did a whole speech, and that's when I really like,
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   I think I hollered at him after, just,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.800]   man, I connected that, because I got injured,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.200]   I didn't know at the time if I was ever gonna be the same,
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.760]   I wasn't playing at that time, and he was saying,
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.280]   kind of when he was talking to the whole group,
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.560]   like, about what happened after that, like,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.600]   he got hurt, you know, and then eventually,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.400]   he's out the league, and like, the toll that took on him,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.560]   you know, he talked about, man, he just,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.800]   he was in a down place, like,
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.520]   I think he said he went to the woods, you know,
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.440]   was just drinking too much, like, every day, like,
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.800]   - You could tell he was depressed.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   - Yeah, he was, you know, that obviously was a lot,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.400]   and like, even for you, you went through these injuries,
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.400]   people talk about you could've been an all-time great,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.200]   does any of that stuff ever, like, weigh on you
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.720]   the same way, and do you ever think about,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.760]   kind of like, what could've been,
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.640]   or are you completely past all that?
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.240]   - You know, I would say compared to you and Greg,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.360]   the way I look at it, it was,
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.920]   I was able to get the early years, so, you know,
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.400]   when it did come to that decision of saying, like,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.640]   this is just getting too painful
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.200]   to keep trying to rehab and play through,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.760]   I was older than where, you know, Greg was,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.920]   and, you know, the thing I always felt bad for Greg,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.760]   because, you know, again, we didn't have this,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.400]   it wasn't the social media era,
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.400]   but the era we came in was,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.600]   it was tough, because, you know,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.640]   I think the country was in a recession,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.240]   you know, they don't even feel right giving you money,
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.080]   you know, in the league, so it was like,
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.760]   we were under that scrutiny of,
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.280]   but are you really worth it, or, you know,
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.080]   every time the wind blows, you're hurt,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.160]   so we had to deal with a lot of that media presence
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.760]   that can really wear on a person,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.040]   so you can see it with Greg,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.840]   because the media put 'em here,
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.080]   and then the media felt like they had to bring 'em here,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.360]   and that was the disappointing part,
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.840]   our time that we lived in as players,
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.960]   it's like, you know, there was days where,
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   you know, I was really in pain,
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.760]   but I didn't want to hear the radio shows,
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.800]   and people going, oh damn, he's hurt again,
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.640]   so I would try to play, and I would keep trying to play,
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.200]   because I didn't want to, you know,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.560]   I didn't want to deal with the naysayers,
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.480]   and then you gotta deal with the side of contractual-wise,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.400]   they're like, you gotta pull teeth to get contracts,
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.960]   you know, so, you know, and I had heard Trae Young say that,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.760]   and he was right in a lot of ways
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.080]   that we didn't have the social media, you know,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.480]   towards the end, when I was in, I think Portland, 2010,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.000]   you know, I was in a playoff game,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   and I think I played like five, six minutes,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.120]   and, you know, I think it was Patty Mills,
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.680]   and they were looking through like their Twitters,
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.320]   and I was just like, what they say about me?
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.720]   Fans was just going in on me,
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.040]   I was like, damn, how y'all do that?
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.440]   Like, how do you guys read it?
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.080]   - I can't, to this day, I don't do it.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.080]   - I would be ticked, and I'm thinking in my head,
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.040]   like, man, I only played six minutes,
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.320]   how will I upload a damn gig?
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.600]   But, you know, so, but then I kind of caught myself
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.400]   in understanding where young kids now, you know,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.840]   you guys always got that, that everybody has access
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.040]   to tell you what you look like, so, for me, you know,
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.840]   I always just tried to, you know, block it out,
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.520]   but I definitely understand, you know,
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.800]   where he's coming from, but, you know, it's also,
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.760]   in our era, it's like, you know,
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.040]   I was a three-time All-Star before my second contract,
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.480]   and, you know, my negotiations was hard as hell,
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.240]   because, you know, you got owners losing money,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.320]   you got everybody, and, where now, you know,
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.000]   I see dudes making, you know, double the money,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.880]   and never really, you know, they're just still getting seen
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.080]   as the potential, and every era are gonna argue about
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.680]   which is harder, which is tougher,
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.640]   I just try to get advice to, you know, master your time,
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.760]   don't worry about what our era was talking about,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.360]   you know, 'cause I'm sure I didn't go through
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.040]   as much as what guys did in the '90s,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.240]   I just have a lot of appreciation for what they went through,
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.080]   so we was able to get more, you know,
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.680]   and then the next generation gets more,
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.960]   so that's how I just always pay it forward,
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.840]   because there'll be something the next generation
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.760]   will go through that you guys don't,
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.000]   try to explain to them what they're not seeing,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.800]   so it's not never about looking backwards,
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.560]   it's always looking forward, but that was just kind of a,
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.000]   you know, what Greg had to go through in our generation,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.720]   you know, it's like, then you can see the pressure
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.840]   from the general managers and coaches,
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.200]   it's like, well, you know, we gotta stick with 'em,
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.920]   you know, we gotta stick with 'em,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.200]   and Greg felt that, you know, insecurity of maybe
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.360]   if they wanted to, or did they have to,
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.200]   'cause we took 'em one, and then you got Kevin Rant,
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.400]   becoming one of the best players in the world,
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.840]   so he always had to deal with that,
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.400]   so I always felt bad for him, because he was a good dude,
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.320]   if he was a jerk, I think you wouldn't care,
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.400]   but he was a really good dude,
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.200]   so I was, you know, again, I was happy you asked that,
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.560]   you know, he was gonna be, he was on his way
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.000]   to being an All-NBA player.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.760]   - That's dope.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.280]   So more as advice for, like, younger dudes,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.760]   but going through everything you went through,
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.720]   what would you have done different,
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.240]   as far as, like, listening to your body
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.200]   before all the injuries, like, what,
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.160]   if you could go back, like, what would you do different
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.000]   than you did?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.560]   - Yeah, I mean, of course I would listen to my body,
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.920]   you know, I try to tell people, you know,
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.040]   because of our, you know, what do they call it, air,
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.840]   we had to, we had to play through some stuff,
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.880]   you know, it was like, we couldn't just say,
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.840]   look, I'm just gonna take this time and get my body right,
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.760]   you know, you wasn't gonna get the money you wanted,
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.760]   neither, so, you know, in order to change, like,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.200]   that part of it, we would have to change a lot of things,
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.800]   but I would say that the one thing
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.760]   that I would have changed was how I prepared.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.680]   I always, like, wanted to go and prepare
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.520]   as far as play basketball,
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.320]   and I would have put more time into, you know,
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.080]   what I think, you know, a lot of younger guys
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.000]   do really well, you know, like yourself,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.280]   is you guys put a lot of time into your bodies,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.520]   as in, you know, sometimes you go to the gym
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.920]   and you don't hoop yet, you just do a lot of stretching,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.520]   lifting, just, I would have really focused
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.120]   on that area of it, where I was a dude to,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.400]   you know, I'll go in the gym and I'll do my lift,
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.680]   but then there's, like, I wanna get on the court
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.040]   and start doing some court stuff,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.400]   where I would have changed that part,
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.760]   I would have probably put a lot more into, you know,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.120]   I had a chef, but then it was like,
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.040]   man, I don't really know if I really needed a chef,
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.000]   I would have been more committed to that part of it.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.120]   - Yeah, but there wasn't as much research
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.320]   and as much, like--
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.400]   - And they were trying, they were trying, though, Mike,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   I mean, I will say, like, we put a lot of, you know,
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.160]   especially with being hurt and then Greg being hurt,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.200]   you know, we brought in a lot of people
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.720]   to really try to focus on those things,
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.400]   it's just we weren't, we weren't used to it,
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.840]   we weren't used to putting that much effort into something,
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.320]   you know, we weren't, you know,
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.000]   the research and the effort that they brought to us,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.720]   we weren't into it, it was like,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.320]   that's just not what we do, you know,
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.560]   and I think it's, you know,
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.360]   if you go back to the era before us,
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.160]   it's like, man, all that rehab and stuff,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.160]   it's just, let's hoop, you know,
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.760]   so that's where I would have really focused on,
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.240]   I think young guys already do it, you know,
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.360]   focus on your bodies, you know,
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.960]   look for your body to be able to play until it's 40,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.640]   you know, and whatever it takes, be into it,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.080]   like be into, you know, nutrition,
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.200]   be into, you know, you should be able to teach
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.480]   strength and conditioning, you know,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.000]   by the time you're 30 years old,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.800]   because you're just, you got to really adapt
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.040]   and to get into it, to where as players, you know,
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.040]   I tried to really adapt to, you know,
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.640]   how their coach gonna think, you know,
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.200]   what's their scout gonna say about me,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.840]   and I should have did more of that
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.920]   in the, into taking care of my body,
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.240]   I should have really just been like,
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.040]   man, I know my body really well,
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.040]   I'm eating better, you know, more consistently,
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.400]   just really buying into the, into the taking care of,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.960]   you know, what's gonna, you know, provide for me,
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.160]   so I wish I would have did that better,
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.640]   you know, and not do it better,
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.120]   I wish I would have been more into it,
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.600]   and I think that would have gave me, you know,
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.400]   more years in coming into the league, being into that.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.240]   - Right, right, right.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.600]   - My summers was like, all right, cool,
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.440]   we're gonna hoop, we're gonna work out,
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.480]   I didn't really lift a lot during the summers,
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.040]   and then, you know, I started to do it
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.520]   once I had more injuries, I started to try to catch up,
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.960]   but by then, sometimes it just feels like it's too late,
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.840]   so I wish I'd have came in a little bit more
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.120]   ahead of the curve in taking care of my body.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.000]   - That makes sense, yeah, I definitely think
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.520]   it's more of an emphasis now,
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.520]   a lot of it is 'cause of the guys' careers got cut short.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.360]   - Yeah.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.000]   - But man, off the court, like, off of the NBA stuff,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.640]   you, I mean, the last few years,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.200]   you obviously coached me for that year, Nathan Hale,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.120]   you've coached Garfield a couple times,
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.720]   you've coached three years, three state championships,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.760]   but like, now, what does life look like for you,
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.720]   and what are you really up to these days?
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.200]   - Yeah, well, you know, I'll first say, you know,
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.440]   thanks to you, basketball coaches have been good,
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:50.080]   you know, I think it's no secret, you know,
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.800]   that team that we had, you know, helped, you know,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.520]   my coaching, so, you know, when I first was like,
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.120]   okay, do I wanna coach?
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.920]   You know, I kinda avoided it for years,
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.680]   I wanted to be around basketball,
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.560]   so, I'm like, man, I think I wanna coach.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.000]   I finally just said, all right, Brandon,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.480]   you're gonna have to get out of your comfort zone,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.840]   and you can't be a player forever,
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.680]   but there's nothing wrong with being a coach.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.440]   So I had talked to Coach Romar,
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.640]   I picked his brain about a lot of stuff,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.140]   and the one thing I wanted to know was,
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.640]   does it feel as good being a coach
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.720]   as it does a player in good games?
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.360]   And he understood what I was trying to ask,
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.960]   he's like, man, when I play and I go home
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.480]   after I played and we did good, it's like, yeah.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.560]   I'm like, do you feel good like that as a coach?
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.320]   'Cause you didn't play. - What'd he say?
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   - He said, no, it's not like that, but it's close.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.200]   And he said, do you understand that?
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.400]   I was like, yeah, he said, it's close.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:49.280]   So, coaching you was cool because, you know,
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.720]   when you play in the NBA, you're around talented players,
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.200]   so it's like, man, I gotta go to high school,
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.520]   I gotta kinda, you know, I don't wanna say dumb you down,
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.920]   but the players aren't as good.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.240]   But when I seen you, I'm like,
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.800]   ah, this is like coaching a pro.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.920]   So, I was happy about that,
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.600]   but I was also happy at the same time
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.760]   because I felt like I was back
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.640]   being around basketball again.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   So, to coach, you know, you guys that year,
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.320]   it was cool because it's like,
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.280]   I didn't have the experience, but I had the player.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.280]   So, it helped me where I wasn't as prepared,
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.680]   you were over-prepared being good.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.600]   So, that was like, you know, that was a blessing for me.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.400]   And, you know, even Coach Romer said,
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.640]   you gotta enjoy it now
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.920]   because everybody ain't gonna be as good as Mike
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.160]   year after year.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.520]   You know, you gotta have to, you know,
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.000]   lower your expectations.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.360]   And not to say that the kids, you know,
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.440]   there's only one number one player in the nation every year,
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.680]   you know, so everybody ain't gonna get that.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.480]   And for me to have it my first year, you know,
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.400]   I still found the joy in coaching kids
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.960]   that weren't the number one player,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.720]   but it's just the difference that goes with it.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.040]   So, coaching has been, it's been fun.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   It's been fulfilling.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.000]   You know, the one thing I will say is,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.640]   and Coach Romer came to the game when we were in Portland
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.200]   and we beat Sierra Cane for the championship.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.360]   And I remember dapping him up after the game on the court,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.120]   and I was like, I feel like I played today.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.960]   You know?
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.480]   - We was hype.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.400]   - I was like, I gotta be real with you,
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.640]   it felt like I played.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.640]   Like, so then I got the understanding of, you know,
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.840]   me and him have moments, coach player moment,
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.000]   and I was like, coach is juice, you know?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.360]   I seen that, I felt it.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.400]   I was like, damn, I really went back.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.680]   It was like laying in bed, like thinking about the game,
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.520]   like I played.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.520]   - We was so lit.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.440]   - So that was the moment that I knew like,
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.880]   okay, coaching is fun.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.080]   It gives you that competitiveness.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.400]   You know, you preparing before the game,
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.360]   can't sleep, thinking about this, thinking about that.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.960]   So it gave me all that competitiveness I needed back.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.520]   And I also felt like, you know, the wins were like,
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.360]   I felt good.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.440]   Like, that was crazy, we won that way.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.400]   - I know.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.200]   - Even when we were in, where was it?
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.640]   We played Oak Hill in, yeah.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.680]   And I think we were--
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.640]   - We was in Boston?
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.440]   - That was Boston, yeah.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.000]   And after the game, I think I told you guys,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.320]   I was just like, man, we're gonna be the number one team
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.040]   in the nation on Monday.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.960]   You know, USA Today, like that's--
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.080]   - Like bro, when they talk about arguably
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.280]   the best teams ever, they put Nathan Hale in there.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.560]   - That's crazy to me, but we were a part of it.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.600]   You know, and I think that's the part that, you know,
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.720]   you gotta always take with you.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.400]   And I told PJ this, it's like,
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.520]   man, don't let people erase, you know, your history.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.000]   You know, it's always good to be proud
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.040]   and think about stuff you did that was cool.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.440]   And there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.680]   So, but I remember being in the locker room
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.520]   after we won that one.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.080]   I was like, damn, we really doing it.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.800]   And that's something I dreamed of as a player,
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.960]   but never accomplished it.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.440]   But now as a coach, it's like,
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.320]   it feels like I'm right there with you guys.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   And I felt like a player.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.680]   So, you know, anybody that,
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.120]   and I try to tell guys that can't play no more injuries,
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.520]   it's like, man, coaching is not a bad way to go.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.280]   Like, you know, you get to get into it.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.520]   It's fun.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.080]   And it's another way to be able to be a part of the hoop,
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.920]   which we love, but it's just in a different way.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.760]   You know, it's just more strategy.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.840]   - Man, I tell people all the time,
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.360]   I told this to my AU team,
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.360]   and I tell this to like the young dudes
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.160]   or the coaches that were gonna coach my AU team.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.520]   Like, I tell them about how you coached me.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.800]   Like, it wasn't, man, there was no pressure.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.160]   You said, man, go out there, be you.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.000]   It was ultimate.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.240]   The way your coaching was was ultimate confidence.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.920]   It wasn't like, you know,
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.800]   some coaches got all these little things you gotta follow,
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.720]   which isn't a bad thing,
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.360]   but your approach was confidence.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.960]   And that's why we were number one team in the country,
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.360]   'cause we just went out there and hooped.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.320]   And obviously we had to get along off the court.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.160]   But man, the way you coached me,
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.720]   like the jump I took from my junior year to my senior year
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.960]   was the biggest jump I took.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.440]   And it was a large part to you.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.160]   I mean, we'd be in the gym,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.400]   I'm working on my footwork with you.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.280]   Obviously that helped.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.480]   But like the way that you coached me,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.840]   it took my game to the next level.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.320]   - But you know, that's what I thought.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.200]   It just worked.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.520]   I don't know how we, you know, we meet at that point,
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:11.040]   but I always looked at it like, man, he's really good.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.280]   You know, so I never wanted to make it confusing.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.320]   It was like, whatever you wake up in the morning
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.880]   and figure out, you can do it.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.120]   So I never wanted to step on your toes in that way.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.120]   So I said, well, what's the best way I can help Mike?
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.400]   First was make sure you're confident.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.800]   If you're confident, then the team's gonna do fine.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.640]   And then the next thing was just not,
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.360]   guys around you be complacent to go, oh, we're just gonna,
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.400]   you know, so I'm like, oh God, I gotta kick this guy's butt.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.640]   Or I gotta kick this guy's butt.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.120]   Or in practice it's more like, you know,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.680]   Mike, you know, let's split it up.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   But these guys need a little more work
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.760]   because, you know, in harder games,
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.880]   you're gonna need 'em more than, you know,
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.240]   maybe, you know, 90% of the games.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.480]   You know, you could probably, you can't win by yourself,
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.880]   but to win championships,
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.920]   you're gonna need, you know, these guys around.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.600]   So no, I just wanted to give you confidence.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.000]   I always told, you know, like I always talk to my parents,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   no matter what I do, it's like,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.120]   mom and dad are always gonna be, you know, rocks
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.240]   because that's who I sat with as kids and bounce stuff off.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.280]   And my mom had told me, she said,
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.440]   you don't have a big ego, so you'll be okay as a coach
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.160]   because you won. - Exactly, that's what it was.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.640]   - But she's, that's what she, and I was,
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.720]   when I talk to you and other people,
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.400]   or other players, it's just the same thing.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.280]   It's like, I don't feel like I gotta put my stamp on it.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.600]   It's like, nah, if we win, that is the stamp.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.280]   So with you, it was more like,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.400]   I don't need to prove to nobody that we're winning.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.720]   So I don't, but I didn't feel like I had a personal thing
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.320]   to prove to anyone.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.880]   I'm like, but let me show I can draw this up,
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.960]   or let me show you that my scheme is working,
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.800]   or let me, because I never looked at it,
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.680]   was it about me, it was about the team.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.120]   So, and each year is different.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.840]   Like, I can't play, you know, this upcoming season
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.800]   like I did when we had you.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.720]   I gotta go cater to their strengths.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.040]   So my biggest thing was just to try to cater
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.560]   to your strengths, and then I think the rest filled in.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.800]   You and Tay being brothers helped
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.560]   because him being a second best player,
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.320]   you guys already had your chemistry.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.200]   So he was like, yeah, Mike's the guy,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.160]   and I'm right there with him.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.000]   I'm riding with him.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.600]   So I didn't have to worry about my two best players
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.720]   having a problem, because my two best players
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.360]   were brothers that you guys just had,
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.160]   you know, you guys had chemistry, great chemistry.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.440]   So, like I said, my job was easy the first year.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.480]   It was really, it was sweet, you know?
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.400]   You got me started on my coaching.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.800]   I'm like, people ask me about coaching.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.480]   I'm like, you guys gotta thank Mike, man.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.440]   Mike got me coaching.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.840]   He got me in the game, you know?
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.480]   So no, I appreciate that.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.920]   I mean, you were the, you know, hardest working dude.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.400]   I tell the kids that I coached after you.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.320]   I said, I had a player who's the number one player
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.400]   in the country.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.080]   He worked harder than everybody on the team.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.960]   So if I got a guy who's not working that hard,
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.240]   then, you know, he might wanna start
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.360]   playing basketball now, because if the number one player
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.680]   works the hardest, how hard you think you gotta work,
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.920]   and you top 100?
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.040]   So those messages and the little things
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.560]   helped me with these guys now.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.360]   - It was a fun year, and I appreciate you, man.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.760]   We wrapping it up, but I got one more personal question,
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.200]   then I got just a fun question.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.040]   - All right.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.440]   - Man, so we talking about your life,
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.520]   like the last few years.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.680]   Man, I remember getting the news a couple years ago,
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.120]   you and my guy, Deli, y'all got popped.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.560]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.760]   - Y'all got, my mom, I think my mom told me,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.960]   she's like, Mike, on Twitter, it said B-Roy got,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.240]   B-Roy and Del got shot, like,
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.160]   but I don't know any more news in my heart.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.840]   Like, I remember, like, bro, it felt like one of my brothers
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.840]   had died or something, like, I didn't know if you,
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.040]   I didn't know what happened.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.080]   - Yeah.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.560]   - Man, walk us through that story,
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:48.080]   and, like, how you got shot, bro.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.760]   - Yeah, so, you know, I'll be honest,
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.760]   I never really spoke about it.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.200]   I don't wanna say I've avoided it, but,
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:00.320]   this the thing with getting shot, especially from,
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   you know, the, I don't wanna say culture,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.640]   I don't even know the right word to use,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.600]   especially from where, you know, I know I came from.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:11.160]   You know, sometimes getting shot can get,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.200]   it can kind of create its own story, you know,
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.560]   and, you know, from when I was growing up,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.760]   it was like, if a dude get shot and survive, you know,
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.680]   it made him almost cool, you know,
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.960]   and I never wanted to, I never wanted the message
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.840]   to be put out there a certain way.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.160]   - You ain't never talked about it.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.240]   That's why I didn't know if you was gonna answer.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.480]   - Yeah, no, again, and it's for the reasons of,
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.400]   I never want kids to, 'cause there's too much,
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.080]   you know, violence, you know, especially with,
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.240]   you know, people getting shot and those things,
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.200]   and, you know, I don't never, I don't wanna detail it,
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.840]   but the part that was really sad was that,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.640]   you know, there was just so many kids out there,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.640]   and to see, to see that kind of,
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:01.760]   you know, shooting and things going on
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.120]   with no regard for families and kids,
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.880]   and, you know, not even knowing who I was,
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.880]   was like, I felt bad for the people in that community.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.000]   You know, like, damn, you guys have to live
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.400]   under that kind of threat.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.240]   - Yeah.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.920]   - And again, it was, I was just,
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.400]   I had a lot of mixed emotions, you know.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.280]   We always talk about what we're scared of,
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.360]   but until you're pushed to that envelope,
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.640]   is when you find out, and it's not just getting shot.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.800]   It could be a car accident, plane, whatever it is,
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.680]   and I remember, like, you know, when I was running,
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   and I finally, you know, ran around a corner,
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.080]   and I sat down, and I was like,
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.440]   whoa, I got a hole in my sweats, like, what the?
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:54.240]   So, the thing that scared me in, you know,
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.720]   even to this day, every once in a while,
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.160]   I have a bad nightmare about 'em,
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.520]   is I thought about my kids,
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   and I thought about a world that is, you know, it's chaotic,
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.480]   but them having to grow up in it without me
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.880]   being there to be that buffer,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.400]   and I was just so worried, and I remember, you know,
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.000]   I finally, you know, they cut my pants off and stuff,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.160]   and I'm in an ambulance, and I'm like,
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.120]   I wanna call my kids, and I wanted to call 'em
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.960]   for the same reason where, you know,
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.240]   you hear the news that somebody gets shot,
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.720]   you think the worst, and I was like,
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.760]   I wanna tell them before they hear from anybody else.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.000]   So, I got to get on the phone with 'em,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.960]   and I was like, hey, I got shot.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.840]   I said, I'm not hurt, I'm okay,
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.600]   but I don't want you guys to get that feeling of,
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.640]   you know, somebody calling my kids or, you know,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.280]   their mom saying, he got shot,
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.800]   and we don't know what's going on.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.440]   So, I never want them to feel that, like,
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.960]   oh, crap, is dad not gonna be around?
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   But again, the fear of being not in their lives,
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.480]   because there's just so much crap.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.920]   It ain't, it's not just, you know, shootings.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.600]   There's a lot of stuff that goes on,
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.200]   a lot of manipulation that goes on in this world,
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.080]   and I just would hate to not be there for 'em.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.840]   But, yeah, nah, I never really detailed it.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.320]   I never wanted to seem like I was coming across as,
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.400]   like, you know, it's nothing to ever glorify,
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.640]   because, you know, it could be over that fast,
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.880]   and it reminds you of that.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.280]   So, nah, you know, it's hard to go, I guess,
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.760]   into details of it, but I really felt bad
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.560]   for the people that was there.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.880]   You know, that, you know, I had a couple,
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.320]   you know, little cousins and things,
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.560]   and, you know, I talked to 'em a little bit after,
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.360]   but, you know, they gotta go, so they started school,
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.560]   and it's just like, man, it wasn't that big of a deal,
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.840]   I guess, that that happened.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.680]   - Down there, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.320]   - You know, and that's where I felt really bad,
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.360]   and I felt really, really, you know, good that,
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.520]   you know, my kids aren't in the same environment.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.200]   You just want to be able to, you know,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.880]   hopefully be able to help more people
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.880]   that are in those dangerous situations.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.920]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.120]   For you, did it, do you feel like it changed
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.200]   any of your values, or anything that you, like,
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.680]   look to in this life to fill you,
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:10.000]   or perspective-wise, anything like that?
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.320]   - You know, I'm pretty solid with, like, my beliefs.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.360]   You know, I don't, I'm not easily swayed.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.920]   You know, even though it was an unfortunate incident,
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.600]   I don't, I don't have, like, any ill will.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:27.440]   You know, I have forgiveness, you know.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.920]   For me, it's like, you know, they couldn't have,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.480]   whoever did it, couldn't have possibly known,
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.440]   'cause I didn't have any problems with anybody.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.840]   So, it's just like, you know, I'd rather forgive,
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.920]   and hope that a person can see that I forgive them
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.720]   for something they, for almost taking my life,
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.200]   and hopefully they can be better people going forward.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.560]   Like, you know, hopefully it's,
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.280]   it ain't about a person getting caught,
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.760]   it's just hopefully a person changing, really,
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.440]   and never, and never doing that again.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.760]   And hopefully talking somebody else out of doing that.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.400]   And if that's the, if that's the, if that's the message,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.960]   then that, that's what makes me happy,
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.560]   'cause it's like, it always hurts worse
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.920]   when you know the person, but if you don't know anybody,
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.640]   you know you didn't have any problem with them,
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.800]   then it's like, you know, you almost took somebody's life,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.520]   so don't do it again, 'cause that's the,
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.680]   that ain't how you wanna live.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.400]   So, no, I don't, I don't know.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   I mean, my perspective is just, you know, again,
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.200]   I just hope that we can stop getting these kids
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.920]   to, you know, stop shooting each other, you know what I mean?
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   - But giving them something else to do, you know,
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.120]   and something else productive where they feel,
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.440]   feel a part of things.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.440]   - Yeah.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.760]   Stop, man, last question.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.400]   Obviously, man, you 37, you can't say.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.760]   - Don't tell my kids at 36.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.200]   - You a young boy.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.360]   You got, like, a lot of life left.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.200]   And I know, for me, I think about after basketball,
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.360]   like, what do I, what am I gonna view as my purpose?
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.120]   Like, what am I gonna even wanna do?
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.480]   - For you, kinda like, what's your,
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.320]   what's your goals moving forward and what's your,
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.600]   what do you feel like your purpose is moving forward?
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.880]   - Yeah, I would say my goals now,
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.080]   my son's gonna go to high school,
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.000]   so it's, number one is my kids.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.520]   Like, just seeing their progression.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.120]   You know, now I'm, you know,
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.080]   seeing him into that high school realm.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.720]   I really wanna get in the gym,
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.800]   what even, work, what even, and hopefully,
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.320]   I guess, sum it up, push them to reach their goals.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.840]   You know, my parents did a lot of sacrifices
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.240]   so, you know, I could reach mine,
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.320]   and I wanna be able to do the same for them.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.480]   As far as, you know, just, you know,
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.920]   my parents are great, and I wanna be great to my kids.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.920]   I still wanna, you know, I wanna coach.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.320]   I love being a part of coaching.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.120]   I'm not sure, you know, I think I wanna get more involved
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.720]   in, you know, maybe team building.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.680]   I've always been, you know, really big on personnel fits.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.560]   I'm not sure where that lies.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.720]   You know, I do like coaching,
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.920]   but I don't know if I'm more of a, you know,
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.440]   helping, you know, evaluate talent, you know,
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.200]   helping evaluate, you know, personnel,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.920]   you know, what guys fit, chemistry,
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.800]   you know, all that type of stuff.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.200]   But, you know, other than that, man,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.760]   my faith is always, you know, it's always in Christ.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.960]   So, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.120]   that's where it's always gonna lie.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.120]   You know, if I'm good there, I feel like I'm good anywhere.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.960]   So, you know, I know it sounds, you know,
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.840]   a lot of people think it just sounds cliche,
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.680]   but if you feel like you're right there,
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.160]   then, you know, all that stuff in the world
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.160]   will take care of itself.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.240]   - You ain't lying.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.080]   That was dope.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.880]   Well, man, listen, I appreciate you being on here.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.760]   I feel like you shared a lot of wisdom,
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.040]   a lot about you and where you at.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.800]   I know a lot of people be wondering where you are,
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.640]   'cause you don't really do know anything.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.440]   - I'm gonna come out a little bit.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.560]   - You don't never come outside,
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.840]   but appreciate you, my guy.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.680]   - No doubt, man.

[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.360]   - You already know.
