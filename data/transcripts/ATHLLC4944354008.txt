[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.760]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.280]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.960]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.640]   to introduce today's guest, David Chang.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.760]   He's a culinary icon known for founding
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.880]   the renowned restaurant group Momofuku,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.320]   but wow, has he done so much more.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.560]   He's received six James Beard Awards,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.960]   has three New York Times bestsellers,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.760]   hosts two podcasts, and has four original TV series,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.440]   including "Secret Chef" on Hulu, which comes out this week.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.920]   With a resume like that, we could take this conversation
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.560]   in so many directions,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.360]   but today I wanna focus on cooking at home,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.840]   which is not only something Dave is super passionate about,
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.160]   but also it's the title of a book he released
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.320]   during the pandemic.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.080]   And if you didn't know, Dave is on a mission
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.400]   to empower people to become masters of their own kitchens.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.060]   We're gonna cover a range of topics,
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.600]   like his favorite easy home cooking techniques,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.940]   some underrated ingredients, a lot of home cooking hacks,
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.320]   the biggest of which might be using your microwave more,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.960]   a device he's called the single best piece of equipment
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.480]   in a kitchen, and so much more.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.800]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.680]   Dave, thanks for being here.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   - Excited to be here.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.560]   - You've really spent a lot of time talking about recently
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.520]   in the past few years, cooking at home.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.680]   Why do you think home cooking
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.240]   and restaurant cooking is so different?
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.840]   And what are people getting wrong
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.360]   when they maybe try to emulate
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.200]   all these recipes they find online?
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.400]   - Restaurant cooking is something entirely different
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.280]   than home cooking.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.660]   50% of many of the things that home cooks use and do
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.660]   are distilled from fine dining concepts.
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.620]   And the rest, they're just like whatever works best.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.020]   But I would say most of the times,
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.300]   however you cook in a high-end professional kitchen
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.660]   does not translate whatsoever in a home kitchen.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.820]   And I jokingly say it's like learning
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.380]   how to drive an F1 race car.
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.540]   It's the same thing as a car, as a Prius,
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.980]   but very, very, very different.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.500]   And as crazy as it sounds,
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.420]   I do think it's somewhat applicable
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.060]   because how I would drive a race car
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.860]   is very different than how I would drive at home.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.620]   And a lot of things are just sort of unnecessary.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.260]   And so much of professional cooking
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.380]   is about volume, exquisite knife cuts,
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.800]   getting specific kinds of ingredients.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.980]   They're just really not at all useful for the home cook.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.940]   And I had never cooked at home before.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.200]   I watched my mom cook, but I never cooked myself.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.900]   In college, I never cooked.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.200]   So my real first job cooking was in a professional kitchen.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.780]   And when you start cooking professionally,
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.020]   if you have friends that cook in restaurants on the line
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.780]   or something like that,
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.300]   you'll probably hear them say they never cook at home
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.900]   because they just are always too tired.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.140]   And the last thing they wanna do
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.540]   is spend all day cooking on their one day off.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.260]   So you fast forward, I don't know, 15, 20 years later,
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.500]   I had never cooked at home.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.580]   And almost in all of my apartments,
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.900]   I had paper plates or those plastic bundles
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.180]   of salt and pepper and soy sauce and chopsticks
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.720]   and plastic forks and knives.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.260]   Those were my utensils.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.340]   And I never had anything.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.660]   I never had a plate or cups
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.700]   until I started dating my now wife.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.180]   She was like aghast at the fact
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.820]   that I didn't have anything to cook with or eat on.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.620]   So literally, I never cooked at home.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.640]   And then when my wife became pregnant with our first child,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.620]   that's when I started to cook in earnest.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.540]   And everything that I did
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.620]   was not how I would ever teach anybody else to cook.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.620]   They were very, very, very,
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.120]   I would almost say inappropriate ways of cooking
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.780]   because it was almost perverse.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.420]   The thing that allows me to do it
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.980]   is I understand food science and I understand technique
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.340]   and I can sort of reverse engineer
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.420]   how to get to the end goal of a dish,
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.540]   which ultimately is delicious.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.940]   So long story cut short,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.060]   I figured out a bunch of hacks that work for me
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.060]   and some of them work for other people as a home cook.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.900]   - I love it 'cause I feel like I had the opposite thing.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.400]   I was cooking at home a lot
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.940]   and then we had kids about three years ago.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.960]   And it's like, where's this time?
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.260]   I don't have time to cook.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.860]   And we went through a few cycles
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.100]   and in preparation for this conversation,
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.460]   I read your "Cooking at Home" book.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.940]   And I was like, okay, I'm ready to get back into it
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.180]   because we went from we have no time
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.180]   and we tried hiring someone to meal prep
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.660]   and deliver food to us.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.800]   We tried a lot of stuff.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.700]   I'm ready to get back into cooking,
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.220]   but in a much more casual, not high stress,
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.600]   way things out like ridiculous way.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.660]   So all these hacks are great and I wanna hear them.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.340]   But you mentioned you have all this background
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.820]   in the science, you understand it all.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.900]   Does everyone need that?
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.420]   Is that a prereq?
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.940]   - I think science is important to at least trust
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.260]   or to have some understanding of,
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.580]   because I think a lot of the taboo things
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.520]   in a home kitchen stem from, oh, you can't cook it that way
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.840]   or you're not allowed to do it a certain way
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.800]   because this is how it's always been done.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.480]   And if you don't like challenging the status quo in life
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.600]   and the kitchen is probably not the easiest thing
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.480]   to sort of do 'cause cooking seems like the provenance
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.580]   of keeping it safe, keeping it simple, keeping it wholesome.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.520]   If you believe in science, then it's a lot easier
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.960]   to do certain things that you may not normally do.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.800]   - Okay.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.460]   Are there some principles that we should just lay out front
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.580]   before we chat about things people just need
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.520]   to kind of either throw out the window, old wisdom
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.300]   or science to understand and lay a foundation?
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.540]   - I mean, there's so much just stupid shit.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.380]   - Let's do it.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.400]   Let's do it.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.820]   - I mean, I don't even know which ones.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.520]   You just have to see it to do it.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.500]   Like I saw, like some people were telling me,
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.060]   oh, you gotta soak your chicken in milk.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.900]   I'm like, why?
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.340]   Oh, 'cause it takes out the blood.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.180]   I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920]   Like, you're not brining it, you're just soaking it for what?
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.440]   And they don't even know, if you ask them why,
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.840]   they're like, it's 'cause my mom did it.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.680]   That's the kind of stuff that happens where you're like,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.200]   okay, like it's not necessary for you to do that.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.160]   It just, it's certain things about time and temperature.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.220]   That's all that matters.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.160]   But I think the one that's the easiest thing
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.600]   that I talk about the most is probably the microwave.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.680]   - Most people think the microwave is like a quick place
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.800]   to reheat leftovers.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.400]   I, in the last week, have talked to a handful of people.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.160]   All of them seemed like it was crazy
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.640]   when I told them we were cooking full meals
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.280]   in the microwave with like meat and fish.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.320]   So what do you want to tell these people
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.080]   that think the microwave is not a way to cook?
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.320]   Because I think you've said it's the single best piece
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.720]   of equipment you have in your kitchen.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.760]   - I mean, it's a joke.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   It's like culinary arbitrage.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.080]   It's like the best play
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   if you were gonna try to make a financial trade here.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.600]   It's in like 91% of all US households collecting dust.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.640]   And if people use it, it's usually for popcorn
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.120]   or for reheating leftovers or a mug of water for something.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.880]   And the reality is, I mean, it's not a joke.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.280]   It's sort of like you press a button and things get hot.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.240]   It's like the most magical element
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.160]   I could possibly think of.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.320]   It's unfortunate that the UX and the UI is so bad
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.120]   on microwaves across the board and the marketing of it,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.560]   because if the microwave technology came out today,
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.000]   I don't think you'd call it a microwave.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.960]   That's what happens when you leave it to the military
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.280]   to come up with sort of marketing.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.520]   It'd probably be called the turbo chef, right?
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.480]   'Cause that's what you use when you go into a Starbucks
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   and they reheat all your food.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.040]   It's a convection oven and a microwave,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.160]   but it's called a turbo chef.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   And that's gonna be coming to a kitchen near you.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.400]   And it's gonna be marketed as the new convection oven
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.840]   that's going to dramatically chop off 75%
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.160]   of your cooking time.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.880]   And it will conveniently drop
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.080]   that it's using microwave technology
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.440]   to cook your food faster.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.480]   People are using microwaves all the time.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.600]   When they go out to eat, they may not realize it.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.960]   But ultimately, if you understand the science,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.200]   you're using microwaves to effectively heat
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.000]   the water molecules inherent in foods.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.800]   And that's all that's happening.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.320]   And it's steaming in and of itself.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.740]   So it's the most energy efficient way of cooking.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.760]   Again, if you cook for two hours,
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.920]   it's probably not right for the microwave, right?
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.120]   But for cooking, like say blanching some broccoli
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.520]   or something like that,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.120]   why would I take four liters of water,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.360]   take 12 minutes to bring that to a boil,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.160]   steam or boil my broccoli
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.120]   when I could do that in five minutes in a microwave?
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.760]   It's just more energy efficient, number one.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.320]   Number two, it's gonna be the most nutrient dense way
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.400]   of preserving all the stuff in your food
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.880]   because there's no osmosis.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.600]   There's nothing happening where you're gonna lose
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.120]   any flavor or any nutrients to the water
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.940]   or to the outside environment.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.380]   Three, you can cook cleaner than anything else.
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.720]   I don't have to add anything to a microwave, right?
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.660]   Like I don't have to add oil, I don't have to add fat.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.580]   So it's theoretically, 'cause you can,
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.700]   make delicious things with no fats whatsoever
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.340]   if you should so choose.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.300]   And if you look at it just as a steamer,
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.840]   basically it's really good for anything
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.300]   that doesn't need to be crispy
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.180]   or long braise for that matter.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.780]   We're trying to break down muscle fibers, et cetera.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.580]   So most people would think that it's crazy
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.420]   to cook a lobster in a microwave, right?
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.500]   They'd say that's insane.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.220]   That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.700]   And trust me, I used to be one of those people
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.900]   and tell like, oh yeah, the science sort of makes sense.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.100]   And not that science doesn't make just a sort of sense,
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.700]   it makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.360]   And I'd argue that you could butter poach a lobster
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.480]   in the microwave within any day better than you could
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.200]   and more consistently than any other way of cooking lobster.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.040]   - That's crazy.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.900]   I haven't made it to that point.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.300]   And for anyone listening that isn't familiar with any day,
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.340]   it's a set of microwave cookware
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.820]   that is not just for the microwave.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.820]   The one thing you didn't put in your points
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.940]   was the thing you're cooking with
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.740]   is also the thing that you can store leftovers with
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.220]   and the thing that you can put on the plate to serve with.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.740]   - And you can put it in an oven.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.760]   This morning I just made package of Korean wheat noodles,
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.020]   fresh noodles.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.620]   I had a package of like one and a half pounds
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.500]   of frozen chicken thighs.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.100]   I had some leftover shiitake mushrooms.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.620]   I had a couple of cloves of garlic.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.740]   We're leaving town on Friday.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.080]   So I just wanna use all the stuff we have in the house.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.620]   And now that I'm at the office a lot more, the studio,
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.740]   I'm cooking all my meals ahead of time.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.180]   So my wife or whoever's at home,
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.740]   they can still have a freshly cooked meal.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.980]   They're just reheating it usually in any day.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.660]   So I took a large deep any day.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.460]   I took out the chicken thighs and I covered it in any day
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.620]   and I microwaved it for about seven and a half minutes.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.720]   I took out a pair of scissors
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.100]   and it's still raw in the center, right?
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.380]   This block of frozen chicken thighs.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.220]   And I just cut it up.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.340]   Again, seems insane.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.020]   Taking scissors, kitchen shears,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.420]   and I'm cutting into little bits.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.220]   The main reason why is as a home cook,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.580]   I don't want to wash more dishes than I need to.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.540]   I'm always worried about cross-contamination with poultry.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.940]   So if I take the chicken raw, put it on a cutting board,
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.060]   I have now chicken all over my hands.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.100]   I'm gonna cut it.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.400]   So I have to wash the knife.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.380]   I have to wash the cutting board.
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.180]   I have to wash my hands multiple times
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.020]   if you're gonna do it correctly.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.860]   And now if I just do it in the any day,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.100]   I don't even have to wash my hands
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.460]   'cause I've never touched chicken.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.100]   I put the lid on.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.420]   I cook it for about seven and a half minutes
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.100]   so it's thawed out, but the center is still gonna be raw.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.580]   I could cook it all the way, but there's no need.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.360]   So I'm taking frozen chicken.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.700]   Usually if I have to defrost it, that's at least a day,
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.540]   but how else are you gonna defrost it?
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.940]   You have to like just leave it out.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.120]   So I've done that in seven and a half minutes to defrost it.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.920]   Now I've chopped it up in the bits.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.500]   I've taken the garlic and I've taken the shiitake mushrooms.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.620]   I've added, you know, momo soy sauce,
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.180]   some dark soy sauce, some agave, some neutral oil.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.480]   And I'm just sauteing that, added some scallions.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.020]   And as that's cooking, I added my chopped chicken
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.300]   and all the juices that accumulated
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.220]   and pretty much saute that for like a minute.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.140]   And then I add the noodles that I cooked,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.260]   re-season and I'm ready to go.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.580]   Put it back into any day
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.900]   and they're gonna reheat that for lunch.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.440]   So again, is it pretty?
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.820]   Absolutely not.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.400]   But I'm not like cooking for an audience
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.900]   other than my family.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.680]   The final product looks delicious, tastes delicious,
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.580]   but it was a roundabout way of getting there,
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.760]   but it was extremely quick.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.320]   I cooked that in 10 minutes.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.640]   The water was boiling, I microwaved the chicken.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.520]   So to do a delicious dish in 10 minutes, it's hard to beat.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.520]   - I've had a great experience
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.840]   cooking in the microwave recently this past week.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.760]   And I actually reached out to Anyday
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.280]   and they decided to offer a deal for all listeners.

[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.120]   Okay, I have a few more questions here.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.760]   Are there any other unusual things you cook in the microwave?
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.720]   - I mean, lobster, listen, I say lobster
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.600]   because that's the people go, what the fuck?
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   But the reality is, is if you just like eating vegetables,
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.440]   which you're gonna use all the time, every day.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.920]   If you have kids, it's how I cook
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.840]   almost everything for my kids as well.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.360]   Vegetables work extremely well.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.160]   Frozen vegetables work really well.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.200]   I make gravies in there and I can make a one-pot
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.280]   mac and cheese from scratch
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.840]   faster than a box mac and cheese.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.160]   That tastes way better.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.920]   But my kids probably will still wanna eat
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.280]   the box mac and cheese.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.320]   - And when you're making it,
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.200]   is it just throw in water, pasta, butter, cheese?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.080]   Like, you know, you can throw it in or?
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.020]   - Well, yeah, a lot of it's, again,
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.440]   just understanding the food science of it all.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.160]   So if I add water, just to cover the macaroni
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.920]   or any pasta shape, and I add some salt,
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.680]   but not too much salt because the salt's gonna reduce,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.520]   right, because I'm gonna evaporate most of the water away.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.360]   I'll say I put a cup and a half, two cups of pasta,
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.080]   cover it with water, maybe a couple millimeters
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.680]   over the pasta itself.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.240]   I'll pop it in the microwave, uncovered,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.800]   and it'll be there for about like nine to 10 minutes.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.240]   I will take it out.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.600]   Fat water now is going to be concentrated with starch,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   right, so it's gonna be almost viscous.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.520]   But I wanna microwave it to the point
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.080]   where most of that water has evaporated.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.280]   There is some left.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.560]   For that same reason, when you make pastas,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.440]   a lot of times you're adding at least a scoop or two
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.320]   of the pasta water back into the sauce
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.760]   because of the starch that's now in the water.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.920]   The pasta's now pretty seasoned
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   because of the amount of salt that I put in.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.640]   Now, all I need to do is make a roux
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.520]   to make a bechamel 'cause that's how you traditionally
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.320]   make macaroni and cheese.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.600]   You take flour, you take butter or some fat,
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.720]   and then you milk to it, and you thicken that up,
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.360]   turns it into a gravy more or less,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.080]   and then you can mount it with cheese,
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.880]   and that's your cheese sauce.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.920]   That's a lot of pots and pans already, right,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.240]   if you're doing it that way.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.800]   All of this is gonna be in one pot.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.520]   After nine to 10 minutes, I'm taking the pasta out.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.160]   I'm gonna throw maybe a tablespoon or two of butter
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.000]   right in there.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.640]   I'm gonna add a tablespoon of flour.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.280]   I'm gonna add a little bit of milk,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.880]   maybe like three, four tablespoons.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.560]   I'm gonna mix it up, and I'm gonna put it back
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.920]   in the microwave for about three minutes.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.360]   It's gonna come back out.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.560]   I'm gonna stir it up, and I don't have to worry about lumps
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.720]   because the macaroni itself is an agitator.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.840]   It's like every piece of macaroni is effectively a whisk,
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.920]   so all I have to do is mix it around.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.760]   I can even put the lid on and shake it up,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   and it's an extremely sort of like thick bechamel now,
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.400]   and now I can add in the cheese, and it's now ripping hot.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.560]   I add the cheese in now because it starts to cool it down
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.680]   so I can more quickly serve it to my children.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.420]   They don't have to wait, right?
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.120]   I could've added the cheese earlier.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.960]   This is all about how do we save as much time as possible?
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.800]   So I can take the cheese.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   I can liaise it with the sauce,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.420]   and I can help bring the temperature down,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.600]   and I have velvety, beautiful macaroni and cheese.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.880]   I didn't have a colander.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.320]   I didn't use a double boiler.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.480]   I didn't use a pot.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.400]   I mean, that's a four-pot, at least a four-pot endeavor
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.160]   to make home-cooked mac and cheese,
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   and I did it in 12 minutes in one pot and in any day, so.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.120]   - I love it.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.760]   Yeah, I have not gone as deep as I planned to.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.660]   One thing I've always wondered.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.400]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.240]   I get it.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.940]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.820]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.900]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.840]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.780]   and let our sponsor, Drizly,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.500]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.320]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.160]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.580]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.540]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.020]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.100]   that you got through another week.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.220]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.740]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.520]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.620]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.260]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.840]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.820]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.860]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.700]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.740]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.380]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.860]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.940]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.800]   or go to drizly.com.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.820]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.060]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.260]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.820]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.420]   And I am so excited to be partnering
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.820]   with them for this episode.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.020]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.660]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.220]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.020]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.100]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.940]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.640]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.220]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.700]   And it's not just for men.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.100]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.740]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.180]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.680]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.740]   I've ever owned.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.540]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.620]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.540]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.700]   but they're also great for lounging.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.940]   Or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.900]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.220]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.540]   - Is the microwave something
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.460]   where you have to get the time right?
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.140]   And the way I'll ask the question is,
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.200]   is six minutes, stop it and start it again for one minute,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.460]   is that the same as running it for seven minutes?
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.780]   Like, can you fine tune it
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.060]   or does it take a little bit of warmup each time?
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.060]   - I mean, the microwaving manufacturing divisions,
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.700]   like, they need to get their act together
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.460]   because they're all working off
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.620]   of different platforms, more or less.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.180]   So almost every microwave,
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.980]   even if you buy it from, say, Panasonic
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.520]   or any of the big microwave producers,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.980]   they change their wattage yearly, sometimes,
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.540]   for no time or reason.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.460]   So every microwave is gonna be different.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.780]   It really is crazy.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.780]   You need to find the wattage
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.300]   and there's a lot of different things
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.260]   you can do to find that.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.900]   But it's really getting to know your microwave.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.200]   And the wattage really has a lot to do with the time.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.780]   So the things that are gonna affect the microwave
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.780]   are no different than, say, cooking turkey.
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.220]   If you put an eight-pound turkey in,
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.200]   it's gonna cook way faster than a 28-pound turkey.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.980]   The laws of thermodynamics don't change in a microwave.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.340]   So if I put a huge piece of pork butt in
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.500]   that I'm trying to cook, it's gonna take a long time.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.700]   No matter what the wattage is on the microwave,
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.700]   it's gonna take a long time.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.260]   But again, if we're cooking pasta
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.560]   and I'm trying to bring some water to a boil,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.700]   a lot of that depends on the power of the microwave.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.300]   So some microwaves might be able to do that
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.140]   in seven minutes.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.020]   So the microwave I have in the studio
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.180]   is less powerful than the one I have at home.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.900]   So you can really screw up a recipe pretty quickly
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.940]   if you don't get it dialed in.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.660]   And the other thing people don't use
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.760]   is the power levels of a microwave.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.300]   Again, I hope to one day make a microwave,
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.300]   but the first thing I would do is change the interface
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.400]   where I don't have to press a button
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.220]   after I put in six minutes to find power level 30
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.180]   and then press start.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.300]   It's so not intuitive whatsoever.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.660]   The power level, all that is is if I say power level 30,
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.740]   it basically means for every like minute,
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.280]   it's only on 30% of that time.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.160]   So the waves are only hitting 30%, right?
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.180]   It's on 30%.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.380]   And then you can hear the microwave click on and off
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.260]   when it's at a lower power level
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.700]   'cause it's not hitting the food
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.380]   with microwaves consistently.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.420]   - So it's not actually reducing the strength,
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.220]   it's just reducing the time.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.140]   - Correct, correct.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.340]   And you can cook very, very delicate things.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.180]   You can cook some of the most beautifully steamed fish
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.020]   in a microwave.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.180]   Again, like I love steamed fish.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.140]   The older I get,
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.540]   it's not just 'cause I love Cantonese food,
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.340]   just steamed fish is just dope.
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.620]   The older I get, the more I wanna eat steamed fish,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.780]   but I don't have a double boiler
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.580]   and I'm not gonna steam fish in like a wok setup.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.980]   Like things that are easy to do in a restaurant
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.640]   are not so easy to do at home.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.380]   How often do you eat steamed fish?
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.060]   Probably not that much, right?
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.460]   - It's like almost always on a skillet.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.780]   - Right. - Or in the oven.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.100]   - And steamed fish is delicious
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.160]   when you have a nice piece of fish.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.780]   So like these are things that you can do.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.260]   I could talk about the microwave all day long,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.700]   but most people fuck up on the microwave
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.860]   by putting plastic in.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.180]   Plastic is what is bad.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.180]   - I read some of the science
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.020]   and I don't think we need to have a conversation
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.720]   about all the crazy things
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.140]   some people say about microwaves.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.700]   My mom sent me an article
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.300]   when I told her we were cooking in the microwave.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.420]   She's like, "Oh, it's 10 things
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.780]   you should never put in the microwave."
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.700]   And it was like this a little bit ridiculous article
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.220]   'cause it was like, "Well, you never wanna put this in
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.280]   'cause it might get too hot."
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.140]   And I'm like, "Well, that's not a problem with the microwave.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.280]   That's a problem with you just making something hot."
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.740]   But there's a lot of data.
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.780]   I'll put it in the show notes
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.140]   about the safety of microwaves and all these myths
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.740]   pretty much getting debunked across the board.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.700]   - Microwaves get people really mad
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.860]   and I see it with commenters on social media.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.060]   Like, "You're spreading cancer and carcinogens."
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.220]   I'm like, "What the fuck are you talking about?
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.020]   Didn't you read that article that just came out?"
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.140]   I'm like, "What article are you talking about?"
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.860]   So yeah, the microwave gets people very upset.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.220]   That's for sure.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.420]   - To go to a few other things outside of the microwave,
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.940]   let's talk a little bit about food
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.020]   and what kind of food you're buying.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.220]   You talked about fish.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.480]   How important is quality
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.780]   and are there areas where quality matters a lot,
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.300]   whether it's higher quality or organic
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.620]   and areas where it doesn't matter?
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.260]   Or how do you think about what you're shopping for?
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.980]   - Well, we can just start with fish.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.660]   Most fish in the supermarkets is hot garbage.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.580]   I mean, it just is like...
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.460]   I mean that like even the best supermarkets
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.180]   have dodgy fish markets.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.220]   It is not that way for a lot of Asia.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.820]   There are certain places that do a good job,
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.820]   like Bristol Farms does a good job with fish,
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.440]   but it's still not awesome.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.900]   I think we have a long way to go
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.920]   to sort of get to some of the best fish purchasing
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.620]   that we have in other parts of the world.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.020]   But for the most part,
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.180]   it's really hard to understand when it was caught,
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.340]   how it was handled,
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.060]   and storing it on ice and water
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.660]   is actually not what you wanna do.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.660]   You wanna keep it away from these things.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.940]   Again, how things are handled in a professional kitchen
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.060]   are very different than what you see at a supermarket.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.220]   So more often than not,
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.020]   I think sometimes the best fish
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.620]   is maybe sometimes the salt cod or the frozen fish.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.620]   I mean, I have a lot of frozen fish.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.460]   Whether it's organic or not,
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.660]   let's just worry about the quality first, right?
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.060]   The freshness levels.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.220]   I know the floor on a piece of frozen fish
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:35.180]   is way higher than the floor of a potentially fresh fish.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.800]   The ceiling is lower as well,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.980]   but at least I know exactly what I'm working with.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.740]   I do think there's probably mislabeling.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.460]   There's just a lot of the handling is wrong,
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.820]   and I think that's maybe human error,
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.620]   but I tend to buy more fresh fish
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.260]   from fish butchers that I know or from the restaurant.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.500]   There's a place in LA that's great.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.360]   It's called The Joint.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.060]   And there's a lot of fish mongers via the pandemic
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.560]   that started selling fish from wholesale originally
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.740]   to now retail.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.980]   So I think that's gonna become easier,
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.020]   but I would predict that in the next five to 10 years,
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.660]   you're gonna see wholesale changes
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.700]   in how supermarkets handle their fish, for sure.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.740]   Mainly because they're gonna have a longer shelf life
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.060]   of fish if they handle it a little bit differently.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.660]   - Well, when you say frozen fish,
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.580]   do you mean like you go to Safeway
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.640]   and you see like bags of frozen fish in the freezer section
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.940]   or is this kind of?
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.780]   - Yeah, I'll take that all day long.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.500]   I am like the worst kind of food snob.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.380]   I eat super high end stuff and super low brow stuff
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.380]   and everything in between.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.700]   What I want is a piece of fish
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.160]   that I know has been handled right.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.140]   And if it's not organic, that's fine too.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.520]   Like I have Arctic char that's frozen,
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.140]   that's not organic or wild.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.820]   I'm okay with that, right?
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.180]   Where I'm not okay with is say salmon.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.460]   I think salmon is a seasonal fish
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.580]   and it should be smoked or preserved.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.620]   Ora Kings is good and that's from New Zealand.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.460]   But for the most part,
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.580]   they're striped bass from Mexico that's farm raised.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.380]   Not all farm raised is the same.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.980]   I don't love farm raised salmon.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.240]   Mainly because of how it's raised and how it's fed.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.440]   I just try not to eat things like that.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.280]   But do I?
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.940]   Yeah, sometimes I'll go to a Trader Joe's or something
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.540]   and I'll buy some just because I know
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.020]   it's what my kid will eat.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:13.020]   And I'll take a cut of salmon that I know is okay.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.820]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.780]   It's really hard to judge the freshness on something.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.380]   I guess I just opened Pandora's box
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.980]   'cause we could talk two weeks about fish programs.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.060]   - I'll throw people the direction of your podcast
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.660]   'cause I feel like one of the most fun things
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.880]   that I've heard you do is you just go deep on one thing.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.360]   So I bet that somewhere in those episodes,
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.820]   there's something on fish or something like that.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.260]   So if anyone wants just a deep dive on any of these topics,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.360]   I bet there's something there.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.460]   So I'll throw that out.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.060]   - People should buy some salt cod.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.660]   It's a delicious thing.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.220]   Most of Europe wouldn't be here today
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.380]   if we didn't have salt cod.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.620]   So honestly, salt cod is wonderful.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.980]   They take something that was plucked from the ocean
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.140]   at its peak freshness and then preserve it in salt.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.940]   I'll eat a lot of tinned seafood too.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.980]   That's fine.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.060]   Just because you know exactly how it's processed.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.380]   And another thing is frozen vegetables get a bad rap.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.980]   But very similar to frozen fish.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.900]   I will take frozen peas over fresh peas
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.820]   any day of the week.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.740]   Because the starch content changes on peas
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.760]   unless you're literally plucking it that day
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.740]   and eating it that day.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.900]   And not everyone's so lucky to live in the Bay Area
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.940]   or Southern California
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.900]   where you might be able to get fresh peas that day.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.820]   Like there's an idea with farmers that I talked to
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.420]   like they shucked peas
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.140]   'cause that's how some chefs want it, right?
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.260]   Because that perfect sweep this level
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.000]   before the sugar turns to starch.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.260]   Well, that's a very hard product to come by.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.540]   Well, a frozen pea is literally plucked
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.740]   at its peak sugar level
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.300]   and then frozen immediately, flash frozen.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.140]   So again, the floor is definitely like higher
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.180]   than a fresh pea,
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.580]   but the ceiling is not that much lower.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.260]   So there's a lot of things if you start asking yourself,
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.780]   is it better or worse?
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.140]   I don't think that's the right question.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.440]   And even going back to fish,
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.460]   it's like, what are you looking for?
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.000]   Are you looking for a piece of fish that tastes delicious
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.320]   and that is of like high quality?
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.160]   I don't even mean,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.700]   I think freshness is the word that is important,
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.120]   but even freshness isn't the right word
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.840]   because a lot of fish I think moving forward
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.120]   is gonna be dry-aged.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.960]   So how are you going to sell a fish
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.720]   when people ask, is it fresh?
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.280]   And if you say, if I'm behind the counter,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm like, no, that's been aged 32 days.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.600]   That's gonna throw people for a loop.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.360]   - And how much of, is this thing taste good?
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.080]   Is the food or I think you said
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.840]   like one of the most important things people should learn
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.120]   is how to season things.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.840]   Is that equally more important,
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.640]   less important than the freshness?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.760]   At the end of the day, I assume,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.960]   as long as you're not getting sick,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.600]   what's most important is, does it taste good?
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.480]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.640]   The reason I talk about water
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.400]   is if you store it in ice and water,
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.520]   it sort of accelerates the production of ammonia in fish.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.720]   So it's counterintuitive to like keep fish away
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.120]   from sitting on ice, right?
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.840]   So it doesn't matter what kind of fish,
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.120]   if it tastes like ammonia, it's not gonna be delicious.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.360]   So we put that away.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.760]   Let's just say I use a block of frozen fish, right?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.120]   I get some frozen sockeye salmon.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.320]   What I'm looking at that is really is like, okay,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.120]   I could turn this into something that's tasty, right?
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.920]   In and of itself, maybe not so delicious
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.240]   as say a king salmon, but what could I do?
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.280]   I could add some soy sauce.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   I could add some herbs.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.280]   I could add a little sugar.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.640]   I could turn that into teriyaki.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.600]   So I'm just trying to always figure out
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.840]   like how do I make it tasty?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.480]   You can make good food with bad product,
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.880]   but it's really hard to do consistent, basically.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.160]   - And when you're trying to make things tasty,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.520]   do you think there's some underrated ingredients
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   that people should be keeping in their kitchens
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.600]   to make things taste better
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.280]   that they're probably not using right now?
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.240]   - I mean, yeah.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.200]   People should cook more with MSG, but they won't.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.040]   - Why?
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.600]   Like as someone who's done zero research,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.200]   other than I feel like I know that there are a lot of people
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.320]   that say no MSG, which inherently makes me assume
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.640]   it's not good, but based on what you just said,
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.600]   makes me think maybe that's totally.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.920]   - Show me one scientific report that proves
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.400]   that like MSG is actually bad for you.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.280]   - It's usually these like really faulty double blind studies
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.400]   like always a screwy study.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.720]   You can be sensitive to MSG, but you can't be allergic
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.520]   'cause it's a glutamic acid.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.120]   You die if you are allergic to glutamic acid, right?
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.360]   You need it to survive.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.760]   It just so happens that it can also be very delicious.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.840]   And when you dry age beef,
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.200]   you produce and harness more glutamic acid.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.320]   With the production of certain fermented foods
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.640]   create a lot more umami, MSG, monosodium glutamate.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.440]   So the artificial form is created
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.800]   and that's what you can sprinkle on,
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.240]   but it's naturally present in so many fucking foods.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.120]   Parmesan is basically just dairy MSG.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.880]   I've talked about it a lot in like say
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.200]   our "Ugly Delicious" episodes.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.760]   The reason I get so upset about it is
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.680]   because it's these similar to the microwave.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.160]   It's something that is widely held to be true on what?
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.480]   You know, and these are the ideas that I really like
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.640]   in food and culture in general.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.400]   I love searching for the bad ideas.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.920]   And I ask myself, why is it a bad idea?
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.720]   Is there like overwhelming data
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.400]   that supports it's a bad idea
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.720]   and the hypothesis is tested?
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.040]   Or did some dumb ass, you know,
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.080]   stupidity and bias and prejudice say it was a bad idea?
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.120]   More often than not,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.240]   those are the things that happen
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.200]   to be the things that I care about.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.360]   And MSG is one of them.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.240]   And there's a few factors that happened in the '60s
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.680]   that created a lot of the MSG syndrome stuff,
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.480]   but people eat MSG all the time.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.480]   When you eat a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.680]   and you go to get a Popeye's crispy chicken sandwich
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.200]   and people love it,
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.640]   those same person that says they're allergic to MSG,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.880]   they're eating MSG.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.440]   Almost every snack food that you get,
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.640]   delicious, delicious chips.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.840]   You know what they have?
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   MSG.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.920]   To me, it's funny because people eat it all the time,
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.800]   both naturally and artificially in their foods,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.560]   whether they realize it or not.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.440]   Yet it just so happens that if it's like Chinese food
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.800]   or Asian, then it's bad for you.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.920]   I'll leave it at this.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.960]   The marketing behind MSG and the faultiness behind it
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.120]   is so great that currently,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.600]   that if you go to any supermarket,
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.520]   people buy it all the time in MSG and it's pure form.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.240]   Uncut, pure MSG.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   It's in your supermarket right now labeled not as MSG,
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.840]   not with some dragon Asian bullshit font on the packaging.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.280]   Accent.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.080]   You ever heard of accent, the seasoning salt?
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.400]   Right now, people buy it.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.920]   They add it all the time, a lot of secret family recipes.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.720]   And if you look at it, it says the only one ingredient,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.120]   monosodium glutamate, produced by Ajinomoto,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.680]   the largest producer of MSG in the world.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.600]   So people add chicken bouillon cubes.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.440]   You know what that is?
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.520]   It's basically a cube of MSG.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.360]   I'm not saying dump MSG in.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.600]   There's things that they can do
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.240]   to make the food more delicious.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.120]   They do that with Parmesan.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.640]   People add Parmesan to everything.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.640]   Why?
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.480]   Oh, it tastes good.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.880]   Why does it taste good?
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.720]   Oh, 'cause it's Parmesan.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.680]   I was like, oh, 'cause of the buffalo milk bullshit?
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.000]   No, it's 'cause it's got a lot of glutamic acid in it.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.120]   - Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.480]   and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.960]   to your new year routine.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.440]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.720]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.440]   for over a year that sources the best coffee
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.200]   across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.040]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.680]   so you can enjoy their craft
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.440]   from the comfort of your own home
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.600]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.920]   Sign up for a subscription
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.560]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.680]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.880]   just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.120]   And over the past year,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.960]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.400]   But this last bag of beans
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.080]   from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.240]   it's called Bark the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.120]   So jumpstart this year by signing up
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.400]   for a Trade subscription.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.680]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.520]   with select subscription plans
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.160]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.880]   That's allthehacks.com/trade
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.600]   for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.160]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.760]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.480]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.320]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.920]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.480]   without our consent.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.240]   I found a listing for my dad
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.400]   on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.520]   that had his name, age, address, phone number,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.240]   email, past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.280]   And that was just one of the 69 listings
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.760]   that had his info.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.920]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.720]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.880]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.480]   I got it all done in minutes
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.120]   with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.040]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.360]   with them for this episode.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.160]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.920]   that will not just find and remove
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.440]   your personal information
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.240]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.600]   but they'll continuously scan for new data
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.000]   that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.920]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.280]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.800]   in their first two years,
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.280]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.600]   of data for their customers.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.680]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.160]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.200]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.800]   and get 20% off a plan for you
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.720]   or your entire family.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.680]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.960]   I just wanna thank you quick
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.240]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.080]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.800]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.560]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.120]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.360]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.440]   So MSG, any other things you keep out a lot
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.640]   to either spice things, flavor things?
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.320]   For me, I could probably put gochujang
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.880]   on a lot of things and my kids will never eat it,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.960]   but we use that a lot in our house.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.720]   - We use a lot of olive oil.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.360]   I have like several kinds of olive oils at home,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.040]   mainly for like health benefits
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.320]   'cause I have to eat certain diets
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.920]   'cause as I get older, my cholesterol,
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.280]   but in general, I think olive oil is a beautiful thing
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.000]   because there's so many flavors and heats to it,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.240]   especially if it's fresh or fruity.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.680]   There's cooking olive oils.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.080]   There's dressing olive oils and everything in between.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.640]   So I think for me, it's like a baseball pitch.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.160]   I have like three olive oils on hand all the time,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.560]   one to cook with.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.440]   And again, like I'm not cooking with the super fragrant,
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.400]   very expensive olive oil
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.320]   because all those fragile compounds that make it delicious
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.520]   will be destroyed in that violent cooking process.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.760]   So there's no reason to do that.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.360]   I mean, besides the own Momo products,
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.320]   I use savory salt in everything
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.040]   and that doesn't have MSG
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.880]   because there's other ways to harness it.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.240]   The one thing I don't add all the time
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.920]   to my food is black pepper.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.840]   I just don't do it blindly and religiously
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.320]   like everybody else.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.840]   Salt and fat are the two big difference makers,
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.160]   if I had to think quickly,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.600]   with home cooking versus professional cooking.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.000]   The amount of salt and the amount of fat
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.800]   used in a professional kitchen is quite frankly gross
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   compared to what you would use in a home kitchen.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.920]   - And you talk about pepper and spices.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.440]   Do you use spices a lot?
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.160]   Like do you have, the average American home
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.840]   has the spice rack with 25 different things.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.440]   - Yeah, I mean, that's another thing,
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.880]   whether it's La Boite or SOS Chefs,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.080]   there's so many great spice shops.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.400]   I tend to stay away from like the stuff.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.240]   Do I have like garlic powder and onion powder
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.080]   and stuff like that?
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.400]   Yeah, but do I have a kefir lime leaf
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.160]   and do I have razza whole new,
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.560]   do I have different spice blends?
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.960]   Absolutely, and I think black cardamom, green cardamom,
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.400]   things that I purchase in small amounts,
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.960]   mainly because it has a shelf life
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.560]   and there's no reason to buy a large amount
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.280]   because by the time I get to the end of it,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.800]   it will have gone bad.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.200]   So I have a lot of small jars of like one or two,
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.680]   like I have two pods of cardamom.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.560]   I have like two things of cinnamon.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.600]   - I would imagine that the average person listening
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.880]   right now has not replaced the spices
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.840]   in their spice rack for over a decade.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.920]   - Well, longer than that, I'd probably say,
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.280]   some people right now, I bet you,
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.240]   if you look into your spice rack,
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.760]   if you bought an existing home,
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.480]   there's probably the spices of the previous owner
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.320]   still there.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.040]   - So I have talked in a past episode about,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.600]   you're not gonna get the flavor you want
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.040]   out of dried oregano if it's 25 years old.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.120]   - It dissipates.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.960]   Like I don't understand why people would think
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.040]   that it doesn't.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.040]   If film and cinema like degrades over time,
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.480]   why would it like a spice?
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.520]   It just does.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.000]   I think spice is a huge thing.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.400]   Spices in general are an amazing way to unlock flavor.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.680]   For home cook too, like the freezer.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.960]   I don't think people use the freezer enough as a pantry.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.600]   I view anything as a freezer
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.640]   as almost like a shelf-stable product.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.640]   And freezing foods are the best way to preserve
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.640]   and to ensure quality.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.680]   So whenever I cook at home now,
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.840]   whether it's an any day or not,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.480]   like I made chicken soup and I hate throwing food away.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.080]   So I'll serve enough chicken soup for dinner for the night,
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.320]   even though I'm not home, it's all set up.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.520]   And then I'll preserve the other half
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.680]   into smaller containers and put them in the freezer.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.320]   So I can just reheat that at any time.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.440]   So that's a huge tip.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.080]   People don't use the freezer enough
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.720]   'cause I think it gets a bad rap.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.320]   - I mean, when it comes to kids, we'd be like,
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.160]   "Okay, well let's make oatmeal
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.320]   and then freeze like small pieces of it
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.120]   so that you could throw in the microwave
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.520]   and heat it up real quick."
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.440]   If we make a lasagna, double the recipe,
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.440]   make a massive lasagna and freeze half of it.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.360]   - Exactly.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.040]   Well, another thing on reheating, just for people,
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.200]   not all ceramic is good in a microwave.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.760]   Most are, depending on the glaze, but not all plates.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.640]   This is another bullshit thing.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.240]   If you look on say Amazon or most places that sell a plate
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.760]   that says it's microwave safe,
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.040]   they're straight up fucking lying.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.200]   'Cause if it's plastic, it's plastic.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.760]   And there's a ton of stuff out there that's plastic
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.920]   that says it's microwave safe
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.400]   and it's not microwave safe 'cause it's still plastic.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.880]   Even containers that you might buy as a microwave dinner
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.600]   in a plastic that says it's microwave safe,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.120]   it's not microwave safe.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.160]   I wouldn't microwave in that plastic.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:19.040]   And the only things you can microwave safely are silicone,
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.840]   certain shapes of metal and glass, that's it.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.200]   - Yeah, I think the metal one will throw people,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.960]   but that's for another conversation.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.800]   You talked about how you could just cook chicken
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.160]   straight out of the freezer.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.200]   I think one of the things that we've found ourselves
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.120]   is you buy ingredients and you're like,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.840]   "Oh, it's expiring, throw it in the freezer."
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.280]   Is there an argument to just put it in the freezer
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.320]   right out the gate?
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.920]   If you're not sure if you're gonna use it for a while?
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.960]   - Yeah, that's basically how my mother cooked.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.280]   She was like, "First in, first out,"
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.920]   instead of, "Last in, first out."
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.760]   - Yeah, my grandparents did a little bit of that,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.800]   but then sometimes you'd be like,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.080]   "This thing expired two years ago."
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.680]   - Yeah, I mean, it's crazy because sometimes I find myself
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.520]   doing the same thing.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.040]   Like, let's just say it was like block of cheese.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.360]   My mom would buy so much damn cheese
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.640]   and then freeze all of it.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.920]   Buy a new block of cheese, take out the frozen one
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.400]   and put the fresh one in the freezer.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.160]   I find myself doing some things like that, for sure.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.320]   - So let me ask you a few rapid fire things,
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.760]   'cause I know you have some strong opinions
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.680]   that are a little contrarian.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.640]   Peeling?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.760]   - Not for everything.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.400]   I mean, peeling carrots, I think, is dumb, for sure.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.720]   - No, I mean, that's what people are here for,
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.800]   is like, "What am I doing wrong?
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.680]   "How could I be more efficient?"
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.520]   - I mean, yeah, just take a clean sponge
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.680]   and you can wipe it down.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.720]   I mean, carrot peeling, for example,
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.560]   even potatoes, if you just wash it,
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.720]   but a lot of it's just aesthetics,
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.360]   but a lot of that flavor's in the skin itself.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.200]   - What about ginger?
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.080]   I feel like that's the most pain in the ass thing to peel.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.360]   - No, ginger's easy to peel if you just use a spoon.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.840]   How do you peel ginger?
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   - I've peeled with a spoon,
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.720]   but sometimes the ginger's, like, so small.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.460]   If you get a big piece of ginger, great.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.760]   If you get one of those, like, fraggle all around,
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.320]   like, trying to dig around and break off the nubs
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.400]   and all that stuff, I'm like...
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   - But you gotta peel with the right amount of pressure.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.040]   Even with a spoon, if you peel it,
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.040]   you can cut through those knobs with the spoon.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.680]   But in general, sometimes if I'm lazy,
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   I'm not peeling the ginger.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.200]   I'll just give it a quick wash.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.280]   - Fruit, wash all fruit?
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.400]   - Yeah.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.640]   If I go to the farmer's market
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.440]   and I get, like, berries and blackberries and raspberries,
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.280]   I don't wash them.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.280]   I wash them before I'm gonna eat them.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.760]   - My wife has been experimenting
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.840]   with what's the way to make berries last the longest.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.880]   And, like, the answer is not wash them
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.440]   and put them in the fridge wet.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.760]   It's, like, get them as dry as possible.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.920]   Like, put a paper towel around them.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.800]   Do what you can.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.000]   That gives them a lot of extra shelf life, we've found.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.360]   I feel like I grew up in a house
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.160]   where it's, like, you get a chicken breast or chicken thigh,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.400]   and it's, like, trim off all the fat of the chicken
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.040]   and then cook it.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:45.960]   Waste of time?
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.320]   Or are you trimming all that fat off?
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.360]   - That's a sad dinner, or whatever that is.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.280]   That's your friend.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.520]   Why do you wanna cut that out?
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.400]   It's for your life.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.960]   It's ridiculous.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.760]   - Okay, and then last, you talked a lot about kids.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.120]   Any tricks for people with kids
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.640]   that have made your life easier?
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.080]   - I'm probably not the right person to ask,
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.760]   'cause I think if they ever develop
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.320]   some kind of eating disorder, it's because of me.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.000]   'Cause I make them whatever they want.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.600]   I'm the worst kind of parent.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.200]   They tell you, offer one thing to your child,
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   and if they don't want it, then you should just, like,
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   hold it aside 'til they eat it later.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.040]   Not me.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.880]   I can't.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.600]   I end up making, like, sometimes four things.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.640]   (laughs)
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   Five things until they eat something.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.400]   Because as a parent, all you want to see
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.120]   is them consuming some kind of calories.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.280]   That's all I want.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.680]   I've been known to make quite a few things quickly for them,
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.040]   and I think they understand the power
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   that they wield over me now.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.320]   But I would say, as a quick thing to try for your kids,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.160]   is a crepe.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.280]   Do you make crepes for your kids?
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.000]   - I don't think I've ever made a crepe for my kids.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.680]   I've made it before kids, but.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.240]   - All right, well, again, there's restaurant crepes,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.640]   and then there's home cooking crepes.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.480]   And most of the things I say that I cook at home,
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.040]   I would never cook it that way in a restaurant, right?
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.960]   In a restaurant, you need a specific shape
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.160]   and thickness and aesthetic.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.320]   So you need one egg to one cup of milk
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.720]   to one cup of flour, basically.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.400]   And you could add olive oil or some kind of butter,
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.680]   melted butter, and I put that into, like, a little blender,
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.000]   and that's it.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.360]   Very, very quick.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.920]   On a nonstick pan or a black steel,
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.760]   you just pour a little bit over medium heat,
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.480]   and then, so you want to get the right thickness,
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.760]   but it doesn't matter.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.760]   You just want to get as thin as layer as possible.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.720]   And then now you can turn that into just about anything.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.480]   I can turn that into sort of crepe pancakes.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   So it's not necessarily traditionally pancakes,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.240]   but then I can sort of roll them up
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.320]   like they're a crepe Suzette or something like that.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.360]   And then, just what I'm trying to do
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.920]   with something that is like a crepe
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.480]   is constantly change the shape and form of it
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.920]   so it looks like it's different to them,
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.320]   and put different feelings in.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.040]   So if it's a crepe,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.400]   then I can get it more crunchy on the bottom.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.880]   I can get it super crisp, like it's almost like a tortilla,
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.880]   and I can put cheese and ham,
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.600]   and I could turn that into like a crepe quesadilla-like thing.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.400]   Or I could even crack a scrambled egg in there,
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.280]   put some cheese and some bacon, and roll that up.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.280]   So it gives me a lot of flexibility.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.760]   And I found that if you are sort of stuck in your ways
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.520]   of presenting something to a child,
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.160]   then you're gonna be limited.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.840]   And I think being able to tweak things on a daily basis
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.160]   prevents them from getting bored from eating.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.680]   So the crepe is the only thing left in my pitching arsenal
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.840]   that they still can't hit.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.760]   (laughs)
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.080]   - And part of this is just getting comfortable
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.000]   with experimenting.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.680]   Any words of wisdom to someone who feels like,
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.920]   gosh, they have to follow a recipe
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.920]   for everything they're doing?
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.600]   - Well, we wrote a book during the pandemic,
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.920]   "Cooking at Home."
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.960]   And I posit, even though it sounds ridiculous,
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.720]   that recipes are actually responsible for bad cooking.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.640]   Because if you follow recipes, and I see this a lot,
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.520]   like if I post something, or I make something,
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.200]   and someone's like, oh, how'd you make that?
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.880]   And I give them like, I did this, this, and this,
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.200]   and they ask like, no, what are the exact measurements?
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.880]   Most of the best cooking in the world
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.640]   happens with no recipes.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.440]   It just so happens that in America
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.040]   and some of the Western world,
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.560]   people can't cook without recipes.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.280]   I find it that long-term, it probably hurts your ability
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.920]   to develop intuition.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.280]   And I love recipes to a degree,
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   but I also think that they're not the best thing for you
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.440]   if you wanna learn how to be a better cook.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.120]   Because if you're cooking at home,
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   it's improv every night.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.360]   It's not a scripted Broadway play.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.640]   - Or at least it should be, maybe.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.800]   We did something a little crazy.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.280]   Neither my wife or I are Korean,
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.320]   but there's this thing, you probably know it,
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.960]   it's like, "Somchil Il."
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.200]   It's like the 21 days after you have a baby,
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.120]   someone comes to lose you.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.160]   So we'd learned about this and we thought,
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.560]   well, that sounds like something great.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.960]   Like someone's helping take care of mom and the baby.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.160]   So we hired this woman to live with us
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.560]   for, I think it was like 30 days after our baby was born.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.600]   We did it again.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.280]   She then went and did it with both my sister's kids
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.720]   and no recipes.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.080]   For 30 days, she cooked three meals a day,
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.760]   zero recipes the entire time.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.840]   And we were like, "Oh, we're doing it all wrong."
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.080]   She was like, "What if I try to make a pizza
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.840]   "out of a kimchi pancake?"
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   It was just so creative.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.520]   And I don't know, it just changed our perspective
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.360]   on how we cook.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.640]   - Well, I'm glad you got the sangheuri.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.360]   Sangheuri is the pronunciation.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.960]   But it's like the fourth trimester is a big deal in Korea.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.240]   Yeah, I'm glad that you did that.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.360]   But also, my mom never gave me a single recipe.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.040]   I wish she did sometimes, right?
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.600]   But if you have a recipe that you want from your mom
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.560]   or your aunt or your uncle,
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.040]   I think what you find more often than not,
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.120]   what I'm guilty of, and I'm sure everyone else is,
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.920]   "Hey, text your mom.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.520]   "Hey, can you tell me how you make that dish?"
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.840]   And then, "Can you give me specifics?"
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.480]   I think probably what would be more impactful,
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.200]   and I don't wanna seem cheesy or hokey,
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.560]   is get on a flight, spend a long weekend,
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.800]   and make it with them.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.000]   That's what I think is missing in a lot of these things,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.200]   is the recipe can actually prevent you
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.480]   from actually learning how to actually make it right.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.400]   For example, I've lived in Los Angeles for two years,
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.200]   and I don't know the names of any of the fucking highways,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.080]   because all I do is follow GPS, right?
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.560]   I'm never going to follow the names.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.280]   People ask me, "Hey, you just go on Wheelshare,
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.120]   "and you're here?"
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.080]   I was like, "I don't know, and I'm never gonna know."
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.680]   I understand that most people's cooking
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.520]   is like car GPS for them.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.480]   - I know you're not focused as much on the restaurant thing,
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.680]   but I asked some listeners
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.080]   if there's any questions I should ask you.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.120]   One thing people want to know is,
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.840]   when you go to a restaurant,
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.800]   how do you decide what to eat?
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.000]   Is it just whatever you want,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.160]   or are you trying to figure out what the best thing is,
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.040]   and what tactics do you have for someone who's like,
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.400]   "I wanna find a great restaurant, have a great dish,
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   "and I don't know anyone."
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.160]   It's not like I'm friends with the chef.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.840]   - I think first and foremost, probably do some research,
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.080]   but don't just follow Yelp, right?
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.640]   Or let's just say you do follow Yelp,
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.280]   and you find that there is sort of truth
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.840]   to say a restaurant that has a three-star rating,
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.360]   or like a three-and-a-half-star rating,
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.160]   but that restaurant has a lot of fives and a lot of ones.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.840]   That right off the bat looks something
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.000]   that's probably gonna be awesome, right?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.680]   If you dive deeper into the data,
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.880]   and you realize most of the people that give it ones
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.240]   are people that don't understand the kind of cuisine.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.640]   Most of the people that give it fives
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.520]   are the people that do understand the cuisine.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.440]   That's probably a good thing.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.440]   So the numbers don't always tell you the truth,
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.800]   what's behind it.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   I also think it's probably best to just use the guides
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.320]   that are there to do your own discovery.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.720]   Finding what's best is sort of ridiculous.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   And I know that's easy to sell and easy to explain,
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.400]   but for example, if you go to Tokyo,
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.240]   and you go to any of the really sushi expert aficionados,
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.880]   right, that I know,
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.960]   if you say, "Hey, I wanna go to the best sushi restaurant,"
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.800]   they're gonna erase you from their phone,
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.400]   'cause this is like, you're just a dumbass to them.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.120]   It's so overreductive.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.640]   I think what they wanna say is like,
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.960]   "Do you understand the nuance?"
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.920]   And to understand that at any given moment,
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.680]   there might be like five to seven
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.720]   serving the best stuff that night.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.920]   So a lot of it is like the feeling, the price range.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.320]   And I think doing the homework never hurts,
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.960]   but the best thing to do is just to go out there
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.800]   and do it yourself.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.280]   And I think the hard thing clearly is,
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.280]   people are on a budget
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.920]   and they can't go eat out all the time.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.520]   So I think at that degree,
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.160]   it really doesn't hurt to go to the places
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.720]   that are like tried and true.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.440]   For example, in New York, if people were saying,
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.320]   "Hey, where do I go?
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.440]   "My parents are there.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.760]   "Grandparents are coming."
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.600]   And like, "It's a good celebration for like eight of us."
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.360]   And they really wanna like blow it out.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.040]   I'd say like, "Go to La Bernardin."
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.120]   Or even if it's late, "Go to La Bernardin."
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.360]   Because like, it's the kind of restaurant
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.480]   that can make everyone happy.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.320]   And it's delicious.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.600]   And it's not like a four-hour tasting menu.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.880]   If my friend who I know likes to spend a lot
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.720]   of their disposable income on high-end restaurants,
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.560]   and I know that like they're coming to town
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.240]   and they want something, I'm just like,
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.200]   "Okay, I got a table at Brooklyn Fair."
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.800]   Each restaurant probably has a purpose, right?
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.920]   Some are catch-alls, some are specific.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.440]   If I was in San Francisco,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.560]   we'll think about Corey Lee, the great chef, my good friend.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.180]   He has Banu, and he has San Juan, the Korean barbecue spot.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.560]   One is for a specific occasion, for dining.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.640]   Dining is very different than eating.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.720]   Dining is feeding your brain simultaneously,
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.820]   and eating is San Juan, which is delicious,
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.660]   and everyone gets it.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.000]   So again, part of it is understanding and reading the room.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.520]   I think before you even figure out where to go
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.000]   is like, "Who am I eating with?"
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.960]   And like, "What is the desired result?"
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   And if you're thinking like,
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.440]   "Hey, I just wanna check the box.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.780]   "I wanna go to a three-mission-star restaurant,"
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.720]   then like the mission guide isn't always the best indicator,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.960]   but it gives you a sense of what is there.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.880]   And even all those lists give you a sense
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.400]   of where to go and what to eat.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.280]   But at the end of the day, I think going in the chat rooms,
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.520]   just reading everything possible.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.760]   Instagram is a great, great feed.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.200]   Like if you find gourmands out there, if you follow them,
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.240]   like Little Meg in Japan is a perfect example.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.680]   I think she's one of the great connoisseurs
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.720]   of food in the world.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.920]   Where she eats is the good shit.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.480]   And that's what we have right now.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.100]   We live in a world where you have instant information
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.640]   to a degree, and you have people
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.400]   that are doing the work for you.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.240]   You just gotta find those people first.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.760]   So before even going online,
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.240]   I would probably find the people that you follow,
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.800]   that you might, like, you get a sense of,
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.240]   oh, if they like something, I might like something too.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.680]   And they're almost like a proxy.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.920]   So that's another recommendation that I would have.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.200]   Follow people online.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   - One tactic I have always used is find a restaurant
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.440]   that you like, five, 10 years, and go look it up online.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.720]   And invariably, there's probably a restaurant you like
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.320]   that's like a three-star restaurant.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.920]   And you're like, whoa, it breaks your brain
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.640]   because you just assume that a three-star restaurant
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.240]   on Yelp might be bad.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.880]   And it just changed my perspective.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.120]   I was like, oh, I actually like this restaurant.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   The internet says it's not a great restaurant,
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.240]   so maybe I don't always have to trust the internet.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.400]   - I'm looking for the either/or numbers, right?
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.120]   If it's a three-star restaurant where every review's a three,
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.200]   that's probably not for me.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.640]   I'm looking for, wow, you either love it or hate it.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.480]   - Cool.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.040]   When I was doing some homework, I was looking at,
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.240]   you got a show coming out on Hulu,
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.880]   and you mentioned you could cook with anything.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.200]   And I watched this one scene in it
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.080]   where someone's cooking with, like, a closed steamer.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.000]   So talk a little bit about "Secret Chef,"
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.840]   because I didn't get a preview, I didn't get to watch it,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.680]   but it looks pretty interesting.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.040]   - This was a show that we were working on for a while.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.920]   So I was excited.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.160]   I can't believe of all the pitches that we made for Hulu
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.720]   that they actually said yes to this one
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.680]   because it was the most insane one.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.680]   It was also gonna be the one that was a big budget
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.920]   and we were gonna need a giant soundstage.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.040]   So we shot it down in Atlanta
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.680]   where they shoot Marvel films and everything,
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.520]   like these huge airport hangars.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.160]   And we built this crazy setup
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.360]   where the contestants never saw each other
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.280]   while they were cooking without revealing too much.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.040]   And then as the challenges happened,
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.520]   what we wanted to do was make it where it was a game.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.720]   It wasn't just about the food.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:35.480]   The food was a vehicle for the contestants to play a game.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.280]   So it was different kinds of strategy
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.080]   and different elements that I don't think you've ever seen
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.960]   in a food reality show thing.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.800]   And I was excited about the challenges we put them in
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.520]   because I think they're very fresh
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.480]   and they're things that you've definitely not seen on camera.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.880]   And if you haven't seen it,
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.520]   I don't even know what I'm embargoed to say or not to say.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:58.400]   So I'm gonna err on the side of being conservative here
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.000]   because I don't want to get Disney upset.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.520]   But one of those challenges,
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.960]   I will say that we gave everybody household products,
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.400]   things that you would not normally cook with
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.720]   to make a meal out of.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.480]   And one of which was a clothing steamer.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.960]   And they were supposed to cook
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.120]   something beautiful with that, possible.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.200]   I saw that in the trailer,
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.760]   but I don't know what they came up with.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.280]   So I'll have to check it out.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.920]   - It's a fun show, "Secret Chef."
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.280]   I was really excited that we could finally get that out
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.360]   in the world.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.200]   - Awesome.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.800]   Anywhere else you want to point people?
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.160]   - We have some stuff coming out with Major Delma Media.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.760]   We have some products.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.880]   We have some more shows coming out.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.960]   We have the podcast and we have a few things coming out
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.680]   on the Momofuku side from the consumer product goods
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.360]   and from the restaurant side coming up soon as well.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.680]   So just stay tuned.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.240]   - I'll put a link to all that in the show notes
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.320]   and thank you so much for being here.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.360]   - Thank you, Chris.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.120]   - Wow, I learned so much in this episode.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.920]   And while technically I got a jumpstart
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   cooking more in the microwave last week,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.960]   I'm even more excited to keep it up.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.840]   And if you're excited to do the same,
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.240]   I did reach out to Anyday to set up a special deal
