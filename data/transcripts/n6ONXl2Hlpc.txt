[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, John Piper is a Christian. That's not a secret.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   But how was he converted? When was he converted? Where was he converted?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   All questions you want to know. And I see them in the inbox with frequency.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   And they are questions I think I can help answer today in a sermon clip from a 1998 sermon on the book of Romans.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Here Pastor John is sharing the story of his life as it's been woven into the book of Romans.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And as the book of Romans has been woven into his life. It's a very close relationship, obviously.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Here's what Pastor John said.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I don't remember my conversion. I was six, my daddy tells me.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   At my mother's knee in Fort Lauderdale, Florida at a motel on vacation in 1952.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   All I remember is believing. I've always believed as far as I can remember.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I'm sure that's not true since we come into the world bent out of shape by sin.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   But whatever God did in my life to make me a believer, he did so early I don't remember it happening.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   A lot of you in this room are in that position and you sort of regret it because you don't have any stunning testimonies to tell about how you were saved.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   However, I learned what happened to me from Romans.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I'm going to tell you what happened to me. I don't need to remember.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I know from the Bible what happened to me. And as I say what happened to me,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   would those of you in this room right now who wonder if it's happened to you, listen carefully.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   We prayed downstairs that at this point in the service, not just at the end, but at this moment right now in the next 60 seconds, God would save people.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   That's how it happens.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   God breaks through the Word. He makes plain the gospel and the need and the glory and the sufficiency and he does it.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   There are four things.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   One, all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Romans 3.23.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Two, the wages of sin is death.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Romans 6.23.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Third, God demonstrates his love for us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Romans 5.8.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Therefore, if you will confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Where is that found? Romans 10.9.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Romans 10.9.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So even though I don't remember what happened to me, I know what happened to me from the book of Romans.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   The book of Romans interprets life, life that you don't even know about, you read about in the book of Romans.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I went to college 1964 thinking I'd be a doctor, maybe a veterinarian if my hands shook too much.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Doesn't matter if you make a mistake on a dog.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's really the way I thought.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   In September 1966, in a painful and precious providence, I was in the hospital for three weeks and God changed my life's direction powerfully, irreversibly.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I testify now these 32 years later.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   He moved me from that trajectory to the trajectory of the ministry of the word.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Won't detail about it, but you can read about it in future grace.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Point I want to make is this, that fall I had planned to move into a dormitory suite with three other guys and did.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   But in January 1967, it was very plain to me, this is not the best circumstance for what God's doing in my life.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I want to study, I want to pray, I want to think, and this dynamic here is not ideal.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So I made a special mid-year plea and was allowed to move to Elliott Hall alone in a single room.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I lived in a single room for the next year and a half so that I could pursue God and read and pray.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And I can almost smell it and I can sure see it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's yellow, big black print on the front, nothing very fancy in those days on paperbacks, written by John Stott called "Men Made New."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   An exposition of Romans 5, 6, 7, and 8.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And I can remember reading those pages at my desk in that room like it was yesterday because of the powerful work that was going on in my life,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   confirming what happened in September of 1966, that this is my life.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   This is my life.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   This handling of the Word of God is what I want to do more than anything.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I want to know this book, though John Stott knows Romans 5 to 8.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   So Romans became not only the interpretation of my conversion, it became the confirmation of my calling to the ministry.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Then came seminary, 1968 to 1971 in Pasadena, and the cataclysmic effect of two great classes.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   There were more than two, but two great ones.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Romans 1 to 8 with Daniel Fuller, where phrase by phrase for 14 weeks, my mind was blown.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And then the climactic class called Unity the Bible, in which Romans 9 to 11 became the substructure of reality,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and all the pieces were put in place that have never changed to this day.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   The great discoveries of the sovereignty of God over all things, and the magnifying of his name,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and the enjoying him, and thus magnifying him, because that's the end for which God created the world.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Everything fell into place with Romans being the foundation on which it all stood.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Three years in Germany to study, six years at Bethel College, over and over again returning to this theme of the sovereignty of God,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   and over and over again watching Romans 9 move into center stage with controversy back and forth about what this chapter is all about.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   These awesome, awesome pictures of the sovereign freedom of God as a creator.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   In the fall of 1979, I was given a sabbatical, and I knew what I had to do with this sabbatical.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I had to settle it. What is Romans 9 saying about this God?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Because if it's saying what it looks like it's saying, then many people don't know the true God.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   So for four months I labored, and out of that laboring came something totally unexpected, namely the call to the pastorate.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   What God said in a sentence over and over again, long about October, November, is this. "I, the God of Romans 9, will be heralded and not just analyzed or explained."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   "I, the God of Romans 9, John Piper, will be proclaimed and heralded, not just analyzed and explained."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   October 14, 1979, late at night, and God came.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And it was one of those times that was like the time that Blaise Pascal had.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   He wrote it down after it had happened, and he sewed it into his coat, and he wore it the rest of his life next to his heart.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Midnight. Fire is the way Pascal said it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And I just went back yesterday and read my seven pages that I wrote for those several hours that night, and it begins like this.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   "I am closer tonight to actually deciding to resign at Bethel and take a pastorate than I have ever been."
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   The urge is almost overwhelming, and by 1 a.m. it was overwhelming.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   It takes this form. "I am enthralled by the reality of God and the power of his word to create authentic people."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That was my call away from Bethel to the pastorate.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   And then in the providence of God, this church called. Marvin Anderson.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And I answered the phone, and I didn't know where this church was.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And he explained they were in a search process, and I began to talk, and by February it was done.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And in June 1980, I came.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   So I date my conversion, or I understand my conversion, my theological foundations in seminary,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   my call to the ministry and its confirmation, and my turn from being a teacher to a preacher and a pastor,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   all out of the milieu created by the book of Romans.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Amazing. Explains why Romans is so interwoven into Piper's life and his ministry.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   He was saved at the age of six, or as he says in APJ 158, "God saved me out of a life of drugs and crime and sex when I was six years old."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   That's such a great perspective on finding our identity based on what God tells us he has done in us and who he is for us,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   particularly in a book like Romans.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I pulled this clip from John Piper's April 26, 1998 sermon titled "The Author of the Greatest Letter Ever Written."
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   If you have a sermon clip for me, email me your name, hometown, the sermon title, and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Tell me what stands out to you in it.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Well, can God read our thoughts? Yes, he can. He sure can.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And not only can he read our thoughts, he can read the intentions of our heart as well.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So what are the implications of this? Many.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Pastor John will dive into them on Friday. He and I will see you then. Thanks for listening.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   [END]
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   [END]
