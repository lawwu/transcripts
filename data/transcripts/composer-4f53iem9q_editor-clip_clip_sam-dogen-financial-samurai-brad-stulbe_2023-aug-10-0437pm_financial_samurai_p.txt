[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   And in this episode, I have a special guest with me, Brad Stolberg, author of his newly
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.040]   written book, Master of Change.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.320]   Welcome to the podcast, Brad.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.960]   Sam, it's great to be here.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960]   Well, thanks for coming on.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.440]   The reason why I wanted you on was initially because I read your previous book, The Practice
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.840]   of Groundedness, which was very helpful during the pandemic.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.800]   Because during the pandemic, it was quite chaotic.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.600]   You didn't really know what was going on.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.040]   And I read the book, and you were with Portfolio Penguin Random House at the time, as was I.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.120]   And I thought, wow, this made me feel pretty good.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.700]   So I'm excited to talk to you about your new book, Master of Change.
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.560]   Why did you decide to write Master of Change?
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:55.720]   I think that it started off as just a personal inquiry and curiosity around change and conventional
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   ways of thinking about change and stress testing those.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.680]   So over the past five years in my own life, I've undergone all sorts of change.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.680]   I became a father for the first time, moved across the country, suffered an injury that
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.560]   led to pretty significant orthopedic surgery that ended my career in a sport that had been
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.960]   a real outsized part of my identity.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.840]   I was doing some contract work with large corporations, and I decided that I'm ready
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.640]   just to go at it on my own completely as an author.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.880]   And then became a father again for the second time.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880]   Oh, congrats.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.280]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.880]   Within the last five, six years, it just seems like there was all of this change that was
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.880]   very compressed.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360]   And I was talking to other people, and they're like, yeah, it's just like things just feel
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.620]   like they happen fast, and they never stop.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.800]   And then, of course, this is against the backdrop of the pandemic, which is a significant disorder,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.960]   disruption, chaos, change, whatever you want to call it, that we all live through and was
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.360]   a challenge for all of us in many similar ways and also in unique ways.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.320]   And I distinctly remember when I decided that I wanted to dive deep into change.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.360]   I was in my kitchen here in Asheville, North Carolina, and it was midday, and I was just
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.760]   doing what I do midday, which is sometimes taking a break to read.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.960]   And went to the New York Times.com, and the headline was about getting back to normal.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.440]   Went to the WallStreetJournal.com.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.480]   The headline was about getting back to normal.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.840]   Saw The Economist.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.040]   When are we going to get back to normal?
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.520]   And it occurred to me that getting back to normal is probably never going to happen.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.280]   And why do we conceive of change as something that we want to get back to where we were?
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.480]   And this was about three, three and a half years ago, and that started this – what
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.760]   started off as just a personal project and then became a book into looking at some of
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   the historical roots of why we think about change the way that we do and exploring if
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.320]   there are alternative, better models.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   >> Right.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   In your book and in your previous book, you actually talked about going through a session
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.940]   of OCD, severe OCD for eight months, and then what you call secondary depression.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.440]   Can you talk about how that came to be?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.080]   Was it a sudden onset or have you been feeling this kind of OCD lingering for a while?
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.600]   And how did that motivate you to write this book and try to help others?
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.720]   >> That's right.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.160]   So that's a big part of the practice of groundedness, which is the book that came
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.840]   prior to this.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.360]   And let's see, right around – that was what, 29, 30?
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.440]   So this is almost seven years ago now, over seven years ago.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.040]   It was a very stark onset.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.920]   I didn't have a history of mental illness.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.280]   I was wired to be a pusher and I am probably a very – I'd score high in conscientiousness
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   in terms of a personality test or temperament.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.880]   But it was always something that was productive for me.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.160]   I was always able to channel that.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.680]   And for whatever reason, things went haywire and I descended really quickly into a very
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.520]   rough, utterly debilitating, to be honest, spot with obsessive compulsive disorder and
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.760]   then secondary depression.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.160]   And when I was going through that, there was no thinking about writing books.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   Like my whole goal was just to survive.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.000]   I was so fortunate that I had great care from a psychiatrist and a therapist.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.240]   However, when I got to the other side of that, I of course did look back and say like, "Huh,
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.960]   I want to explore more about why this happened and how this happened and also some of the
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.840]   tools that I learned in my journey in recovery and how these tools can apply more broadly
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.640]   to people that aren't even necessarily struggling with clinical mental illness."
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.040]   And I didn't mention that because that was like seven years ago.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.960]   But talk about another big life change, cruising along, performing really well, just completely,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.200]   utterly upended by mental illness.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.400]   Go through that and then recover and have that perspective.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   So I guess we can just add that to the list of these pretty significant changes that I
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   underwent.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.080]   I feel like there's been a lot of discussion on mental illness since the pandemic began,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.240]   especially loneliness, mental illness.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.720]   I feel like society, at least here in the United States, is really a striving culture,
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   go, go, go.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560]   You're seeking accolades, achievements and so forth.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.880]   How much do you think that part of achievement and success drove you to have this episode
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880]   of OCD?
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.480]   It's a good question and I think about that a lot.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.560]   And the short answer is I don't think at all, to be totally frank and honest.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   I think the experience of true clinical OCD is so far removed from what I thought being
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.960]   neurotic or anxious was.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.560]   I mean, it is just a 24/7, your brain is broken.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.480]   It's like living in a different galaxy.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.560]   And whether or not striving and pursuing success kind of primed the pump for that, I can't
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.760]   say.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.040]   I think that there's all sorts of challenges and issues that are wrong with our striving
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   culture.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.880]   But I don't think that that was part and parcel of OCD, particularly because I kind of got
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.000]   off that hamster wheel long before I got sick.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.200]   I wasn't in a place when I got sick that I was striving for the next thing.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.320]   I was actually pretty content with how things were going.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.840]   And so yeah, it's not as tidy of a narrative to say like, "Oh, I was burning the Midnight
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.920]   Oil and I wasn't sleeping and I was just striving and chasing and therefore I got OCD."
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.320]   I think that, and I'm careful with this, I think that true significant clinical mental
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.000]   illness, while it can result from that, it often feels just like otherworldly levels
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   of different.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Well, I'm glad you got out of it.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.100]   What were some of the steps you took to get out of it and move forward?
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:56.160]   So the most important thing was finding a therapist who practices evidence-based third
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.600]   wave clinical therapies.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.800]   For me, what was most helpful was something called acceptance and commitment therapy.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.000]   And then working with that therapist for the better part of a year.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.960]   And I also took medication for the better part of a year, for more than a year.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.880]   And seeing a psychiatrist that specialized in treating obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.560]   So the tools that I learned in therapy, it's so hard to know if these medications for psychiatric
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.920]   conditions, whether or not they actually do anything, because the evidence is somewhat
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.360]   mixed and you're kind of throwing the kitchen sink at the problem, right?
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.900]   You're doing therapy, you're making sure.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.240]   So I always had pretty healthy habits.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.320]   So I'm still exercising, I'm still trying to eat well.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.940]   And yeah, when you're really sick and you're suffering, you just do anything.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.520]   And it's hard to isolate what variables actually made a difference, but I'm sure I got some
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.280]   help from the medication as well.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   Right.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.480]   I feel as a fellow author, writing is therapy as well because it forces you to be very clear
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.840]   and concise with your thoughts.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.640]   Sticking to the book, because there are a lot of terms that I really appreciated and
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.120]   I wanted to delve deeper into.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.440]   One of the terms is tragic optimism.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.080]   Can you talk about how tragic optimism can help us be happier and live less stressful
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   lives?
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.760]   It's one of my favorite parts of the book.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.980]   So I'm glad that you keyed in on this.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:27.420]   Tragic optimism was coined by Viktor Frankl, who is a Holocaust survivor and psychoanalyst.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.160]   He's most well known for his book, Man's Search for Meaning, which has sold gazillions of
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.920]   copies and is just absolute must read if you are into psychology, personal development.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.820]   He's lesser known though for this essay that he published after Man's Search for Meaning
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.420]   came out, which is called The Case for Tragic Optimism.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:53.460]   And in it, Frankl says that life is full of inevitable tragedy and suffering.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.660]   And he gives three reasons for that.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.220]   The first is that we humans are made of flesh and bone and we are going to age and we're
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.980]   going to experience illness and injury and nobody escapes life without going through
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.980]   this.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.300]   And that's a cause of pain and suffering.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.180]   The second reason is we're one of the few, if not the only species that can think ahead
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.320]   and make plans.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.540]   Some people argue that elephants and dolphins can do this, but humans are at least the most
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.580]   advanced species that can think ahead and make plans.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.780]   And because we can think ahead and make plans, occasionally, if not often, things aren't
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.540]   going to go like we thought they would.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.580]   So we're going to experience frustration and disappointment.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.820]   And then the third great tragedy of life that Frankl identified is that everything changes.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.060]   The things that we love, the people that we love, our skills, our capacities, our talents,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.820]   our youth, all of that is impermanent.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.340]   So we have these three insurmountable, inevitable tragedies that we all face.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.780]   And even though it wasn't a term then, what Frankl would say is toxic positivity or delusional
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.060]   optimism is so stupid because part and parcel of being a human is going through pain and
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.060]   suffering.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.080]   So that's where the tragedy comes from.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.560]   But what Frankl said is in spite of that or because of that or knowing that life is finite,
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.660]   we also can take that tragedy and accept it and not delude ourselves, but combine it with
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.380]   resolute, reasonable optimism, which simply means trudging forward with a positive, hopeful
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.380]   attitude nonetheless.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:27.060]   And I love this because there's such a dichotomy in modern thinking, especially on the internet,
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.300]   where there's one camp that is what I'm going to call the Pollyanna, bury your head in the
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.360]   sand, everything is great, don't worry about anything camp.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.900]   And I think that's pretty dumb and not realistic.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.660]   And then the other camp is the despair, nihilism, everything is so broken.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.220]   Let's just like despair all the time.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.740]   And I think that's a dumb approach too.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.340]   But in between that is a huge chasm.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.820]   And I think that's where tragic optimism lives, which asks you to say, yeah, like there is
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.820]   a lot that sucks.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.580]   It is hard to be a human.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.860]   There is a lot that's broken about the world.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.860]   And yet we don't have to become broken people.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.980]   And we can still find so much joy and meaning in life, even in spite of all those things.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.980]   Right.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.500]   It sounds like if we can manage our expectations to just accept that there will be tragedy,
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   that we will go through it, but we will experience better things ahead.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.280]   Can you talk about toxic positivity?
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.980]   Because I've heard this term more and more recently, and I don't quite understand what
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.980]   it means.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.980]   You know, it's definitely like a cultural term.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.300]   I'm not sure it made it into the dictionary.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.020]   So maybe I'm contributing to this mess.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:41.740]   But when I talk about toxic positivity, I simply mean it is a type of optimism or positivity
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.540]   that borders on delusional.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.860]   So it refuses to acknowledge challenges.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.340]   It suppresses negative emotions.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.500]   It only focuses on what's happening within arm's length from you and completely shuts
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.460]   down to the challenges that family members or friends or colleagues might be going through.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:07.060]   And it trudges along and says, you know, everything is absolutely fine, even though clearly that's
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.700]   not the case, because nothing is ever absolutely fine.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.420]   So I view it as like this polar opposite to despair.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.380]   And I think that neither of these emotions or neither of these mindsets are helpful,
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.940]   because they both absolve you of doing anything.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.940]   So they're cop outs.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.380]   They're freaking lazy.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:29.340]   Because if you are a toxic positivity person and everything is great, well, then you're
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.340]   never going to need to do anything to improve or to make things better.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.420]   But if you're also suffering from despair, well, then there's no reason to do anything,
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.060]   because by definition, despair is a loss of hope.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.660]   So it's so funny, because I think what you see is you see these two camps, again, like
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.540]   the Pollyanna people and the despair people.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.940]   And I actually think both of those mindsets are just lazy cop outs.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.140]   Why do you think – how does one become a Pollyanna and a toxic positivity person?
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.020]   Because I would think that if you look at the Belker, most are not that way.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.700]   Maybe these are tail end folks.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.900]   >> I think these are tail end folks, and I think that they get amplified on the internet,
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.660]   to be totally honest, because it's provocative, and that's – especially on social media,
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.660]   that's what sells.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.340]   I do think that all of these concepts have some nuance, right?
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.620]   So there's a difference between completely shutting down to the world and to other people's
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.700]   problems and to your own problems, but also not just over indexing on them and focusing
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.460]   on them all the time.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.460]   So – and there's all sorts of research that shows that this kind of tragic optimism
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.060]   is associated with better well-being and resilience.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.060]   Because it does two things at once.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:40.820]   It is optimistic and it is hopeful, but it is in a way that also acknowledges that things
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.260]   aren't always great, and that's okay, too.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.260]   >> Right.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.380]   One of the equations in your book I thought was interesting was suffering equals pain
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.180]   times resistance.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:56.900]   I feel like a lot of us resist change a lot, especially as we talk about in Master of Change
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.900]   book.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.180]   Can you talk about that equation and was this something that you discovered or how did you
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.800]   come about it?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:13.940]   >> So this equation comes out of pain science and cutting edge rehabilitation practices.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.820]   I think that change is painful for a lot of people.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:23.460]   So I took this thing that is rooted in really clinical medicine and applied it more broadly.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.320]   But I'm going to use a more clinical example to make the point really clear.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.260]   So pain equals suffering – excuse me.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.460]   Suffering equals pain times resistance.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.860]   So Sam, let's assume that you pulled your back, okay?
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.460]   And your back is really sore, your low back.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.220]   >> Yeah, I've done that before.
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.300]   >> And as a result, you have six units of pain.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.460]   >> Yep.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.540]   >> So currently, you've got suffering equals a six.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.300]   But now let's say that because you pulled your back, you start freaking out and you
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.220]   start saying, "Oh my God, I'm not going to be able to sit in this chair and record a podcast.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.100]   I might not even be able to sit in this chair ever again.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.940]   I was supposed to go out with friends this weekend and I'm not going to be able to do
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.940]   that.
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.100]   And I just took Motrin and Advil and it's not even working yet.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.620]   Oh my gosh, am I going to need to go on painkillers and then I could get addicted to painkillers
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.000]   and on and on and on."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.660]   So all of that is resisting the pain, right?
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.980]   So now let's say that your resistance is also six units.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.580]   So six times six equals 36.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.820]   So now you've got 36 units of global suffering.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.460]   >> Sounds like a lot.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.260]   >> Whereas if you just had the back pain and you just said, "This sucks.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.340]   I pulled my back.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.620]   It really hurts.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.420]   I don't know what's going to happen next, but I'm probably going to be okay.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.900]   I'm going to seek out the resources to help me.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.460]   I'm not going to catastrophize and I'm just going to let the pain be there because it's
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.420]   okay to have some pain."
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.420]   You're still suffering.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.940]   You still have six units of suffering, but six is a lot better than 36.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:59.420]   So I took that concept and I broadened it to say that when change occurs, especially
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.580]   negative changes or things that we didn't foresee that we didn't want to happen, there
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.440]   is going to be some pain associated with it.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.100]   But the more that we freak out and catastrophize and resist or pretend it's not happening or
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.480]   delude ourselves, the more that we suffer.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.660]   So much like the example of a pulled back, when an unexpected change comes up, the best
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.420]   thing that we can do is just say like, "This is what's happening right now.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.500]   I don't want it.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.080]   I don't necessarily like it.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.380]   It's not necessarily something that I'm happy about, but it is what it is and I need to
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:34.340]   accept it because only when we accept it can we start taking action to make it better."
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.340]   >> Right.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.580]   I'm glad you brought up the back pain thing because I had terrible back pain, sciatica.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.720]   I couldn't really drive for more than 10 minutes.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:48.540]   This was back in maybe 2010, 2009 and it was really bad.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.900]   TMJ as well.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.620]   Couldn't sit at my office table for more than 5 minutes.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.620]   It was bad.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.580]   And then I read a book called Healing Back Pain by Dr. Sarno and I love that book.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.700]   I think the best book ever for anybody who has chronic pain and it just talks about recognizing
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.100]   the anger and the frustration you have inside you, bringing it to the forefront, accepting
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.420]   it and telling yourself you don't need to manifest this chronic physical pain.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.500]   You already get it.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.500]   And actually yell at yourself and say, "It's okay.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.820]   Just leave me alone."
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.980]   And then three months later, my back pain went away and it's been gone for about 15
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.980]   years.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.580]   And I look back to that time in 2009, 2010.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:25.860]   I mean, what was happening then?
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.060]   Well, I was sitting on the training desk at Credit Suisse and it was the global financial
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.700]   crisis and Lehman Brothers was going bankrupt.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.460]   And there was just so much stress back then.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.140]   So there's definitely a mind-body connection.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.140]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.140]   Ryan Neuhofel: Yeah.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.700]   I think that I – I'm hesitant to say anything too definitive because it's outside of my
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.100]   area of expertise.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.740]   There's absolutely a mind-body connection.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.420]   I think pain comes in all sorts of flavors and no two people have the same experience.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.700]   I think that sometimes what we experience as physical pain is probably more psychosocial
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.700]   and it's just manifesting as physical pain.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.580]   I think other times, it's more organic and biological.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.380]   You herniate a disc in your back.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.100]   Well, that's probably what's driving it.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.020]   But even then, if you've got all kinds of other life stress or you can't accept what's
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.180]   going on, you're going to suffer more.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:24.180]   So in a way, you can think of this equation and maybe what Dr. Sarno would say is that
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.300]   the resistance is all the emotional, psychological, social stuff around the pain.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.740]   If you can just dampen that resistance and get it from six units to four units to two
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:40.700]   units to ideally one unit, then eventually the pain is going to subside.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.740]   But everyone has their own experience of chronic pain.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.100]   I will say that this is the evidence-based model that is used at the Mayo Clinic's
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.060]   Pain and Rehabilitation Center, which is probably the best in the world.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.060]   People from all over the world come there to treat chronic pain.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.860]   For the book, I got to report and explore their methods.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.500]   It's fascinating because the first thing that they do is they try to help patients
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.700]   understand that the goal isn't to get rid of their pain.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.020]   So stop trying so hard because trying to get rid of it is its own form of resistance.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.660]   It's like this Zen cone.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.460]   The goal is to get them to accept their pain.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.740]   Once they accept it, it tends to dissolve or at least get much better.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.740]   Dr. Seheult: Right.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.740]   No, that's absolutely true.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.580]   Dr. Sarno is talking about, "Well, if you go to the chiropractor and the physical therapist
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.260]   and all that, you're accepting the pain and you're kind of resisting the pain.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.660]   Just accept it."
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:39.300]   So I do believe in that and I do believe there is a really strong mental and physical connection,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.780]   at least based on my own experience.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.380]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: And I think we have to separate and then I'll say one more thing
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.580]   then we can move on because it's important for listeners.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.420]   I think we have to separate chronic pain from acute injury.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.420]   Dr. Sarno: Okay.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.420]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.420]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: So if you tear your ACL–
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.420]   Dr. Sarno: Of course.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.220]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: –and you like rupture a disc, you know, no amount of mindset is
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.460]   going to heal that.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.460]   Like you need–
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.460]   Dr. Sarno: Right.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.460]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: –surgical repair or PT.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.460]   Dr. Sarno: Right.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.740]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: But if after you tear your ACL and got the surgery or after you
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.740]   did all the PT–
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.740]   Dr. Sarno: Yeah.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.540]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: –and the MRIs and the x-rays, structurally things are "fixed"
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.140]   but then you're still experiencing a lot of pain, I think that's where some of these
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.780]   psychosocial aspects come in.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.460]   And it's not to negate the pain.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.460]   I hate this.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.460]   Like pain is all in your head.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.780]   Everything's all in your head.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.940]   That's where our brain is.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.940]   So like of course, your experience is–is derived or mediated through your brain.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.580]   So it doesn't make the pain any less real.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.660]   I think it just says that the tools we have to treat it need to change.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.380]   It can't always just be what we think of as traditional medicine.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.380]   Dr. Sarno: Right.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.260]   I hear–I hear in your voice you're pretty fired up.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.980]   Did–did this bring back memories of that injury that derailed your sports career?
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.580]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: I've had so many injuries.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.940]   I think I'm just fired up about this because I think it's this area where there's so
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.860]   much judgment, right?
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.860]   People are like, "Oh, you're in pain.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.860]   Like it's all in your head."
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.500]   What a shitty thing to say to someone that's in chronic pain.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.500]   Dr. Sarno: Sure.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.740]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: And I think that we can talk about this in a much more compassionate
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   way.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.660]   Realizing that if it was as easy as like, you know, saying, "Oh, I'm gonna accept
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.780]   this pain and have a growth mindset," then everyone would do that.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.380]   So these are like hard, nuanced topics and I think that we can be both kind to ourselves
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.940]   and to other people that are going through this at the same time as we teach these skills.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.780]   And I don't think because, you know, it doesn't show up on an x-ray, it makes the
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.780]   pain any less real.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.500]   Again, it just means that we might need to bring different tools to bear.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:35.980]   But our culture in the West is so like freak out, catastrophize, worry, try to fix everything
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.980]   right away.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:43.180]   And you know, that has its limits and that also fires me up.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:50.820]   You could argue that the opioid epidemic is in no small part born out of convincing people
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.060]   that all pain should be minimized and go away immediately and that led to a lot more suffering
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.700]   than just accepting the pain.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.700]   Dr. Sarno: Yeah.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.860]   Why do you think we've got to this stage in society?
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:11.940]   It seems like there's just this crazy amount of anxiety and strive to do better and one
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.940]   up everybody.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.940]   What's going on here?
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.980]   Matthew Fossum You know, I think that it's twofold.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:24.300]   One is I think that consumerism itself runs on an engine of people feeling like they need
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.040]   problems to fix or they need to do more to be enough.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.380]   Because if everybody felt like they were enough and everybody felt like they didn't have
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.460]   problems to fix, then they wouldn't buy stuff.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.220]   So I think some of it is just the consumer model.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.300]   And I am not a monk.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.940]   I don't practice renunciation.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.940]   I own a nice watch.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.700]   I live in a nice house.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.180]   I wear clothes.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.380]   So I'm not here to like bash consumer capitalism.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.620]   But I am here to point out that the entire system, especially like consumer products
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:01.500]   and goods, the fancy car, the fancy house, the bigger house, the gold, the diamonds,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.920]   that's really there to make you feel like you are enough.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.440]   But it's an illusion because like feeling like you're enough is an inside game.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.880]   So I think a lot of it is just it's kind of like the sea that we swim in.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:18.160]   And this has extended more recently, talk about change, into the internet where everything
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.820]   is quantifiable now.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.560]   So how many downloads does your podcast have?
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560]   Where does it rank?
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.120]   How many followers do you have on Instagram?
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.420]   How many followers do you have in Twitter?
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.840]   How many people commented on your LinkedIn post?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.400]   So it almost takes ourselves, our very personhood, and like makes us commodities on a personality
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   marketplace.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.920]   So of course, that's not a great way to attain mental health.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:45.480]   And the last thing that I'll say is we have experienced accelerating change societally.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.840]   So in America, the Overton window on our politics has shifted by a million percent in the last
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.200]   eight years.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   We've gone through a pandemic.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.520]   The emergence of the internet is still, you could argue, in the historical scheme in its
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.780]   infancy, and your artificial intelligence is knocking on the doorstep.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.960]   So we have all of these massive changes that are affecting just about everyone.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.760]   And I think that like it can feel like the ground that we're on is really shaky.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.240]   And if we don't have the skills to navigate that shaky ground, then it's easy just to
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.160]   latch on to buying something or to having something to make us feel secure.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.000]   No, I totally hear you.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.560]   It's funny you talk about bigger house because I'm thinking about getting a bigger house
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.960]   myself.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.720]   And I have a lot of doubt in my mind because I'm thinking, "Well, what if I buy the bigger
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.920]   house and I'm not happier?"
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.400]   And I kind of use tragic optimism to say, "I probably won't be happier.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.760]   I'll be happier for maybe a month or two or three months."
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.560]   But then it's like, "Eh, it's just another bigger house with more maintenance."
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.400]   That consumerism thing is really a big one.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.920]   I'm pretty frugal by nature.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.160]   That's kind of how you have to be to try to retire early or achieve financial independence.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.440]   You got to save aggressively.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.920]   So I hear you on that and it definitely sounds like social media is not a good thing for
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.600]   most people's mental health.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:13.800]   Yeah, and I have to be careful here because like social media can have very real benefits.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.000]   I think that people just overlook the cost and they aren't intentional.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.480]   I think that you could take so many of the principles from the financial independence
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.840]   movement, which I know you're one of the founding pioneers of, and apply it to just about anything
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.640]   because at the end of the day, it's really about how much intentionality are you bringing
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.280]   to your actions.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.360]   So my understanding is the financial independence movement says, it doesn't say never spend
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.360]   money, but it says be really intentional and ask yourself, "How does this fit into a broader
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.840]   plan and what are going to be the downstream effects of this and how is this going to make
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.440]   me feel two years from now?"
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.920]   I think that we should bring that kind of intentionality to how we interact on the internet,
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.520]   to the people that we surround ourselves with, to how we take care of our health because
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.800]   I think that like all of this, the biggest risk is going on autopilot because if you
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.880]   go on autopilot, you're just going to get swept up wherever society wants to take you
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:15.320]   and maybe 80 percent of the time, that's fine, but 20 percent of the time, it's not.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.120]   So mental health, there's this great highlight in your book called The Psychological Immune
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.640]   System by Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.560]   Can you talk about that because I never heard about it and it makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   All right.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.680]   So let's start with the physical immune system because that's going to be a concept that
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   everyone's heard of.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:40.360]   So our physical immune system, we get sick or we get injured and the job of our physical
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   immune system is to marshal the appropriate resources in our body to help us heal and
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.520]   to move on from that.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.760]   The more aggressive the insult, which is just science speak for saying the more we get hurt,
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.760]   the bigger the injury, the more severe the disease or the illness, the harder it is for
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.640]   our immune system and the longer it takes.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:08.480]   So to simplify even more, a small cut, if you're healthy, generally heals within a
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.040]   day or two.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.560]   A big gash in your arm could take a month to heal.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.560]   Why?
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.440]   Because the bigger gash takes your immune system more time.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.320]   The inflammatory process, the white blood cells that come and rush into the area, it
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.880]   takes more time.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:27.160]   So we don't wonder why bigger injuries take longer to heal than small injuries.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   We just know our immune system needs more time.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.120]   But we also have this psychological immune system and its job is to help us heal and
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.760]   make sense of big changes that occur in our lives.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.520]   And much like our physical immune system, the bigger the change, the longer it takes
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.760]   our psychological immune system to help us integrate it into our narrative.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.480]   So small change.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.600]   You think that you're going to record this podcast with me and your dog has diarrhea
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.240]   on the carpet and your kid has strep throat, so you have to cancel.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.560]   Kind of messes up your day.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.720]   Maybe you're frustrated for a while, but my guess is by tomorrow, you're totally fine.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.120]   Like your psychological immune system says no big deal.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.640]   Like, you know, that's a paper cut.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.240]   These things happen.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.000]   That's very different than a cancer diagnosis or a divorce or the loss of a close friend
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.560]   or a family member.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.440]   For those things, the psychological immune system takes so much more time to find meaning
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.880]   and to integrate it into our narrative.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.600]   So when we undergo these major disruptions in our life, we all want a quick fix.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.240]   We want our immune system to work really fast.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.680]   We want to find growth and meaning and move forward.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.720]   But we can't rush that process because the bigger the change, the longer it takes.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.400]   And I think this is such an important expectation to have because we can show ourselves some
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.800]   grace in the middle of all the grit that we have to bring to these big changes.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   Right.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.520]   No, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.200]   In terms of, you know, you work out a lot.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.120]   You say you're at the gym a lot.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:03.000]   And I'm assuming you're trying to maintain strength or increase strength.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.480]   So what about increasing our immune systems, our physical and psychological immune systems?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.720]   Can we do things to increase and strengthen those?
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.080]   Or it is we're born with what we have and that's it?
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   We can absolutely.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.280]   That's a question I think you probably know the answer to.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:25.180]   We can absolutely do things to increase our physical and psychological immune systems.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:32.320]   So our physical immune system, the most important things that we can do is sleep, move our bodies
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   regularly.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.120]   So it doesn't have to be super strenuous, but just engage in regular physical activity
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:42.800]   and then do what we can to eat a relatively nutritious diet, which today means avoiding
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.440]   ultra processed foods.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.080]   Those are the big three.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.600]   And I would also add eliminate tobacco products.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.320]   So if you're someone that smokes or uses a vape pen, I think it's really important to
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   try to get help quitting if you care about your health.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.120]   And then alcohol is the elephant in the room because it's such a part of culture.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.520]   And the research is pretty clear that any more than five drinks per week, alcohol starts
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.280]   to have negative effects.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.320]   Now there are trade-offs.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.640]   Some people say I'd rather drink five drinks a week because we're all going to die anyways.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.560]   So if it has a slightly negative effect, that's fine, but less is more.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.200]   Now that's the physical immune system.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.800]   The psychological immune system, to me, this is a little bit more interesting because it's
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.940]   not as clear cut.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.920]   It's harder to study.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:34.400]   Where we do have research, what it tells us is that the best things that we can do to
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:39.680]   strengthen our psychological immune system are kind of work on these two polar opposite
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.560]   ends of a spectrum or of a barbell.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.480]   So on one end, we can gain sources of ruggedness and strengthen our lives.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.200]   So we can strengthen our relationships because the people are ultimately what's going to
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.520]   hold us when we fall, when things are hard.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.680]   We can develop really good daily habits and practices that are portable, that we can take
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   with us even when things around us change.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:10.240]   So that is having some sort of anchor or stability in your life regardless of what else is happening.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.680]   And then we can also strengthen our psychological immune system by developing these tools to
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.640]   navigate change skillfully.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:22.880]   And I think the most important one that I go into great detail in the book is this skill
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.920]   of responding, not reacting.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.360]   So when a change happens, there's two roads we can go down.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.400]   We can react, which tends to be rash.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.120]   It's a very hot emotion.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.480]   It's often infused with anger or panic.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.420]   Or we can respond, which is thoughtful.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.720]   It's deliberate.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.140]   It's planful.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.160]   We use our prefrontal cortex, the more evolved parts of our brain.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.760]   And the more that we can respond to the disruptions and the changes in our lives, the more we
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.840]   develop what psychologists call self-efficacy, which is this confidence that's based on evidence
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:04.880]   that regardless of what life throws at us, we can endure and we'll be okay.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.240]   And that is ultimately the definition of a strong psychological immune system.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.720]   So it's these two rungs, right?
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.240]   It's doing what you can to build these anchors and these sources of ruggedness and stability
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.000]   in your life, particularly relationships and these portable routines on the one hand.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.560]   And then on the other hand, it's when change happens, because as I said, it comes for all
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   of us, practicing this skill of responding, not reacting.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   Right.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.120]   No, responding, not reacting.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.320]   That's a tough one because let's say you drive a car and someone cuts you off or honks at
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.200]   you or yells at you.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.840]   The instant reaction, at least for me, is to yell at them back and I don't know, mow
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   them down.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.760]   And then I have to think, "Well, I've got a family now.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   I don't want a lawsuit.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.880]   Let's just try to let it go."
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.120]   But I don't succeed all the time and it gets me and I think a lot of drivers riled up when
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.680]   something bad happens on the road.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.920]   I mean, how do we counteract that?
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.920]   It's a practice.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   It's not a switch that we can flip.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:08.000]   And I think that practicing in those smaller scale examples, driving is like a perfect
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.340]   place to practice, is really helpful.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.360]   So I think the most important part is just pausing.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.960]   So when someone cuts you off or when someone edges into your lane and you hit the horn
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:25.160]   because that's what you need to do for safety, after that, when you feel your blood boil,
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:32.680]   when you feel that visceral reactionary thing in your body, just try to use that as a cue
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:40.880]   to take four deep breaths, maybe even just two deep breaths, maybe even just one.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.440]   And then you can process what happens and you can make a plan.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.720]   And maybe your plan will be, "I'm going to mow that guy down."
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.520]   But odds are, after you've taken a deep breath and you've said, "All right, that just happened,"
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.480]   generally speaking, it's easier to calm down.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.960]   And in that particular instance, something that I found helpful, because I'm a human
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.720]   too, I'm not this Jedi master.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.560]   I also get pissed off when people cut me off.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.520]   But I try to remind myself that I don't know if that person just got served divorce papers
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.240]   or I don't know if that person is rushing to the hospital to see their child who's in
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.400]   a pediatric intensive care unit.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.560]   I have no idea what's going on in that person's life.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.080]   And I don't know if that person just missed me in their blind spot, because I don't know
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.440]   about you, but I've cut people off before completely by accident.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   Never done that.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   But so I think this is part of the practice, right?
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:37.240]   It's like taking this broader perspective, because all of these ways of zooming us out
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:44.560]   from this acute, visceral, hardwired, reactionary thing helps us to create some space to respond.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.800]   And the more that we go through this cycle, the more that we succeed in responding, the
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   easier it becomes in the future.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.080]   It's interesting with Financial Samurai since 2009.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   Do you have kids, Sam?
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   Oh, do I have kids?
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.840]   I do have two kids.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.560]   So that's another great place to practice, right?
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.680]   Because kids are constantly – and how old – are your kids young or old?
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.800]   Three and a half and six and a half.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   Perfect.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.120]   So I got kids in the same age range.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.960]   They are sometimes the best thing in the world, but they can be annoying little devils, right?
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.880]   And that is great practice.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.080]   So like how often do you probably get angry or almost maybe you're tired or you're
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.520]   hungry and like you want to snap on your kids?
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.160]   Those are the best and most important times in daily life to practice just responding,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   not reacting.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.340]   So just remembering like this is not a small adult.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.340]   This is a child.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.800]   And yes, this child is being really annoying, but they're probably doing the best that
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:40.720]   they can and me yelling or showing aversive body language is not going to help the situation.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.960]   So then when we have these massive changes in our life, when we get laid off or we put
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.760]   out a new project and it doesn't do as well as we thought or really good things happen
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.320]   to us, we hit a bestseller list, our podcast becomes ranked number one, we get a big promotion
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:58.920]   at work, we just get practice in kind of riding these waves instead of getting swallowed by
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.000]   them.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.120]   So kids and traffic are two great places to practice.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.600]   Well, I've had a lot of practice being a stay-at-home dad for six and a half years.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.920]   I've heard crying multiple times a day for six and a half years in a row every single
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.160]   day.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.840]   And that is a lot of practice and a lot of patience.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.960]   And it's part of the reason why I was thinking to myself, "I need to get a day job so I can
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.080]   take a vacation from being a father for 10 hours a day."
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:31.920]   I don't know if parents really realize who have day jobs how actually nice it is to take
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.400]   a break and recharge from family for 8 to 10 to 12 hours a day versus always being at
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.400]   home.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   It's a tough balance.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.400]   >> It is.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:47.760]   >> I have a question for you in terms of seeing the world a little differently because I was
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.320]   saying I started financial assignment in 2009 and over the course of 14 years, I've seen
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   it grow.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.960]   And as it grows, you have more opinions, good and bad.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:04.600]   And what I really enjoy is actually reading fired up comments because it means that somewhere
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.480]   the motions have been tickled.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:13.280]   And what I've found is if I start realizing that everybody has something going on in their
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.360]   head, some problem, some stress, and just the comments are just kind of like a sounding
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.280]   board or reflection, it makes me feel at peace.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.680]   I'm like, "Oh, man, I'm sorry you feel so angry."
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.160]   Do you feel this is a healthy way to look at things where you don't know what kind of
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.680]   mental issues or challenges each person has and you just kind of accept and empathize
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.200]   or do you think that's just not a healthy way to look at things?
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.960]   >> I think it depends.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.040]   I think if you're going to read the comments, then yeah, that's a really healthy way because
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.400]   like anger plus anger just equals more anger.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.000]   So I'm very similar.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.640]   I don't – where I'm different is I don't tend to engage with these people that often
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.120]   because I just find it's a time and energy suck.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:04.960]   But when I do and I'm the best version of myself, I don't go back at people.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.000]   But I sometimes will point out and I'll just say like, "I'm sorry you're so angry."
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.520]   Or like, "Why does everything make you so angry?"
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.760]   Or maybe I don't even type that.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.320]   But maybe in my head I'm like, "Man, like it would stink to be this person on social
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.880]   media who just gets so angry about everything."
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.160]   >> Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.880]   But I actually like to dig a little bit deeper because sometimes, maybe 30% of the time,
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.680]   I uncover something that's going on in their lives that's really tough and then you just
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.800]   kind of make a connection.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.720]   As a writer, it's always interesting to hear people's stories and personal stories and
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.920]   then share it if they allow me to and then maybe we can learn from that as well.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.520]   >> Yeah, I think that that's right.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.480]   It takes a lot of patience though to do on the internet.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:57.200]   I found that it's so much easier to do that in in-person forums and even over email.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:02.000]   But like on a comment section, it can just be hard because you don't know someone's situation
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.120]   but you also don't know their motivations.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.440]   And sometimes it's just to be a troll.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.700]   Sometimes it's they know that the more provocative stuff gets more attention.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:16.600]   So it's a tricky balance I think for anyone on the internet is when to engage because
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.040]   you don't want to just be in an echo chamber where you only surround yourself with people
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.640]   that think the same way.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.840]   But you also don't need to be a masochist and expose yourself to people that are like
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:32.800]   just out there to rile you up or hurt you or are struggling with their own insanity.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.860]   No, it's interesting, the journey of the internet.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.160]   So actually, tell me, why did you decide to move across country?
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.160]   Why go through all this change?
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.920]   What was going on with you?
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.480]   >> Yeah, it's a couple of reasons.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.360]   The predominant reason, so we used to live in Oakland, California.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.880]   And now we live in Asheville, North Carolina, which is a smaller mountain town in the west
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.680]   part of the state.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.680]   And the driving force was my wife's family is all on the East Coast.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   >> Oh, perfect.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.080]   >> And she's really close with her family.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.120]   And I love my wife and I want to support her.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.000]   And it felt really hard for her to be this far from family, especially when we had our
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   young kids.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.680]   >> But that was hard for me at first because I loved living in the Bay Area.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   I had a big network there.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   >> How long were you here?
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   >> 10 years.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   >> Okay.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.360]   >> I had a large network there.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.240]   As an author, it's a great place.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.240]   There's great bookstores.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.000]   It's a huge market of people.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.680]   There's a lot of other intellectual people.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   The weather is great.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.320]   I mean, do you live in the Bay Area?
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.680]   >> I live in San Francisco.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   >> Yeah, so you know, like there's a lot that's good about it.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.120]   So it was a big change and it was hard.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.760]   Now of course, my psychological immune system has kicked in.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.520]   I found meaning and growth and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else and Asheville
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.760]   squarely feels like home.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.440]   But at the time, it was challenging.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.640]   And then I think the other reason gets to our own goals of financial independence.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:02.360]   And it's just easier to attain that in a place like Asheville than in the Bay Area.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.720]   >> Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.480]   Where are your parents?
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.840]   >> My parents who I'm not very close with are in Michigan.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.480]   And my brother who I'm extremely close with is in Utah, Salt Lake, although he's moving
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   to Philadelphia.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   So he'll be a lot closer.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   >> Okay.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.760]   Yeah, I've struggled with relocating for a while now.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.920]   I've been here since 2001 after living in New York City for two years.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.120]   And I love the place.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.160]   And it's a great place if you can afford it.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.040]   But my parents are getting older and they live in Hawaii.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.200]   And the one better place than San Francisco, in my opinion, is anywhere in Hawaii.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:41.160]   So, and the funny thing is Hawaii is actually about 25% cheaper than San Francisco, anywhere
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.360]   in Hawaii.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.520]   So that's good that you made a move.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:50.060]   How long did it take for you to say, "Okay, I'm willing to move to Asheville from Oakland"?
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.400]   >> That was a process that took, I don't know, three years.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   >> Three years.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   Wow.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.040]   >> Well, in multiple conversations, you know, the most important conversations today in
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.480]   our marriage, to be honest, about like, what's it going to take for us to be happy?
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.160]   How do we find a solution that is best for us?
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.560]   Not for me or you, but what's best for us?
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.240]   Where are the various places that we think we could be happy?
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.520]   Let's go visit these places.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.040]   Let's also like really try to envision what it would look like to buy a house outside
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.880]   of Oakland or in Berkeley.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.680]   And like, let's go look at houses and let's see how that feels.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   And let's really be methodical.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:29.400]   >> And ultimately, we reached a point where just like, the path to living in Oakland was
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:35.480]   one or in the Bay Area more broadly, I should say, was one that particularly my wife just
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.400]   like could not get excited about.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.520]   And I always loved mountain towns.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.920]   So like, you know, even the biggest decisions in marriages are sometimes like, you know,
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   quasi negotiations to get to what's best for us.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.960]   So I remember saying like, "I don't think I really want to move to D.C. where your family
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.120]   is because that's just a big East Coast city."
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.320]   But man, there are some great small mountain towns in the mid-Atlantic and I bet we could
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.080]   both get really excited about one of those.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.080]   >> Right.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:07.120]   >> So we did a little tour of these mountain towns and we fell in love with Asheville and
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.560]   now I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.960]   I really couldn't.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:16.520]   >> What's the median home price in Berkeley nowadays versus Asheville?
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:27.520]   >> So without getting into too granular of details, I can broadly say that you can triple
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:35.440]   to quadruple the price of a house in the Oakland Hills versus Asheville.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.660]   So a $1 million home in Asheville is going to get you one of the nicest homes in Asheville.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.280]   That would be about $4 million.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.080]   A $500,000 home in Asheville is probably looking like a $2 million home in the Bay Area.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.720]   >> Although we haven't done this, we haven't played this game in four years so I'm sure
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.240]   it's changed because we moved, we made this decision prior to the pandemic so it wasn't
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.320]   a pandemic move.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.160]   So I'm sure these numbers have changed.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.960]   No, it's definitely the geo-arbitrage folks.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:07.160]   I mean, one of the things I talk about a lot is move to a place that you can better afford
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   and have a better lifestyle.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.560]   You don't have to stay stuck anymore thanks to the internet.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.320]   And Asheville has its quirks.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.440]   So like there's no big airport.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.840]   It's two hours from the biggest airport.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.840]   I mean, it's a much smaller town.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:24.480]   And for us, it made a lot of sense but I think when I talk to people about this, I think
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   there are a lot of like middle grounds, you know, where it's not such a drastic change
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.840]   from a place like the Bay Area or New York City but it still affords people a lot more
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.840]   autonomy.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:38.440]   >> Actually, one of the things, do you know what the demographic, the racial makeup is
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   of Asheville?
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:44.280]   >> I don't know off the top of my head but I can promise you it's not nearly as diverse
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   as the Bay Area.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.840]   >> And that's something that we miss.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:53.200]   >> One of the blind spots that I have, that other people have is that, oh, just move anywhere
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.160]   that's lower cost and you'll save a lot of money and you'll get to financial independence
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   sooner.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.780]   But you might not be comfortable living in a place where nobody looks like you, right,
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.780]   for example.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.640]   And it might be easier for other people to go to a place where everybody looks like them,
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   right?
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   So it's something to consider as well.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.120]   >> I think that's really important and that is probably the thing that we miss most.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.600]   You know, in Oakland I'd go into a coffee shop and as a white guy I'd be like the minority
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.240]   and here I'm the majority.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.720]   And that is something that I don't know if I'll ever get fully used to but when we first
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.640]   moved here it was definitely a bit of a shock.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.160]   >> Right, right, right.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.820]   So try before you buy, folks.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.820]   Go visit it.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.120]   Maybe take a two, three week vacation.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   >> Oh, you have to.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.400]   >> And it's not going to be like, you know, manic sight unseen.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:44.240]   I mean, where you live has such a profound impact on who you are.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.240]   Gets back to the book, right?
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:51.560]   There's this section in the book on identity and how we think of ourselves as our Myers-Briggs
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:56.040]   score or our Enneagram number and we think of ourselves in the confine of our skin and
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:02.000]   skull but ourselves are actually completely wholly shaped by our environment.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   So where you live is going to have a huge impact on who you become.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.720]   So if you want to guide your own personal evolution and you want to do what you can
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:17.320]   to guide the way that you, your identity changes over time, it's so important to consider things
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:22.920]   like where you live and what kind of person you'll become living there, who you surround
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:28.400]   yourself with, what kind of job you do, who you keep as really close friends and like
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.720]   what does that mean for who you'll become.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.600]   Because it's a very Western thing to just think of our identity as just independent
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:42.120]   and I can exert control and it doesn't matter if I live in Asheville or New York or Oakland.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.800]   Like I'm me.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:49.080]   And all sorts of research shows that's just like patently an erroneous view.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.560]   >> Right.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:59.360]   In terms of I guess success and money or – well, this is a personal finance podcast or thematic
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.000]   podcast or at least site.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.520]   What does success mean to you and how much is enough for you as the author, the coach,
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.020]   the father?
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:15.400]   >> So I define success as knowing my core values and the things that I really value
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:21.600]   in life and being able to live in alignment with those.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.560]   And one of those things is autonomy.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:28.880]   So being able to spend time and energy on the people and things that mean the most to
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.600]   me, that is my definition of success.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:38.200]   And the truth is if we stayed in the Bay Area, I'd have less autonomy than I do now.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.080]   I probably would still be doing all sorts of contract work with large corporations just
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.400]   to be able to afford to live there.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.520]   So that value definitely drove some of this.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.840]   But I really think it just comes down to like being able to spend your time and energy on
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.960]   the things that matter to you and not necessarily being like utopian about it.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.040]   I think part of being a mature adult is realizing that there's always going to be some stuff
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.560]   that you don't like to do that you have to do.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.560]   Like if you own a cat, you got to scoop the litter and I think that's a really important
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.440]   metaphor for life.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.400]   But you don't have to create more complexity if it's not needed.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.840]   That's a good perspective.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.680]   And it really hammers home the point.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   I wonder how much of living in big cities like San Francisco, New York, LA really grinds
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.040]   people down because of the cost of living.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.780]   But it's not just the cost of living.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.880]   It's surrounding yourself with super motivated successful people that you see constantly
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.560]   and that remind you, "Oh, maybe you got to be doing more, trying harder."
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.420]   >> But it's the double-edged sword, right?
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:46.200]   Because like there's such an intellectual energy that comes from those places too.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.440]   And I think that there's a lot of nuance here.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.600]   So I'm not arguing for people to live any particular place.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.120]   I think like you said, it takes a lot of knowing yourself and if you're in a family, knowing
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   what's best for your family and experimenting.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.760]   But I do think that there's a lot of energy and that's the benefit.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.560]   But as you said, like the cost is there's a massive keeping up with the Joneses.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.560]   I'm close friends.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.920]   One of my mentors is a prominent venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:20.200]   And he does very well financially and he jokes that like he hates Halloween because all his
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.920]   neighbors are handing out like iPads and iPhones.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.040]   And that's a joke but I think that there's some truth to that.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   >> Sure.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.840]   How much stress, okay, what would you rate your stress out of 10, 10 being the highest
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:41.680]   when you're in Oakland versus now in Asheville if you could kind of solve for the variables?
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.800]   >> If I'm being totally honest, the biggest source of distress is I knew that my wife
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.200]   wasn't happy there.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   So now she's happy.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.120]   She's far from her kids and now she's happy.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.680]   So my stress level was very high because like she's the most important person in my life
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.520]   and to see her unhappy and then to get into a dynamic that most people don't talk about,
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.960]   but I think happens often in marriages to young people where you're deciding where to
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:10.680]   live is I didn't want her to resent me for being happy in the Bay Area.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   But she didn't want me to resent her for moving.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.840]   So we kind of got into like this double bind where at the heart of it, we're really just
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.480]   caring about each other.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.320]   And that caused a lot of stress.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   And it took some time and maturity to really unpack that.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.560]   And then once it was unpacked for me to say like, if we move, I'm going to be sad because
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:33.520]   I'm going to leave my best friend in the world who's like a brother to me, who's an emergency
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.520]   medicine doctor.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.160]   He works for Kaiser Permanente, a big health system in Oakland.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.160]   So he's not moving.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.520]   I'm going to leave him, I'm going to leave the coffee shop that I wrote three books at.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.240]   I'm going to leave all my other good friends.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.320]   So I'm not going to be happy.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.280]   I'm going to be sad, but I'm not going to resent you.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:52.040]   Like I want to do this because I want to do this for us.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.160]   And it doesn't mean I'm going to move to DC and live in a suburb right next to your sister.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.840]   Let's find a place that I can get excited about that's closer to DC.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.280]   And that was really like the process that led us to move where we did.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.320]   And in this worst case, you tried for one, two years, you can always move back and say,
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.320]   Hey, you tried.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.320]   That's right.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.960]   And we also kept that open.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.400]   But it's funny because now that we're here, you know, I joke like my wife would not want
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.780]   to live in DC.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:24.160]   And I probably if I, if someone offered me to move back with Caitlin being stoked about
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.320]   it, I'd still say no, I'd be like, nah, we should stay in Asheville.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.600]   But our minds are interesting.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.080]   So like how much of that is just the psychological immune system, you know, doing its thing versus
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.720]   now I've built a life here versus it really is better.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.480]   And it's probably some combination of all those things.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.480]   Right.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.480]   Now it's life's a great adventure full of compromises, twist turns and unknowns.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:51.680]   Well, Brad, it's been great chatting with you and congrats on your book, Master of Change.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   Can you tell listeners where they can buy a copy of your book?
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   Thank you.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.160]   It was really nice chatting with you too.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.600]   The book is available pretty much everywhere.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:07.480]   So you can definitely get it on the Internet, Amazon, Barnes and Noble.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.960]   If your independent bookstore is something that you want to support, that's great.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.160]   They should all have it.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.600]   It's in audio, Kindle and of course hardcover.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.280]   And if you dug this conversation, I think you'll love the book.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.240]   So I encourage folks to pick up a copy and check it out.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   Great.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.080]   And if people want to check out what you're doing, I know you have a podcast as well and
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   you have a website.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.920]   Where can they find you?
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   That's right.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:34.240]   My podcast is called The Growth Equation Podcast and my website is just my name, www.bradstahlberg.com.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   Great.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   All right.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   Thanks so much, Brad.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   Thank you, Sam.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.240]   This was a pleasure.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   All right.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   Take care.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.920]   pleasure. Alright, take care.
