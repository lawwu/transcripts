[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   What are the principles, like first principles
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.880]   of just building a more energy efficient home
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.520]   and why that's important?
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.360]   - The first place you start is creating an airtight house.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.760]   You want a house to be as airtight
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.620]   and well insulated as you can.
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.380]   If you don't have a well airtight house,
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.200]   it doesn't matter what kind of tech you put into it,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.620]   what kind of solar panels you put on it,
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.860]   if it can't hold onto its heat energy
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.000]   or keep heat out efficiently,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.120]   your energy use is gonna go through the roof.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.520]   So you have to make sure that you're building it right
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.880]   to make sure that it meets certain standards.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.480]   And one of those is a passive house.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.720]   There's a passive house standard
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.800]   that is very popular around the world.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.160]   It's gaining ground.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.960]   I did not build my house to passive house certification,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.680]   but I took a lot of the underlying principles into mind
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.760]   when putting this house together.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.800]   And I worked with a company
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.040]   that was able to meet close to passive house level,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.120]   airtightness, insulation values,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.040]   to make sure that every watt of energy I spend
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.840]   to heat this house stays in the house as long as it can.
