[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.520]   - Local college students return to class in a few days.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.320]   And as the fall semester begins,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.360]   we have an email from an incoming freshman named Sharon.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.100]   "Dear Pastor John, I graduated from high school this summer
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.040]   "and I will be moving across the country
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.700]   "to attend college this fall.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.500]   "It troubles me because I've seen many kids
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.800]   "who stopped going to church
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.780]   "and gave up their relationship with God
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.880]   "after they moved out and moved onto campus.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.160]   "Do you have any advice for me on how to stay close to God
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.240]   "despite all the distractions and temptations
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.440]   "that come with campus life?
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.580]   "How do I continue to grow spiritually?
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.020]   "And how do I balance time for school and time with God?
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.540]   "Thank you, Pastor John, for any advice you would have
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.120]   "for me and for other incoming freshmen this fall."
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.260]   - This is such a good question.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.020]   I wish every high school graduate
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.340]   who's heading off to college or university
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.540]   would be thinking this way and asking this question.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.380]   So let me say a word to Sharon and to all of them
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.940]   in the hope of being of some service
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.000]   to this generation of younger Christians
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.580]   who are heading off to school.
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.740]   And I'll limit myself to five words of counsel,
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.660]   which of course will leave many specifics unanswered.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.340]   But I think these five have the effect
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.080]   of enabling students, if they buy them,
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.700]   to answer the other specifics as they arise.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.820]   So here we go.
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.580]   First, recognize, students,
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.580]   that maintaining a Christian faith is war.
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.740]   1 Timothy 6, 12, "Fight the good fight of faith, Timothy.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.460]   "Take hold on eternal life."
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.460]   Ephesians 6, 11, "Put on the whole armor of God
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.040]   "that you may be able to stand
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.660]   "against the schemes of the devil."
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.600]   1 Peter 5, 8, "Be sober-minded, be watchful.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.700]   "Your adversary, the devil, prowls around
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.380]   "like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour."
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.940]   On campus and everywhere else.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.060]   James 4, 8, "Submit yourself to God.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.480]   "Resist the devil, he will flee from you.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.700]   "Draw near to God and he will draw near to you."
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.500]   So let me put a particular twist now on this exhortation,
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.700]   namely that recognize that maintaining
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.340]   a Christian faith is war.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.060]   Here's the twist.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.960]   Sooner or later, somebody who's a little too smart
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   for their gospel britches is going to belittle your habit
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.160]   of meeting with God every day in the word and prayer,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.360]   and they're going to say something like,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   do you still think that you have to be that legalistic?
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.900]   You think you have to have a quiet time
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.420]   and a personal devotions?
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.760]   Don't you know?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.480]   Haven't you grown up?
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.260]   Don't you know that your relationship with Jesus
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.140]   should be more free, more natural, more spontaneous?
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.180]   So here's the twist I want you to put on your answer
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.360]   to that immature objection.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.600]   You say something like this.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.540]   "Well, I don't know about you,
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.940]   "but I know that I am in a war
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.580]   "with the highest possible stakes
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.780]   "because of what the Supreme Commander says to me
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.220]   "in his manual, the Bible.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.160]   "So I don't think mainly in terms of legal requirements
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.920]   "or pious platitudes like quiet time and devotions.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.440]   "I think about keeping my guns clean
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.280]   "and making sure my ammunition is ready
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.420]   "and reviewing the battle plans
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.120]   "and making sure I know the enemy and his deceptions
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.200]   "and restoring my zeal for the glorious cause
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.360]   "like George Washington caused the revolution.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.680]   "If that's glorious cause, what is this?
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.700]   "This is what the Lord has enlisted me for.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.840]   "So whatever you're talking about, I know what I'm doing.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.240]   "So join me if you want every morning, but I'm going there."
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.160]   So that's exhortation number one as you head off to college.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.760]   The Christian life is war, no matter where it's lived.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.160]   And Christians who try to pretend like it's not
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.660]   are almost certainly gonna be captured by the enemy.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.400]   Second exhortation, when you look at the armor
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.980]   that Paul describes in Ephesians 6
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.680]   that every Christian is supposed to put on
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.520]   on campus or anywhere else,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.200]   it's amazing that among the six pieces of armor,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   four of them are related to the word of God.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.680]   Most obviously, the sword is called the word of God.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.080]   Second most obvious is the belt.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.560]   It's the belt of truth.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.120]   Third most obvious is the shoes.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   They're shoes of the gospel,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.240]   readiness to run with the gospel.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.200]   And fourth, not as obvious,
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.080]   but plain when you think about it, the shield of faith.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.520]   Faith in what?
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.600]   Like faith in God when he talks to you,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.120]   when he speaks in his word, we're gonna trust.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.360]   Faith doesn't exist in a vacuum.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.840]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.600]   So faith in the word of God.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.680]   And of course, the other two, salvation,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.900]   helmet of salvation, breastplate of righteousness,
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.920]   those salvation and righteousness
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.080]   are all rooted in the gospel, which is the word.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.360]   So my second exhortation is
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.280]   make the word of God a priority in your life.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.040]   Read it every day, meditate on it every day and night.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.880]   Memorize key portions of it
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.800]   that are relevant to your situation
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.920]   and carry them with you all day long.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.800]   Now, here's another twist I wanna put on this,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.520]   a special aspect of this exhortation.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.080]   Just as college life will lead you
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.520]   into increased depths and complexities
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.280]   of cultural and personal and intellectual life,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   similarly, increase your grasp of the depths
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.080]   and the complexities of the glories of scripture.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.920]   Don't stay at a high school level.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.960]   Don't stay at a Sunday school level or homeschool level.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.600]   Some of you may have gone very, very deep in homeschool,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.560]   but don't stay anywhere.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.800]   The Bible says grow in grace.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.440]   Now, what that means particularly is this,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.200]   as you spend time in the word,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   also find new challenging authors.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.520]   You're gonna be introduced to all kinds of secular,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.800]   global, relevant authors,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.200]   to all kinds of issues in your classes.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.360]   Do the same for your faith.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.160]   Find out who J.I. Packer is and read "Knowing God."
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.800]   Find out who Wayne Grudem is
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.640]   and read his "Systematic Theology."
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.320]   Yes, even if you're not a theologian,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.520]   this book is designed for every Christian.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.360]   Find out who R.C. Sproul is and read "The Holiness of God."
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.480]   Find out the classics like John Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress."
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.600]   So the point is make the word of God,
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.520]   the substance of all the armor in this warfare,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.440]   both the offensive and the defensive,
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.160]   make it a priority in time, a priority in focus,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.360]   a priority in maturation,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.040]   deeper and deeper into the depths
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.920]   and the complexities of scripture.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.120]   So that's number two.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   Number three, never, never, never leave the local church.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:10.000]   The university is an institution created by man.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.280]   The local church is an institution created by God.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.920]   If you prioritize allegiance to university
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.120]   over allegiance to church,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.560]   you are prioritizing man over God.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.480]   This by no means implies that Christians
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   will work less hard at learning in the university
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.920]   less hard than non-Christians do.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.760]   No way.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.440]   You're gonna give yourself with all your might
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.920]   to learn as much as you can in every class.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.560]   It simply means that the church
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.000]   will remain central to the rhythm of your life.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.440]   God has designed corporate worship
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.960]   and the preaching of his word
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.720]   and fellowship of his people
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.360]   to be an essential part of maintaining
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.760]   a military discipline in your life
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.240]   with joy and triumph for the next 60 years.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.400]   Think of it that way.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.840]   You are forming military habits of mind
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.800]   for the next battles you will fight 30 years from now.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.680]   Gathering with your comrades every week in corporate worship
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.040]   under the word of God is essential
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.040]   for being ready to follow the commander into victory
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.920]   when you are at your peak at 50 years of age.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.880]   That's what's at stake right now.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.800]   You think you're gonna take a break from church
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.360]   and be powerful at 50?
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   You're dreaming.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.640]   Soldiers don't function that way.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.200]   Number four, as an overflow from your experience
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.080]   with God's people in church,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   be sure you have a handful of Christian comrades in arms
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.000]   who are speaking into your life
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.480]   and listening to your heart day in and day out.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.080]   Hebrews 3:12, so important.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.040]   "Take care, brothers, sisters, take care,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.460]   "lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.760]   "leading you to fall away from the living God.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.940]   "Exhort one another."
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.040]   How's that gonna happen now?
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   You gotta obey this.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   "Exhort one another every day as long as it is called today
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.740]   "that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.880]   "God has designed human beings
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.980]   "so that no battle is to be fought alone."
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.040]   None.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.320]   Jesus never sent anyone out
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.480]   on a solo reconnaissance mission, never.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.200]   They were always two by two
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.020]   and Paul's missionary adventures were always in teams.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.020]   We're not designed to meet the enemy alone.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.980]   The challenges of college are meant to be encountered
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.660]   arm in arm with fellow combatants.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:55.560]   Number five, finally, live a life of prayer.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.520]   Prayer.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.320]   That is, turn everything you read in scripture,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.460]   turn everything you hear in corporate worship,
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.200]   turn everything that is spoken into your life
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.300]   by your comrades, turn it all into prayer.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.680]   That is, plead with God,
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.960]   plead with God to work in you
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.640]   what you have seen in his word
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.480]   or heard from others from his word.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   Never presume that you can do anything on your own.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   Ask for God's help 10 times a day.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.560]   Be weak in the presence of God
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.400]   so that you can be strong in the presence of man.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   Make the Lord's prayer the outline of your daily cry.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.800]   Cry out that God would make his name holy
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.680]   and revered and cherished and treasured
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.920]   above all things in your life
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.760]   and through your life in the lives of others.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.920]   Plead with him to enable you to do his will,
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.480]   the way the angels do it in heaven.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.320]   Plead with him to lead you out of temptation
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.240]   and into paths of righteousness as you extend his kingdom
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.800]   and plead for the protection against the evil one,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.560]   the enemy, and all his schemes.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.060]   And yes, ask for your daily bread.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.900]   Why?
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.720]   Just so that you can get on with the battle.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.080]   It's a glorious life in front of you.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.120]   You have a great commander.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.700]   Those are my five exhortations as you head off to school.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.260]   So much more can be said, but I really believe,
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.260]   I really believe if you make these five things a priority,
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.880]   God will guide you to all the help you need
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.200]   in all the things that I haven't addressed.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.080]   - Yeah, so good.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.240]   And thank you for the question, Sharon.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.880]   As so many fruitful APJ questions have asked the question
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.560]   of how to flourish on a college campus,
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.080]   because those are really critical years.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.360]   And so it's important that we think about
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.680]   how to not waste them.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.460]   Well, we publish three times a week
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.060]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.220]   and search our episode archive.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.220]   Even reach us by email with a question you may be facing
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.220]   during a particular season of your life.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.500]   You can do all of that through our online home
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.180]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.580]   Well, the church certainly has enemies
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.920]   and the church has threats.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.140]   But who poses the greater threat?
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.900]   The modern Pharisee who is religious
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.900]   or the secular atheist who isn't?
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.340]   Hmm, that's the question next when we return on Friday.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.980]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:49.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
