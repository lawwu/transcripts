[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.460]   I will exalt you, O Yahweh, for you have lifted me up and have not let my enemies be glad
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:39.680]   over me. O Yahweh my God, I cried to you for help and you healed me. O Yahweh, you have
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.340]   brought up my soul from Sheol. You have kept me alive that I would not go down to the pit.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.220]   Sing praise to Yahweh, you his holy ones, and give thanks for the remembrance of his
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:03.940]   holy name, for his anger is but for a moment, his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may last
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:12.580]   for the night, but a shout of joy comes in the morning. As for me, I said in my prosperity,
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:21.220]   I will never be shaken. O Yahweh, by your favor you have made my mountain to stand strong.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.260]   You hid your face, I was dismayed. To you, O Yahweh, I called, and to the Lord I made
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.580]   supplication. What profit is there in my blood if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:47.500]   you? Will it declare your truth? Hear, O Yahweh, and be gracious to me. O Yahweh, be my helper.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.020]   You have turned for me my mourning into dancing. You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.800]   with gladness that my glory may sing praise to you and not be silent. O Yahweh, my God,
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.300]   I will give thanks to you forever.
