[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   I never thought about this until just this moment, but there's such a stark difference
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.560]   between asking someone like, "Where's the best ex?" versus "What do you think the best ex is?"
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.240]   And it seems like a strategy, maybe anywhere in the world, but especially in France,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.480]   might be to make all of your conversations very personal to the person you're talking to.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.760]   You nailed it. That is exactly what it is. I mean, the French want to feel like
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.400]   you're inquiring them because it's them, and not just that they happen to be a body that
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.600]   lives in proximity to some other stuff. I think that's an accurate way of
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.160]   assessing what they appreciate. Just like they don't expect you to be fluent,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.000]   you don't need to get bent out of shape that you can't have a full-on conversation with them,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.040]   but they do really appreciate you trying, whether it's with just the sort of salutations or
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.920]   asking, "Where's the bathroom?" Just try.
