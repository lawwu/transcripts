[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   and on today's podcast, I'm gonna round out my series
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.300]   on why I left the USA.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.880]   I've shared with you some of the reasons
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.240]   that many people leave that weren't my reasons.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.880]   I shared with you that it's fun to go and have an adventure
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.860]   and face challenges around the world.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.860]   Number two, I shared with you some of the things
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.960]   that I wanted to protect my children from,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.220]   and in today's podcast, I'm gonna share with you
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.600]   my most important reason for me personally,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   and also share with you my thinking or my reasoning on it.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.800]   I think you'll find it interesting
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.640]   if you are one who thinks about things
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.440]   like living with integrity, et cetera,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.680]   and if you're one of those people
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.980]   who enjoys a little bit of philosophy
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.920]   and just basically considering how you can live
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.920]   a life of integrity in a world full of difficult situations.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.780]   Quite simply, the reason that I left,
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.260]   or a reason that I left,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.280]   a very important reason that I left,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   was to be able to not owe the US government taxes.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.900]   Now, that's not a surprise
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.740]   in the internationalization space.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.100]   The world of expats is full of people
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.040]   wanting to go from here to there to save taxes.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.900]   What might be surprising to you
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.360]   is how my own reasoning differs from a lot of people,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360]   because I wasn't just trying to put money in my pocket.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   I quickly acknowledge that putting money in your pocket
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.640]   is a benefit, and if that's a reason
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.200]   that you wanna do it, go for it.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080]   It's a very valid reason.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.680]   But I'll comment at the end of,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.120]   or in the latter part of this podcast,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.160]   on why I don't think that's such a great idea.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.760]   I don't think going abroad just to save taxes
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.520]   is a smart move, especially not for wealthy people
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760]   who actually owe taxes.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.800]   What I wanna share with you, though, is my own path,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.620]   which was much more a matter of avoiding onerous taxes
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.060]   or avoiding morally evil taxes.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.480]   All taxes are not created equal.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.400]   The actual impact to your budget may be the same.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.860]   If you pay 40% taxes here or 40% taxes there,
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.380]   then the impact to your budget may be the same.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.180]   But all taxes are not morally equivalent.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.960]   Say, for example, that you live in a country
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.860]   that has government-provided healthcare.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.300]   You live in a country that provides
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.040]   all kind of welfare services for poor people.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.180]   You live in a country that has huge amounts
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.600]   of government infrastructure,
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.540]   has government colleges and universities
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.540]   that citizens can attend without cost,
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.320]   has government transit that's free
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.700]   for all the citizens to use.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.300]   Just the list goes on in terms of the things
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.660]   that you can spend money on.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.820]   If you live in a welfare state like that,
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.420]   you will often have a very high tax rate.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.980]   But while certainly that takes a lot of money
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.900]   out of your pocket, it's hard to be too upset
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.620]   at those particular things.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.020]   You can make an argument, as I would sometimes make,
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.820]   that maybe welfare is not great for people
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.460]   or maybe welfare doesn't discriminate enough,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.460]   and as it is, you might cause problems
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.620]   in people's lives, et cetera.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.820]   But at the end of the day, if you see a poor person
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.280]   and that poor person is getting free food,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.580]   or you see a person who is sick
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.780]   and that sick person is getting free healthcare,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.600]   who gets upset about that?
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.740]   Nobody gets upset about that.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.300]   You're grateful that it exists.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.220]   And if you're the one who's making money
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.980]   and paying for those things,
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.500]   there's a long stretch of time in which
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.640]   you're probably gonna feel quite happy about that.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.820]   You might grumble a little bit,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.300]   you might feel like they take too much,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.220]   you might feel like they're a little bit wasteful,
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.340]   but there's lots of people in welfare-based societies
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.320]   all around the world that pay high tax rates
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.200]   and they figure, hey, it's my duty,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.220]   it's my way of supporting the common wheel.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.540]   And while some of those people might eventually
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.840]   change their situation in order to lower taxes,
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.460]   or they'll certainly exploit anything they can do
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.700]   to reduce their legal tax rate,
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.260]   they're not often getting upset
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.440]   about what their tax money is used for,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.480]   because it makes you feel good to contribute
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.600]   to the lives of your neighbor.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.360]   But there are other things that governments spend money on
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   that don't have those same characteristics.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.980]   And there are a couple of these things specifically
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.880]   that have been very bothersome to me.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.940]   The first one over the years
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.240]   is simply military spending or war spending.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.840]   It's probably no surprise to any listener
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.640]   of radical personal finance that I struggle
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   with the morality and ethics of the amount of money
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.240]   that my government spends on military spending,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.160]   on war, et cetera.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.520]   After all, probably in the first 15 episodes of the show,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.920]   something like that, I interviewed a tax protester
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.800]   who doesn't pay taxes because of war taxes,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.640]   and he maintains a website devoted to it.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.280]   So reading about that stuff is certainly nothing new to me
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.580]   in thinking about it.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.440]   But war taxes themselves specifically,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.600]   or my frustration with them,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.320]   have never been enough to push me over the edge personally.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.360]   And that's because of the fact
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.480]   that there's always two sides to a story,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.680]   or there's always at least one counter argument.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.000]   So you could make the argument,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.760]   well, the amount of money that the United States spends
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.140]   on war and defense and military spending and whatnot
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.080]   is egregiously high, and the country is evil
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.480]   and does evil things.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.440]   But you can flip that around, and you can look
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.240]   and appreciate many good things that are done with it,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.000]   and huge amounts of peace and prosperity
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.480]   that have been wrought by the military industrial complex
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.320]   in the United States.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.760]   In almost any war, you can look at it,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.700]   and you can find good things and bad things
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.000]   that are done on both sides.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.080]   And so choosing who to support
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.100]   and making ethical decisions in light of that
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.300]   is famously difficult if you're serious about it,
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.060]   and if you're serious about listening to people.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.380]   A lot of times your opinion on a matter
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.460]   is shaped simply by how much information you have on it.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.020]   And so those who are the most in the know
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.260]   and have the most responsibility for making decisions
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.500]   often have the most information,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.020]   and they're doing their best.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.220]   The more I go through life, I just believe
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.740]   that many people are doing the best
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.260]   that they feel that they can.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.520]   And they're trying to make good decisions
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.280]   with the information that they have.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.400]   And so whenever I've listened to just strident
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.800]   anti-war activists and whatnot,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.160]   either, they just, they often sound hollow
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.440]   and uninformed and kind of delusional
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.880]   in certain circumstances.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.560]   So while I'm sympathetic to that,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.280]   that's never been enough of an issue for me
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.540]   to be all that concerned with.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.280]   However, there is another moral issue
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.720]   that came to the forefront of my thinking,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   especially in about the year 2015 and 2016.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:40.040]   And this particular issue is unique
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.840]   because it involves a crime
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   in which there is always a completely innocent party.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.280]   And what's worse is that in this crime,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.860]   it is always the innocent party who is hurt.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.520]   In many crimes, in many moral issues,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.160]   in many issues of immorality and evil,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.680]   when you look to assign blame,
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.120]   it's very rare that if you have two parties involved,
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.240]   you could say that 100% of the blame is on one person
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.560]   and 0% is on the other person.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.120]   Maybe there are those situations,
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.300]   but a lot of times, even in the clearest examples,
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.920]   you might, a guy goes down the street,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.160]   sees a little old lady with a nice purse
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.700]   and sticks out a knife and steals her purse.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.600]   Well, certainly, you're not gonna assign
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   the little old lady any moral guilt in that,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.840]   but you might say to yourself,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.120]   well, should she really have had her nice purse that day?
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.000]   And so you might say, well, it's 99.9% the bad guy
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.100]   and 0.01%, she could have just gone out with her wallet.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.960]   Or she could have ridden the bus that day.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.200]   And I'm trying to use an example that you'll understand
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   that most crimes, even when they get close to 100%,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.320]   there's not somebody who's actually
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.960]   completely innocent in it.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.160]   And most are far clearer, I mean, excuse me,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.680]   far more unclear than the little old lady
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.840]   and the purse snatcher.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.760]   But what is that crime in which the innocent person
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.360]   always pays the price and the guilty person
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.220]   always gets off scot-free?
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.760]   That crime is abortion.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:35.620]   When a baby is aborted, the baby is 100% of the time,
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.460]   the innocent party.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.580]   And yet 100% of the time, the baby is the one who pays
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.460]   with his or her life.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.940]   The baby is the one who winds up dead.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.480]   It doesn't matter the circumstances of conception.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.080]   It doesn't matter if the baby was conceived
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.520]   by loving parents who were excited for his or her arrival.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.460]   It doesn't matter if the baby was conceived
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.040]   in violent rape or horrific crime of some kind.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.400]   The baby is always the innocent party.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.820]   And it doesn't matter the reason for the abortion.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.360]   The baby gets killed because she happens to be a girl.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.120]   But what did the baby have to do with that?
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.320]   The baby is 100% of the time innocent,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.280]   completely and utterly innocent.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.040]   And yet the baby always dies.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.240]   Sometimes other people pay the price.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.420]   Sometimes a violent rapist gets put into prison,
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.300]   judged in front of court, et cetera.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.000]   Sometimes the mother pays the price.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.320]   At the very least, she bears the scars of what she has done
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.800]   for the duration of her life, et cetera.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.760]   But at the end of the day,
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.920]   the baby always pays the ultimate price.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.360]   So what does this have to do with taxes?
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.360]   Well, in 2015, there was a presidential election.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.120]   And in that presidential election,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.960]   the front runners of that election were, at the time,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.320]   Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.120]   two former senators of the,
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.200]   or two senators of the United States.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.120]   And both of them were running for president.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.600]   And in that election, both of them pledged
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.060]   that if elected president,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:21.520]   I will abolish the Hyde Amendment.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.640]   And the Hyde Amendment is a piece of legislation
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.960]   that gets passed regularly in the United States
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.560]   that ostensibly bars the use of US taxpayer dollars
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.600]   to pay for abortion.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   And that's something that was put in as a compromise
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.720]   to try to keep people who didn't want to pay for abortion,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.080]   keep them paying their taxes
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.840]   and not rise up in a tax revolt or something like that.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.800]   And yet both of them vowed that they would abolish that.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   So in 2016, I was sitting there as a young man, father,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.920]   thinking about these issues.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.240]   And I'm asking myself this question,
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.540]   like how do I, if Hillary Clinton wins,
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.040]   as I expected her to do, if Hillary Clinton wins,
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   how do I write a check to the US government
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.900]   to pay my taxes?
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.740]   How do I do that?
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.840]   How do I look myself in the mirror
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   and know that not only do I face some form of moral guilt
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.600]   for knowing what my neighbor is doing
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.160]   and not necessarily knowing how to stop it,
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.300]   knowing that babies are being murdered around me
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.420]   and I can't do anything about it,
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.520]   but now the resources of which I am a steward
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.520]   are now being used to kill the most innocent people
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.980]   in our society.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.700]   How do I do that?
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.020]   How do I look myself in the mirror?
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.720]   How do I look God in the face at the end of my life?
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.340]   How do I look my children in the face
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.900]   and know that I'm letting that happen?
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.560]   How do I do that?
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.440]   And I hope you understand why having the moral clarity
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.000]   that you and I have on the subject of abortion
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.280]   is so important to confronting this particular issue.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.320]   Because like I said, almost any other issue
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.480]   that you might be frustrated about,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.000]   you can make a counterargument.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.580]   Well, maybe we had to go and invade those terrorists
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.060]   because they were gonna come after us.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.960]   Maybe it's better that the war happens over there.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.680]   And after all, those hundreds of thousands of civilians
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.760]   over there that died because we invaded their country,
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.800]   well, they had it coming
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.840]   'cause they should have kicked the Taliban out.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.240]   Okay, well, maybe, right?
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.360]   Or, well, I don't really like Medicare,
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.800]   Medicaid and Social Security,
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.720]   but well, I'll just go ahead and pay them
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.960]   and at least just go into them.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.200]   Sorry, I don't know why I'm doing the accent.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.280]   But as you can see, you can justify most of anything,
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.100]   most anything.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.040]   Well, I don't think they should be running
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.720]   that drug program and giving away free needles and syringes,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.360]   but well, who knows?
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.640]   Maybe it would do some good.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.100]   And after all, we'll collect some data.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.480]   Almost any other issue, you can make a counterargument.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   The single most clarifying, morally obvious issue
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.960]   in our society is abortion.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Because the baby, the innocent party, always dies.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.020]   And that's what makes it so different.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.880]   So again, back to the thing,
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.200]   it's like, what do you do about that?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.640]   Lots of people think that, they believe that,
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.680]   but the question is, what do you do?
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.640]   And you've watched people try to figure it out.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.880]   You've seen the pro-life movement
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.300]   and people do all kinds of things to try to change that.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.280]   But it's one, there's a difference
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.520]   between knowing something is happening
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.960]   and you're not involved in it
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.920]   versus you being forced to now pay for it.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.380]   There's a difference between those things.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.660]   There's a difference between your neighbor going off
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.660]   and killing her baby, and you being required to pay
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.340]   for your neighbor to kill her baby.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.640]   Those two things are very different.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.860]   And so you get into the world of, what do I do?
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.100]   What do I do?
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.940]   So let me explain to you my thinking on the subject
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.940]   and how I tackled this, starting in about 2015, again, 2016.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.940]   The issue was, am I guilty of sin
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:16.700]   if I am paying tax money
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.840]   that is being used to pay for abortion?
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.360]   Am I morally responsible
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.740]   for what my tax money is paying for?
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.300]   Now, my answer to that is no.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.900]   To this day, it continues to be no.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.020]   I don't believe that you are morally responsible
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.080]   for what is done with your tax money.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.500]   Let me explain to you why,
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.380]   'cause that may sound a little funny or strange
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.080]   based upon what I'm about to say.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.100]   You don't have any choice
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.560]   in the taxes that are taken from you.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.580]   Taxation is inherently violent.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.860]   I don't love the saying that taxation is theft,
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.700]   but there's a real point to that say,
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.300]   that when taxes are taken from you, they are taken,
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.460]   and there is implicit violence in it.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.420]   You don't say, "I want to give you money."
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.980]   The money is being taken from you.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.380]   You're told how much you owe,
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.180]   and that money is taken from you.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.920]   And so if we use an analogy,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.220]   let's say that somebody comes and steals your car
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.560]   out of your front yard.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.820]   They take the car from you without your permission.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.660]   So they steal the car from your front yard.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.700]   And let's say that they drive it down the street
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.060]   at 100 miles an hour,
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.140]   and they run over a little girl who's crossing the street,
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.620]   and they kill her.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.660]   Are you morally responsible for what has been done
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.940]   with your property that has been taken from you?
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.860]   In my example, I don't think you are.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.260]   I really don't.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.940]   And so whether your car is stolen from you
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.540]   or taken from your driveway and used to kill someone,
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.820]   or whether your money is taken from you
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.800]   and used to kill someone innocent,
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.620]   I don't think that you are morally responsible for that.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:20.620]   But let me change the circumstances just a little bit.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.180]   Let's assume that you have a car,
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.180]   and the car is sitting in your driveway.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.660]   And for whatever reason, maybe you came from the country
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.820]   or you wanna prove how safe your city is,
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.260]   you have developed a habit
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.740]   of just leaving your keys in the car.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.020]   After all, you don't wanna be bothered
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.460]   going and looking for them in the morning,
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.680]   so you just leave your keys in the car.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.900]   And your living room is near your driveway,
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.900]   and you like to sit in your living room in the evening
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.140]   and read books with the window open.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.420]   And you hear some young teenagers coming down the street,
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.580]   and you hear these young teenage men saying to each other,
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.860]   hey, look, look, look, there's a car with keys in it.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.900]   Hey, man, we should take that car.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.620]   And another one says, ah, no, man, come on,
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.820]   that'd be wrong, that'd be stealing, let's not do that.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.460]   Oh, okay, and they go on down the road.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.020]   Then the next night, you're sitting in your living room
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:09.940]   reading your book,
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.020]   and you hear those boys coming down the sidewalk.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.020]   Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look, those keys are in it again.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.660]   This guy must leave his keys in his car every night.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.980]   And the other guy says, no, no, no, don't touch it, man.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.280]   Come on, that's not right.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.340]   And this goes on for a while.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.960]   And then you continue to leave your keys in the car.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:35.500]   And then one night, the boys come down the sidewalk.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.540]   They decide to take the car.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.940]   They take the car, they drive it 100 miles an hour.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.620]   They run over the innocent little girl crossing the street,
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.940]   and they kill her.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.140]   Are you morally responsible for the death of that girl?
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:53.460]   My answer is yes, absolutely you are, to some degree.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.100]   I don't know to what degree.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.900]   You're certainly not as responsible
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.140]   as the boys who stole the car are.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.620]   And I don't know what the proper penalty is for that.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.940]   But if I'm sitting on a jury,
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.400]   and somebody described the circumstances
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.460]   that have just been described,
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.940]   I would vote guilty of something.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.380]   Again, I don't know what legal thing it would be,
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.300]   but the heart of justice rises up and says,
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.380]   like, you're a competent man.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.220]   You should understand that you shouldn't put temptation
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.700]   in front of people like that.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.740]   And what's worse is you had warning.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.180]   Not only should you have known
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.660]   you don't leave your keys in the car,
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.940]   you're not proving anything by this little thing,
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.460]   but you heard these boys being tempted to steal your car.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.060]   And as a mature, competent man,
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.980]   you knew that nothing good could come of that.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.900]   You had fair and ample warning
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.340]   of the harm that could have come from your actions.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.460]   And because of your non-action and your unwillingness
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.220]   to change the circumstances of your life,
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.260]   or to do even the smallest thing
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.060]   to diminish that risk of exposure,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.740]   or excuse me, diminish the temptation,
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:15.860]   you're guilty of some moral wrongness in that situation.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.620]   So bring it back now to taxation.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.940]   This was what bothered me.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:26.940]   I don't think that you are morally guilty
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.340]   for what is done with your tax dollars.
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.620]   And if you're making $50,000 a year,
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.940]   and you're paying, at that rate,
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.140]   you're not paying any federal income taxes,
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.020]   but let's just say you're paying a few thousand dollars
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.900]   of taxes that are being used to pay
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.180]   for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.220]   Okay, fine, there's no moral guilt.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.820]   And if you're making $100,000,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.020]   and there's a little bit of federal income tax
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.740]   that is taken from you,
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.380]   well, you might bear some, you know, it's taken from you.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.900]   You're not guilty.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.340]   But what if you know you have the potential
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.900]   of making a million dollars a year,
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.860]   $10 million a year, or whatever the number is?
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:15.060]   So let's assume that with previously,
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.980]   you may have contributed financially
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.740]   to the death of one innocent baby every two years.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.980]   But now you're gonna make a lot of money,
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.380]   and now you're gonna fund the death
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.020]   of three innocent babies per year.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:34.140]   Do you not bear some moral guilt of some kind
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.420]   for making it easy for them to take your money,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.100]   and making it easy for them to take lots of money?
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.860]   Again, there's a difference between a bicycle
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.820]   being left out in your yard and a car.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.260]   This is my analogy.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.980]   If you leave a bicycle in your front yard,
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.820]   and you hear some boys talking about it,
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.260]   well, the smart man would go and put it in the backyard.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.820]   But you don't necessarily have to lock up the bicycle
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.140]   every single day, and take all kinds of care
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.100]   and caution about it, 'cause it's a bicycle.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.740]   On the other hand, a car is a dangerous machine.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.420]   It's an extremely dangerous implement
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.260]   that is capable of causing death and destruction.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.620]   And so you absolutely have to lock up a car
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.940]   and take it more seriously because of its size.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.220]   So it's one thing for the guy whose wages
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.260]   don't result in much tax money
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.420]   to not worry too much about it.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.500]   It's another thing for the guy
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.020]   who's gonna put millions of dollars
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.460]   into the government coffers to not even think about it.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.660]   And that was what I spent a lot of time thinking about.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:39.020]   Now, when Donald Trump won the election,
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.740]   I felt a great sense of relief
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.060]   because my moral crisis had been slightly averted.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.820]   And that was something that was greatly encouraging to me.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.660]   But it still bothered me that I had been possibly put
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.820]   into this situation.
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.740]   And I said, "I gotta do something about this."
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.500]   But I didn't know what to do.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.540]   Over time, my business was making more money,
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.380]   but my goals were, at the time, shifting
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.020]   from just building a lifestyle business
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.900]   to making lots more money.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.620]   And I thought, "I should put a plan in place."
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.380]   And with all the other factors that I've said as well
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.660]   in previous episodes,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.980]   this was a big moral factor that motivated me.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.500]   Because I saw how, if I could create a way
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.020]   to not owe the US government tax,
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:29.020]   then I could keep my conscience clear and follow the law.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.300]   And to me, that is something we should always strive for.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.580]   We want to follow the law and keep our conscience clear.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.100]   I believe that we should try our very best
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.500]   to heed both things.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.340]   It's not always possible.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.300]   There's a famous quote by Friedrich Bastiat
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.060]   that I read in "The Law."
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.220]   And you can find my recording of that pamphlet
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.820]   in the "Annals of Radical Personal Finance."
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.540]   Again, Bastiat, B-A-S-T-I-A-T, "The Law."
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.100]   You can search and find it.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.020]   But in that, he said,
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.460]   "When law and morality contradict each other,
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.420]   "the citizen has the cruel alternative
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.940]   "of either losing his moral sense
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.460]   "or losing his respect for the law."
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.220]   And I believe that is true.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.420]   But we should not hasten the arrival of that thing
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.820]   if at all possible.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.620]   We should try to maintain our moral sense
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.140]   as well as our respect for the law as far as we can.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.940]   And the world of internationalization offered me
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.940]   kind of an elegant escape.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.220]   Now, I never saw anybody talk about this.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.940]   My own path into the world of internationalization
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.020]   was very different than most people's.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.940]   Mine started with a book.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.460]   I read the book "P.T." by W.G. Hill.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.860]   Couldn't tell you today how I found it.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.540]   I had previously been a fan of Harry Brown
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.500]   and some of his work and his book
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.620]   on how I found freedom in an unfree world, et cetera.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.580]   And he and his ilk were involved
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.660]   in kind of the movement of the 1980s
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.780]   that was encapsulated in the old book
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.980]   by W.G. Hill called "P.T."
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.020]   But although that book was written
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.620]   with a very aggressive tone
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.380]   and very much a matter of get out and get up,
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.380]   get what you want and protect yourself and all that stuff,
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.060]   I found the ideas in it compelling.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.620]   And that was the thing that sparked my own journey
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.500]   into internationalization
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.700]   because I realized that there was a lifeline,
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.740]   that internationalization was a lifeline
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   to my ability to maintain my sense of respect for morality,
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:45.260]   to clear my, to keep a clear conscience,
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.660]   as well as to maintain a respect for the law.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.940]   And let me explain why.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.620]   Let's assume that you are considering
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.140]   becoming a tax protester.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.060]   You're considering not paying taxes for some reason.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.900]   Maybe it's something like abortion.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.100]   Maybe it's something like war.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.020]   Maybe it's just, you don't think you should.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.380]   You have two basic pathways that you can pursue.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.740]   You have the pathway of illegal tax evasion,
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.740]   or you have the pathway of legal tax avoidance.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.900]   So I think of that as illegal.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.980]   I'm gonna break the law,
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   knowingly, intentionally break the law,
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.180]   or I'm going to follow the law,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.620]   but just use the law to my benefit.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.580]   So let's go down the illegal pathway first.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.420]   Let's assume that you are considering not paying taxes.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.340]   You said, "I'm gonna get paid in cash.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.740]   "Not gonna report my income,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.140]   "not gonna file tax returns, et cetera,"
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.900]   whatever your pathway is to illegal tax evasion.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.460]   Well, I think there's a couple big problems with that.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.940]   For me, I face a moral problem,
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.540]   and the moral problem is I can't do it
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.100]   because I'm a Christian.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.700]   And the Christian scriptures are crystal clear.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.620]   Basically, every single place that you turn,
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.140]   that Christians have a duty to pay their taxes.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.660]   It's basically inescapable.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.660]   I have searched and searched and searched
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.020]   for an alternative,
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.740]   but if you are one who is seeking to follow
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.420]   the guidance of Christian scriptures,
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.140]   there's no out of it.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.180]   Every single time, in the Gospels,
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.140]   Jesus said, "Pay your taxes."
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.180]   In all of the New Testament letters,
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.300]   every writer says, "Pay your taxes."
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.620]   Peter says, "Pay your taxes."
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.940]   Paul says, "Pay your taxes."
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.940]   Every single one of them says, "Pay your taxes."
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.860]   And they say it in varying ways.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.020]   "Pay your taxes and honor the emperor."
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.660]   It's said again and again and again
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.420]   in all kinds of different ways.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.700]   And so your counter-argument might be,
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.820]   "Well, that's because they had,
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.380]   "you know, their government wasn't as bad as mine."
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.620]   Ha! (laughs)
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.340]   Think about who you're talking about.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.980]   Jesus was a subject of the Roman government.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.860]   The Roman government,
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.540]   one of the most barbaric, violent empires of all time.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.220]   The early Christian writers,
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.100]   Saint Peter, Saint Paul, et cetera,
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.860]   they're writing in a time when,
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.780]   I mean, for crying out loud,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.900]   Nero is dunking Christians in oil
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.020]   and sticking them up as torches in his garden.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.980]   I mean, the persecution of Christians is enormous.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.660]   Christians are dying left and right.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.740]   And still, the early Christian fathers are saying,
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.220]   "Pay your taxes."
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.340]   And so how do you get more evil than Nero?
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.620]   I don't know.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.660]   I hope we never, ever again see someone like him.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.220]   But the point is that I don't find any escape in that.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.580]   So Christian conviction makes me say,
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.660]   "I need to follow the law."
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.820]   Now, I wanna quickly say that
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.860]   I'm not sure that that always is 100%.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.860]   There may be times in which that just can't be done,
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.820]   but it's certainly 99%.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.300]   It's certainly, if a Christian is going to not pay tax
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.860]   that he legally owes,
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.860]   it had better be done with a whole lot of conviction
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.580]   and not just a casual, "Well, no big deal.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.420]   "It's not a big deal."
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.340]   It is a big deal.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.460]   And what's interesting, too, a very brief sidebar,
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.180]   is I think this is one of the things
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.340]   that God has designed to help,
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.820]   I mean, the message flourish.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.820]   I always think of the Jews
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.700]   when they were sent into captivity.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.740]   And there's an amazing verse in,
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.300]   let's see, they were under the Babylonian Empire,
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.140]   I think, at the time.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.140]   And there's a verse that says,
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.380]   listen, God's sending you into captivity in judgment.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.940]   Build houses, plant gardens, and seek the good of the city.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.540]   That even when the Jews were forced into captivity,
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.260]   were taken as slaves,
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.260]   they were instructed to seek the good of the city.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.620]   And all of the Christian encouragement to slaves,
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.180]   to literal slaves in the New Testament,
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.700]   is to be a good slave, to honor your master,
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.940]   to be obedient, to seek what's good.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.340]   And I think that it's a perfect example
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.620]   of how turning the other cheek
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.460]   and doing good to those who hate you
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.420]   and revile against you is such a fundamental thing.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:09.420]   So I can't condone illegal tax evasion for that reason.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:16.220]   On a practical reason, I think illegal tax evasion is dumb
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.620]   because you lose all your energy
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.340]   looking over your shoulders all the time
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.540]   and you cause yourself to be vulnerable.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.740]   And what the machine always wants is tax money.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.080]   Famously, it's often taxes
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.560]   that result in catching criminals.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.740]   And it's the tax enforcers
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.820]   who have the energy to chase down the criminals.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.140]   The most famous, of course, would be Al Capone,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.340]   where they finally nailed him for tax evasion.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.660]   But taxes are a big deal to rulers.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.340]   And if you don't pay them their taxes,
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.820]   they will come and bring their armies
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.260]   and put you in prison.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.060]   And what's the point of having money
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.820]   if you wind up sitting in prison?
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:58.940]   Tax evasion causes you to not get the real fruit of wealth,
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.300]   which is peace of mind and safety and relaxation, et cetera.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.540]   And so if you get rich because of tax evasion,
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.540]   you got problems.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.940]   You never sleep well at night
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.820]   and it's just not worth it.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.640]   So I don't think there's any point
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.660]   in going down the illegal path.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.180]   I guess I would add one more argument against it.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.980]   If you're gonna go down the path of illegal tax evasion,
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.020]   you have to be prepared, mentally prepared,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.460]   to sit yourself in prison
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.220]   because that's probably what's gonna happen,
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.140]   especially if you're high profile.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.660]   Every year in the United States,
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.700]   the IRS pursues high-profile tax evaders.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.540]   They put them in prison.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.140]   They get as much news out of it as they can
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.380]   because they try to share by intimidation.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.580]   Look, this is what happens if you are a tax evader.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.540]   And so people wind up sitting in prison.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.060]   And I just imagine my children,
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.660]   Mommy, why is Daddy in prison?
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.700]   Well, Daddy didn't wanna pay his taxes.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.540]   Why not?
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.700]   Why didn't I wanna pay his taxes?
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.780]   Daddy didn't wanna pay for abortion.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   Well, what good does Daddy do to us if he's in prison?
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.620]   It just doesn't fit.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.740]   So there's no, what's the point of sitting in prison?
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.700]   That doesn't do any good.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.180]   It doesn't do my children any good.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.860]   It doesn't do my neighbor any good.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.500]   It doesn't even do my cause any good.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.060]   My sitting in prison, if I'm in prison,
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.780]   it better be for a good reason.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.140]   So let's come back from the illegal path.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.140]   Let's go down now the legal path.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.860]   Let's say that you don't wanna pay tax,
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.620]   but you're committed to following the law.
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.860]   Well, you got a couple of options for that.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.180]   You can live in the United States
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.420]   and you can live completely income tax-free
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.940]   or mostly income tax-free.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.560]   And there are a variety of ways to do that.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.500]   In many cases, you would be restricting yourself
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.220]   to a relatively low income.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.420]   So somebody who makes just a little bit of money
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.260]   generally is not gonna pay a lot of tax.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.260]   You got a bunch of children like I do,
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.940]   you can earn quite a decent amount of money
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.060]   and not pay any tax 'cause your child tax credits
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.300]   and things like that.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.940]   If you own a business and you can deduct
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.940]   some of your business expenses through your business,
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.900]   you might lower your taxes.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.900]   You can live in a very tax-efficient lifestyle.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.780]   I mean, just imagine a guy out homesteading
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.740]   in the wilderness.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.980]   He might have a job where he works a couple days a week,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.260]   earns a few thousand dollars a month,
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.580]   but he grows a big garden,
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.900]   he gathers his wood from the forest.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.500]   He has a very low imprint on the land
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.220]   and he himself doesn't owe much.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.000]   He doesn't owe any taxes because of the way
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.700]   that he's done his lifestyle.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.140]   If you're smart, you can earn a pretty decent amount
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:40.660]   of money and still do it with tax-free.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.100]   You can have a pretty decent amount of real estate
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.380]   and with your depreciation expenses, eliminate your tax.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.460]   You might do things like doing tax-free kinds
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.140]   of wealth creation where instead of creating income,
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.800]   you create asset value.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.300]   You might do things like buy a house, fix it up,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.000]   move out, sell it, shelter the taxable gains
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   in your Section 121 exclusion, et cetera.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.480]   And you can do pretty decently for yourself.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.360]   You might have a handful of businesses
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   that are carefully selected to have benefits
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.720]   both of lifestyle business
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.560]   as well as profit-generating businesses, et cetera.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.280]   So you can do it living in the United States.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.780]   And I think that would be a fine way to do it.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.740]   The problem that I myself faced when I thought about that
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.200]   is basically you're still,
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.520]   you're kind of committing yourself to,
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.760]   you're at least committing yourself to the possibility
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.200]   of continually being poor.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.440]   And I had a hard time just thinking
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.880]   of staring my kids in the face like,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.840]   "Mommy, why are we poor?
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.400]   Daddy, why are we poor?"
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.900]   "Well, 'cause I don't wanna pay tax."
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.120]   "Why don't you wanna pay tax?"
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.760]   "I don't wanna pay for abortion."
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.840]   "But aren't you like a financial advisor?
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.740]   Shouldn't you know something about how to make money?"
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.600]   "Well, yeah, but still, I'm just gonna stay poor."
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.620]   It doesn't seem very honorable to me.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.480]   So that was a path, that is a path.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.400]   And I think that's a potential path
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.080]   for some people who have those concerns,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.360]   but it doesn't seem great.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.000]   So then we flip.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.040]   What if you move?
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.160]   One of the things that I realized was,
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.480]   by reading PT, (laughs)
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   was that almost anything you want to do is legal somewhere.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.040]   Almost anything you want to do is legal somewhere.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.540]   And while I certainly don't,
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.140]   and I'm not a libertine and I don't wanna be one,
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.460]   but I appreciate the work those '80s libertarian,
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.660]   libertine playboys did of pointing that out.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.900]   The classic example is, let's say,
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.420]   during Prohibition in the United States.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.260]   If you wanted to drink alcohol,
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.780]   all you had to do was leave the United States.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.100]   So you could leave the United States and go to Cuba.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.780]   Drink your alcohol, no risk of arrest.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.700]   You could leave the United States, go to France,
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.060]   go to Mexico, you'd go to any number of places
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.140]   to drink alcohol, and there was no fear of arrest.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:10.140]   And so this thing that is forbidden in one place
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.100]   is perfectly legal in another place.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.020]   Recently, I was in Amsterdam.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.220]   I'm sitting in Amsterdam, the entire,
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.500]   I was staying in a kind of a hostel type of thing.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.520]   It was a hotel, but it was a hostel.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.940]   It's hard to find rooms when you need seven beds.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.820]   And so I wound up with a hostel there
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.260]   because it had six beds in it, plus a crib for the baby.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:35.260]   And the whole hostel is just full of druggies
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.940]   coming into Amsterdam from all over Europe
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.380]   to party for the weekend.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.380]   They stank like crazy, and I'm just sitting
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.700]   in the elevator listening to them,
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.520]   and they're going on about all the things they're doing.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.780]   But it's a perfect example of, hey, you wanna do drugs?
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.380]   Well, we'll go to Amsterdam and do drugs
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.760]   'cause we can't do the drugs we wanna do at home.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.660]   It's a lot smarter to do that than it is to do drugs at home
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.660]   and face the risk of getting arrested.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.900]   Wanna drive your car at 150 miles an hour?
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.620]   Well, there's places in the world where,
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.100]   I mean, the Germans believe that's your God-given right.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.700]   Don't have many other rights,
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.060]   but that's your God-given right.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.460]   And as long as you go on the stretches of the Audubon
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.740]   where you can do it, that's fine, or any number of things.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.560]   And so any vice that you want to indulge,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.740]   you can find someplace in the world
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.360]   where that vice is accepted, nay, celebrated,
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.560]   and thus you can avoid your legal issues.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.860]   Anyway, as I thought about that, I realized, wait a second,
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.740]   taxes are optional.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:39.340]   And while I may be under a Christian duty
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.200]   to pay the taxes that I owe,
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.460]   I do not see any Christian duty
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.060]   to live in any one particular place,
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.100]   unless I personally feel a strong call from God to be there.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.540]   That's a separate thing.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.180]   But on a broad-scale basis,
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.300]   no preacher's gonna stand up and preach a sermon
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.300]   that you gotta live in this particular place.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.020]   So if I have the freedom to move,
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.800]   then I have the freedom to choose whether or not I owe tax.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.120]   And I don't wanna, this is such an unusual conversation,
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.420]   I know, but I don't wanna go on too long,
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.900]   but I do wanna let you know
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.220]   that brought me an incredible sense of peace and freedom,
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.100]   because I realized I can follow my conscience
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.560]   and I can follow the law.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:35.960]   That, after facing this black chasm,
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.620]   this enormous moral dilemma
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:44.260]   that I didn't know the answer to,
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.120]   and I don't wanna over-speak,
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.200]   like I don't wanna make it sound
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.220]   like I'm sitting around for hundreds of hours
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.560]   just doing this, but it is a big deal to me.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.480]   I'm not willing to murder babies,
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.200]   and I'm not willing to pay for the murder of babies.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.060]   The babies are innocent.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.240]   No one else is, but the babies are innocent.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.720]   So we can come to agreement on that,
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.040]   and we can figure out how to stop that.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.640]   And it's ridiculous in the United States.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.780]   I mean, for crying out loud,
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.280]   Hamas went into Israel some weeks ago.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   Hamas is smart enough to murder the babies of their enemies.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.200]   The United States Army doesn't even murder the babies
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.560]   of any enemies on purpose,
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.440]   but Hamas murdered the babies of their enemies.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.260]   But we're so stupid that though we tell our army
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.560]   not to murder the babies of our enemies,
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.780]   we murder our own babies, tens of millions of them,
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.040]   and it's horrific.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.560]   Not only is it morally horrific,
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.280]   but it's practically horrific.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.480]   The US population should be 500 million,
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.120]   600 million by now,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.400]   but we've murdered hundreds of millions of babies,
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.720]   probably 87, what is it, the current number,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.680]   70, 80 million by surgical abortion,
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.120]   bazillions more with chemical abortions
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.480]   and pills and whatnot.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.720]   It's terrible.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.340]   We have this country that probably needs a billion people,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.920]   maybe two to start getting traction.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.280]   We have an incredible society that could do this.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.660]   We have incredible resources, and we squander it all.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.640]   And we destroy our own children.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.200]   It's the most barbaric, evil thing in history.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.480]   So it is a big deal to me.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:18.160]   And the idea of being involved in that
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.760]   and being forcibly involved in that,
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.200]   I find pretty horrific.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.580]   So back to the point.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.240]   When I realized I could leave,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.480]   I said, "I have a choice.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.800]   "I have a choice."
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:38.320]   And to have a choice and then make a different decision,
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.700]   I think is really key.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.540]   So for example, I talked to you about being drafted.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:50.980]   I think to have the choice to know I could leave,
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   but I'm not going to,
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.640]   I'm gonna go and I'm gonna serve in the military,
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.380]   that's the right way to do it,
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.160]   to know you have the choice to leave but not do it.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:08.520]   For someone to know I have the choice to avoid this tax,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:14.280]   but I'm going to choose to pay it
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.640]   because I believe something is more important,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.840]   that's the right thing.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.240]   I have the choice to leave this country
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.660]   where everything is bad,
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.880]   but because of my love for my neighbor,
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.360]   I'm going to choose to live here.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   I have the choice to run away and save myself,
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.280]   but I'm gonna stay.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.800]   If you think about honor,
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.840]   this is one of the things that's so integral
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.720]   to our culture.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:46.160]   Why do we expect men to lay down their lives
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.140]   for women and children?
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.800]   Why do we expect men to put women and children
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.520]   in the lifeboat and stay on the sinking ship?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.760]   Because we know those men have a choice.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.680]   Those men could toss all the women and children
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.920]   in the water, they could all get on the boat themselves
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.760]   and row away, but they don't.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.040]   They put the women and children in the lifeboats
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.160]   and they sacrifice themselves for the greater good.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.840]   So to me, I see having the choice to leave
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.920]   or having the choice to stay is the honorable thing
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.280]   and then you have the choice to,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.680]   you can make the choice when the individual circumstances
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.120]   present themselves.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.040]   Remember that when I was thinking about this
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.520]   from an international perspective,
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.400]   I'm not worried, I wasn't worried about,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.440]   once the 2016 election passed
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.300]   and I was not abroad at that time,
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.280]   then I wasn't worried particularly about this at that time.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.800]   And then amazingly, then of course,
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.720]   Roe v. Wade was overruled, et cetera.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.360]   And so there were a few kind of short-term gains
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.120]   for the pro-life people, et cetera.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.080]   Long way to go yet on that issue in the United States.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.120]   But it was more a matter of where could we be in 10 years?
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.400]   Where could we be in 20 years?
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.720]   Where could we be in 30 years?
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.300]   And I believe that you should always prepare far in advance.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.080]   It's easy, that's when it's easy,
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.400]   that's when it's cheap, is when you don't need it.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.240]   And so because of the circumstances in my life,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.820]   I said, I'm gonna go and do that.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.360]   Now let me just finish off, forgive me,
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.860]   I got a little sidetracked because I got emotional,
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.880]   but let me just finish off.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.240]   How does leaving the United States for a US citizen
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.200]   solve the tax problem?
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.420]   Well, first of all, you can use
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.920]   the foreign earned income exclusion
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   to shelter some of your tax money.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.560]   And so it's about a little over $120,000.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.500]   But in that situation, I could earn $120,000 living abroad
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.640]   and completely shelter that from tax
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.080]   just using the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.600]   And that can be done with all tax
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.860]   if I work for a foreign company, so that's nice.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.960]   But then of course, my wife may work as well.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.880]   It seems she might earn $120,000,
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.680]   so then we start to get into some useful money.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.580]   There are more ways that you can shelter more than that.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.420]   But at least I said,
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.880]   at least if I never renounced my US citizenship,
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.000]   at least I could earn some decent money
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.440]   and my children wouldn't be poor.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.920]   Well, daddy, why don't we live in the United States?
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.640]   I don't like to and I don't wanna pay for abortion.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.960]   Okay, fine, at least we're not poor.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.800]   We can deal with that.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.160]   And then they can choose to go to the United States
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.880]   if they want to and we can visit and et cetera.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.760]   And I could still be a loud mouth activist
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.720]   or something if I wanted to,
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.040]   but at least I followed the law as best I was able to.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.440]   Or I could ultimately, if I got another citizenship,
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.700]   I could ultimately renounce my citizenship.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.640]   And that is something that I thought a lot about
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.160]   and I wanted to be prepared for that.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.440]   Because if you're not a US citizen,
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   the world of tax planning opens up
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.920]   in just a completely different way.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.620]   It's only US citizens that have to pay taxes
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.600]   on their global income based upon their citizenship.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.040]   Every other country in the world, except Eritrea,
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.600]   every other country in the world lets its citizens leave.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.640]   And if you leave, you don't owe taxes.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.240]   And so, the obvious thing,
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.040]   you leave and you move to the Bahamas or to Dubai
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.080]   or to various other zero tax jurisdictions
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.160]   or to various territorial tax jurisdictions
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.720]   or various lump sum tax jurisdictions.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.040]   You can live in many of those places
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.080]   and you can choose your tax rate.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.120]   You can choose your tax rate
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.520]   and where from zero to as high as you want
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.360]   based upon what you value.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.680]   And for all non-US citizens, the world is basically a menu.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.120]   And so, I imagine myself making $10 million a year.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.360]   At least I can make $10 million a year and live tax-free.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.200]   I can live in the Bahamas, live in St. Kitts and Nevis,
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.120]   be somewhere close to the United States
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.760]   if I wanted to be, I could renounce my US citizenship,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.920]   hold simply a foreign citizenship.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.560]   I could have a visa to visit the United States.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.120]   My wife can still be a US citizen.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.400]   My children could be US citizens.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.040]   We could still come and go in the US.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.280]   And now I can make $10 million a year,
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.200]   pay $0 of tax and have everything squared away.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.520]   It's a great option.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.360]   But I couldn't do that
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.880]   if I didn't have another citizenship.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.760]   And so, that was where I realized
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.160]   if I'm gonna do this ever,
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.200]   maybe in 30 years or something like that,
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.480]   I'd like to have the choice.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.520]   And that means that I've gotta go.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.800]   I've gotta go and I've gotta get another citizenship,
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.680]   which is gonna make me have to move abroad.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.120]   And that was where birth tourism came in,
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.200]   where I said, "Hey, we're having a baby.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.920]   I knew a little bit about birth tourism.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.960]   Let's go use birth tourism as a way of getting residency.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.160]   Let's turn that residency into citizenship.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.040]   And then things will be better off."
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.240]   And even if we come back to the United States after that,
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.400]   then we'll have had a little bit of an adventure.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   We'll have enjoyed some time abroad.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.920]   My children will have options.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.200]   And though this never, ever be necessary,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   who knows, 75 years from now,
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.360]   it may be necessary for one of my descendants.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   And that, in sort of a nutshell, is my story.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.640]   There are other things,
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.200]   there are other factors and other reasons.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   I've watched so many people be imprisoned unjustly,
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.040]   especially in the United States over the last five years.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.680]   It's just astonishing how many people get imprisoned unjustly
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.960]   and other things.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.560]   There are other things that I could say,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   but those were my reasons.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:10.720]   And to recap, reason number one was just,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.760]   it sounds kind of fun.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.600]   It's an adventure.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.000]   Try it out, test it out.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.480]   Reason number two was I want options for my children.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.880]   I want my children to be freed
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.720]   from something like a military draft,
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.360]   if that were ever imposed on them.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.880]   And I want them freed from having to pay a lifetime
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.240]   of tax burden for a sinking empire.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.400]   And then reason number three was I have this moral problem
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.240]   and I saw an elegant way through it.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   And for me, that brought me an enormous sense of freedom.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.120]   And that sense of freedom has only continued.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.720]   When I left the United States,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.560]   I didn't know much about internationalization.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.920]   Basically, I had read PT and scarfed around,
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.360]   tried to find some other stuff on it.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.520]   And we were having a baby,
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.280]   so I learned a little bit about your birth tourism.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.480]   I got on a plane and went.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.200]   I didn't know much at all.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.240]   Didn't hire anybody.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.720]   I did it all myself.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.160]   Along the way, I read everything I could.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.320]   I studied everything I could.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.280]   I'm not the world's greatest expert, but I've done a lot.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.600]   And since then, I've put in place a bunch of flags,
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.840]   solved all my problems and got it all done.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   And it's been fun.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.040]   It's been hard.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.240]   It's been more time consuming than I thought.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.560]   If I were doing it over again,
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.760]   I would spend more money and less time.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.240]   That's one of the things that I did.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.040]   I said, "Well, I could spend time and not money."
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.480]   Today, I would spend more money and less time.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.760]   And there's other things as well,
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.000]   but I don't regret it for a bit
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.440]   because it has brought me that sense of freedom.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:45.440]   And what price do you put on a sense of freedom,
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.000]   on a sense of peace?
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   I've gained all kinds of other benefits
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.800]   that I never anticipated from going abroad.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.960]   I've gained greater appreciation
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.640]   for the country of my birth.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.800]   I've gained a much more relaxed,
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.400]   kind of even-keeled perception of reality.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.280]   And what's interesting is I recognize this
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   a lot of times now, sometimes in my consulting calls
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.760]   or listening to people.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.280]   People are freaked out about the direction
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.760]   of the country, et cetera.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.640]   And I recognize that that sense of fear,
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.440]   that sense of being freaked out,
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.000]   is in many cases an indicator of lack of preparation.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.560]   And once you start preparing for the thing that you fear,
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.120]   you will gain some measure of preparation
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.120]   and then some measure of a sense of fatality
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.800]   about what you can't prepare for.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.120]   But you have to go through the process of preparing for it.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.040]   And I think being prepared to leave your country
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.960]   is something that solves a lot of other issues.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.560]   And I talk about those other issues in my course.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:50.760]   It's funny, in one course, I stuck in this little comment
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.120]   on abortion that I've just shared with you.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.440]   Other than that, in five years,
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.440]   I have never shared this publicly.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.680]   Most of my other stuff has been on more practical stuff.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.640]   But I decided it was time and I would go ahead.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.160]   It's just quite personal, right?
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.960]   And so I thought I'd go ahead and share it with you,
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.440]   the honest truth of what was important to me.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.920]   So I just beg you, if you want any of that stuff,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.800]   if you want any of that sense of freedom,
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.880]   make a plan for internationalization.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.120]   Your plan doesn't have to be my plan.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.040]   In fact, it probably shouldn't be.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.840]   I have some unique benefits and things that made it easier
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.200]   for me to go abroad than other people.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.560]   I was already living in an RV,
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.200]   so I didn't have to get rid of all that much stuff
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.160]   'cause I'd already gotten rid of most of my stuff.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.320]   I have an internet-based business, so that was a benefit.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.560]   My wife was cool with it.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.640]   We were having a baby, so she's up for an adventure.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.080]   I didn't have to force her and drag her kicking and screaming
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.080]   to another country or anything like that.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.760]   And so there's been many other aspects of it,
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.480]   things that made it a little easier for me.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.520]   There's no question that it's hard for some people
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.520]   who are very static and stuck,
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.360]   and I don't think that everybody needs to internationalize.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.800]   Excuse me, let me rephrase that.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.360]   I don't think that everybody needs to go and move abroad.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.800]   In fact, I think most people probably shouldn't.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.280]   I've become more skeptical of moving abroad
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.800]   since being abroad, not for me,
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.560]   but for many people because I've seen a lot of people
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.360]   try to move abroad and then wind up
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.560]   going back to their home country.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.080]   And I've learned a lot through coaching them,
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.280]   through listening to them, et cetera.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.920]   That's why in my course, International Escape Plan,
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.000]   I teach phases.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.080]   And so I think everybody should do phase one.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.000]   I think that 98% of people should do phase one and phase two.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.400]   Then it drops to maybe 35 to 40% of people
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.280]   should do phase three,
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.080]   and I don't know, 10% of people should do phase four.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.920]   But it's something that you have to choose.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:51.200]   But for me, I have found a huge amount of freedom
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.520]   on these issues by doing what I have done,
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.240]   and I wouldn't trade that for anything.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.360]   It's brought me just a sense of knowing.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.840]   And then if I go back,
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.520]   I probably, the next one in this series,
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.240]   I'll go ahead and record a show.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.240]   I wanna be careful.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.080]   Am I ready to say this?
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.160]   I guess I will.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.640]   I'll go ahead and record a show on why I might
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.040]   or probably will move back to the United States
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.280]   in the future.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.360]   But that's only possible for me
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.480]   after having made a plan to leave.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   Because if you don't, again, if you're stuck,
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.480]   it's hard to feel good about it.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.160]   But if you know you have the choice
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.080]   and you can leave at any time,
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.120]   and you can leave and go and come back,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.880]   I mean, we're in the smallest world we've ever lived in
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.040]   where an airplane flight and you're there and it's done.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.700]   And when you're a citizen of a place, it's great.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.360]   You just show back up, everything picks up.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:47.160]   It's one of the things I tell expats in general,
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.300]   unless you need to do it for tax planning purposes,
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.840]   you wanna maintain a whole infrastructure.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.000]   So I maintain an entire infrastructure
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:55.840]   in the United States.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.280]   I have a US passport, I have a US driver's license,
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.200]   I have a US mailing address, I have US credit cards,
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.040]   I have US banking, I have US phone, et cetera.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.760]   And so I'm just, it works.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.280]   I don't have to, I walk into the country and I'm set up.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.340]   All I need is a place to live.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:12.640]   And I got that covered on Airbnb in about 10 minutes.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.700]   So this stuff is a lot easier
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.720]   once you start going down that path.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.560]   Let me end it there.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.380]   Thank you for listening.
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.360]   I wanna promote for just a moment as I go,
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   lend me your ear, please.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.640]   I do have a course, internationalskateplan.com.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.480]   If you've never thought about internationalization
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.880]   or you're looking for the fastest answers,
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.920]   internationalskateplan.com, buy my course,
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.560]   internationalskateplan.com.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.960]   Remember also that in January of 2024,
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.800]   I am hosting an event.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.720]   You have to sign up now.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.800]   I'm hosting an event with Mikkel Thorup
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.440]   and Gabriel Custodiat in Panama City, Panama.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.200]   And I really want you to come to that.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.360]   I really do.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.840]   I think we're good on signups,
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.180]   but we do have space for a few more.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.320]   And I really want you to come to that.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.800]   I want you to come to that just so we can hang out.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.440]   I promise you it'll be worth your while.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.280]   You're gonna love it.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.520]   Panama City is a great city.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.780]   It's a world city.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.140]   It's fantastic.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.000]   It's got lots and lots going for it.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.120]   Panama itself is an awesome plan B
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.400]   or plan A for many people.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.080]   And I haven't gone deeply into the benefits of Panama
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.320]   just 'cause I like to be fairly even handed,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.080]   but we're gonna do all the benefits of Panama.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.480]   We're gonna talk about the use of Panama
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.920]   as a residency designation.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.680]   They have various super simple
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.980]   and straightforward, easy residencies.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.480]   You can get a residency.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.040]   They have great banking options, great business options.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.920]   It's an extremely tax-friendly place,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.480]   very well-connected place.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.720]   It's a great option.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.400]   And so if you're interested in Panama,
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.400]   you definitely should come to this event.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.000]   Even if you're interested in Panama,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.720]   but mostly interested in even just global stuff, still come.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.360]   Because we're gonna be together for a week
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.520]   and we'll talk about everything.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.280]   There's not gonna be anything that's off the table.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.880]   It's gonna be a great networking opportunity.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.720]   I'm gonna be there.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.640]   My friends are gonna be there.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.760]   I really want you to come.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.640]   I think it's a great deal.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.280]   I forget, if I remembered the price off the top of my head,
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   I would tell you, but I think it's a perfectly,
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.320]   it's a great price.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.160]   Everything's taken care of for you.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.600]   I've just gotten back from six weeks of traveling.

[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.240]   and planned out for you trips more than I ever did,
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:15.240]   because my head is exploded of all the reservations
