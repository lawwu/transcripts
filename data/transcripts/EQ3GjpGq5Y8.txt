[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.280]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.120]   Today, we are talking about the science of heat,
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.040]   and more specifically, the science of heating, the verb,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.440]   meaning how our body heats up
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.200]   from both the outside and the inside.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.960]   Heat is a remarkable stimulus,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.240]   meaning when we are in a hot environment,
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.520]   it has a profound effect on our biology.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.280]   And heating up from the outside,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.320]   or as you'll soon learn, from the inside,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.720]   has a profound effect on many different aspects
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.760]   of our health, including our metabolism,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.320]   both in the immediate and long-term, our cognition,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   meaning our ability to think more or less clearly.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.380]   And if you're immediately thinking
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.920]   that heating up makes you less capable of thinking,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.360]   you're wrong.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   Heat applied properly as a stimulus
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.120]   can engage certain neurochemical systems
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.300]   in your brain and body
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.180]   that can allow your brain to function far better.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.080]   We will talk about those data today.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.000]   So we're going to talk about the science of heat and heating,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.080]   both in terms of their mechanisms,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.760]   and as I know many of you are interested in,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.220]   the tools related to the use of heat,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.440]   things like sauna, how often to do sauna,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.860]   how long to be in the sauna,
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.160]   how hot to be in the sauna for particular goals and outcomes.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.440]   We're also going to talk about
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.120]   the very exciting new science around local heating,
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.840]   that is the use of heat applied to specific areas
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.860]   of the body in order to heal or improve tissues
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.740]   at that location that you are heating,
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.840]   as well as your biology and health overall.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.260]   In fact, we are going to talk about
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.640]   one very recently published paper
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.600]   that came out in the journal Cell.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.680]   Cell is one of the three apex journals,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920]   meaning three of the most competitive,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.080]   most rigorous scientific journals.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.040]   Those are Nature, Science, and Cell.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.080]   This particular paper was published in Cell,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.340]   and I will go into it in more detail later.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.100]   But basically what this paper shows
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.760]   is that by locally heating up skin and fat,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.280]   you can change the identity of certain fat cells
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.540]   at that location and elsewhere.
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.980]   We have three kinds of fat,
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.800]   white fat, beige fat, and brown fat.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.360]   And as you will learn more about soon,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.560]   white fat is not very metabolically active.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.520]   It's more of a fuel reserve.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.440]   It's what we typically think of as blubbery fat.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   Beige fat and brown fat are rich in mitochondria,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.320]   and those mitochondria provide a sort of furnace
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   or heating mechanism for your entire body
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.360]   and increase your metabolism and the burning of white fat.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.200]   So in other words,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.000]   having more beige fat and brown fat is a good thing.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.420]   And it turns out that the proper application of heat
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.300]   to specific areas of your body
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.860]   can increase the conversion of white fat to beige fat.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.320]   In other words, turn an innocuous fuel source
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.600]   into a metabolically active tissue
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.640]   that can help you burn off more white fat.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.400]   I think many people are going to be interested in this paper
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.840]   and the tools that emerge from this paper.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.640]   It's a fascinating set of findings
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.880]   that actually emerged from my understanding
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.240]   of the biology of burn and people who receive intense burns.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.820]   And that is not what I'm going to recommend to you
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.280]   as a tool, of course,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.920]   but understanding a little bit about how burns impact
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.320]   our biology and health
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.800]   has allowed these pioneering researchers
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.400]   to develop new tools to combat obesity
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.560]   and metabolic disorders,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.700]   and that you can apply for basic things like fat loss.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.200]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.840]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.040]   Our motivation for partnering with Momentous
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.920]   is to provide people one location where they can go
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.680]   to access the highest quality supplements
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.700]   in the specific dosages that are best supported
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.240]   by the scientific research
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.420]   and that are discussed during various episodes
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.440]   If you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.000]   you will see those formulations.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.480]   I should mention that we are going to add more formulations
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.220]   in the months to come.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.740]   And you will see specific suggestions
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.640]   about how best to take those supplements,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   meaning what dosages and times of day,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.540]   and in fact, how to combine those supplements
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.820]   with specific behavioral protocols
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.460]   that have been discussed on the podcast
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.760]   and are science supported
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.280]   in order to derive the maximum benefit
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.760]   from those supplements.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.800]   And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.400]   that Momentous ships not just within the United States,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.080]   but also internationally.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.800]   So once again, if you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.320]   you will find what we firmly believe
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.360]   to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.000]   and the best protocols for taking those supplements
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.820]   along with the ideal behavioral protocols
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.900]   to combine with those supplement formulations.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.740]   I'm pleased to announce
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.120]   that I am hosting two live events in May, 2022.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.660]   The first live event will take place
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.400]   in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.940]   The second live event will take place
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.480]   in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.320]   Both are part of a lecture series entitled
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.280]   during which I will talk about science
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.660]   and science-based tools,
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.820]   many of which overlap with the topics covered
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.420]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.360]   but most of which will not
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.600]   and will be completely new topics and tools
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.380]   never discussed publicly before.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.080]   Both live events will also include
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.820]   a question and answer period
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.220]   during which you, the audience,
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.980]   can ask me questions directly
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.800]   about any aspect of science or science-based tools
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.820]   and I will attempt to answer them.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.120]   Tickets for the two events,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.280]   again, Seattle on May 17th and Portland on May 18th,
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.360]   are both available at hubermanlab.com/tour.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.020]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.860]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.740]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.540]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.800]   about science and science-related tools
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.200]   to the general public.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.240]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.920]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.740]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.180]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.620]   that has everything you need
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.120]   and none of what you don't need, meaning sugar.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.320]   It has electrolytes and the main electrolytes
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.560]   are sodium, potassium, and magnesium,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.280]   which you need in the proper ratios
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.060]   in order for your brain and body to function correctly.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.400]   Element was designed to get you
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.480]   the proper ratio of electrolytes
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.020]   in order to optimize mental and physical performance.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.520]   People out there with pre-hypertension and hypertension,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.060]   of course, should be cautious
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.860]   about increasing their sodium intake,
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.760]   but many people can actually benefit
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.840]   from increasing their sodium intake,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.960]   both for health and for performance.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.400]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.500]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.960]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.500]   I consume Element when I first wake up in the morning,
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.020]   during exercise, and after exercise,
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.740]   and sometimes, again, if I've been sweating profusely,
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.520]   for instance, after doing a sauna
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   or taking a run on a hot day, things of that sort.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.180]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.000]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.800]   to claim a free Element sample pack.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.480]   You only cover the cost of shipping.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.240]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.940]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.340]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.120]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.700]   to help you better understand your body
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.720]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.600]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.840]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.140]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.080]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.840]   There are a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.060]   but a major issue with many of them
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.840]   is that you get numbers back about levels of hormones,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.820]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.880]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.920]   Inside Tracker has solved that problem
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.300]   by creating a personalized dashboard.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.840]   So you take your blood and/or your DNA test,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.200]   you get the results back,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.980]   and where certain values might be too high
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.000]   or too low for your preference,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.240]   you can click on that and it will direct you immediately
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.940]   to lifestyle factors, nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.760]   that can help you bring those numbers back into the ranges
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   that are ideal for you.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.960]   So it not only gives you information
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.580]   about where your health stands,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.880]   it gives you directives as to how to improve your health.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.440]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.220]   go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.740]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.760]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.240]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.880]   I spent a lifetime studying the visual system.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.360]   I can tell you that your visual system
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.700]   is incredibly sophisticated.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.380]   It allows you to do things like move
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.280]   from a shady area outside to a sunny area outside
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.200]   and to adjust your visual system
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.100]   so you don't even notice that transition.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.940]   A lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses are not designed
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.640]   with those sorts of biological transitions in mind.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.240]   Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses are different.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.120]   Every one of their glasses is designed
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.400]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.020]   First of all, they're incredibly lightweight
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.960]   so you don't even notice that they're on your face.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.200]   Second of all, they were designed to be worn
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.680]   during activities like running and cycling, et cetera,
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.240]   and they won't slip off your face even if you get sweaty,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.480]   and they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.920]   So even though they were originally designed
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.420]   as active eyewear, they look great.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.620]   So you can wear them out to dinner,
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.340]   to school, at work, et cetera.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.640]   If you'd like to try Roca sunglasses or eyeglasses,
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.360]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.220]   Okay, let's talk about heat.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.940]   More specifically, let's talk about the biology of heat
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.880]   and heating and the health benefits and tools
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.580]   related to heat and heating.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.440]   The first question that we have to answer is,
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.600]   how do we heat up?
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.840]   And the answer to that question is we heat up two ways.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.120]   We heat up from the outside,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.500]   meaning the things that we come into contact with,
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.940]   the clothing that we put on our body,
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.940]   whether or not there's heat in the room
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.940]   or whether or not it's cold outside or cold in a room,
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.700]   and we heat up from the inside.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.020]   Our body has the capacity to generate more heat
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.860]   or to cool down, meaning to turn off the heating process,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.500]   and it can do that in ways
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.460]   that match the external environment.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.040]   The simplest way to think about this
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.980]   is that we actually have two body temperatures.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.620]   People will say, oh, what's body temperature, 98.6.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.260]   That's actually not true.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.500]   Body temperature varies between individuals,
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.220]   it varies across time of day within individuals,
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.060]   and at every point across your entire lifespan,
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.780]   you have two distinct temperatures.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.900]   One is the temperature on your skin,
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.760]   what scientists call your shell,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.020]   and the temperature of your core, your viscera,
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.100]   meaning your organs, your nervous system,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.500]   and your spinal cord.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.980]   And as you can imagine, the temperature of your core
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.040]   is always higher than the temperature at your surface.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.100]   So the important thing to know
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.540]   is that you have a temperature at your shell
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.000]   and a temperature at your core.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.900]   Now, you don't need to know
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.300]   exactly what those temperatures are in most cases,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.180]   but it is vitally important to understand
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.900]   that you have those two temperatures
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.820]   and that your brain is constantly sending out signals
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.060]   to your body as to whether or not it should heat up
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.740]   or cool down depending on the temperature of the shell,
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.980]   which makes total sense.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.720]   This is a lot like a thermostat in a room,
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.600]   which is essentially paying attention
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.040]   to how cold or hot it is,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.640]   and then sending signals to the heating or cooling system
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.020]   to either heat up the environment
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.400]   or cool down the environment
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.560]   depending on the temperature in that environment.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.840]   Your brain has neurons that send signals
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.540]   to other cells in your body
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.140]   and deploy the release of chemicals in your brain and body
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.360]   to heat you up when you are too cold
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.140]   and to cool you down when you are too hot.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.740]   So if you can understand that you have two body temperatures,
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.120]   one at your shell, the surface,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.180]   and one at your core inside,
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.440]   and that your body and brain are always trying
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.640]   to balance those two temperatures in the appropriate way,
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.920]   well, then you're halfway there
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.660]   to understanding the biology of thermal regulation
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.800]   and heating, and you'll be a lot further along
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   in understanding how specific tools can be used
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.840]   to improve metabolism or improve cognition, for instance.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.360]   In fact, later you will learn that one way
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.520]   that you can heat up
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.800]   is by cooling down the surface of your body.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.700]   That's right.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.240]   If I were to throw a cold towel, ice cold towel
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.080]   onto your torso right now and ask you,
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.920]   well, how do you feel?
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.760]   You'd say, oh, that's cold, that's chilly.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.020]   However, because your brain is acting
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.200]   like a bit of a thermostat as the surface,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.080]   the shell of your body felt cool,
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.920]   it would make sense that that thermostat
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.760]   would activate biological mechanisms
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.380]   that would heat up your core.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.440]   Similarly, if I were to put you into a very hot environment,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.060]   you'd say, oh, wow, it's really, really warm in here,
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.920]   but your brain and your body would go through a lot of effort
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.760]   to activate mechanisms to cool you down.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.240]   So anytime we're talking about heat,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.160]   meaning deliberate heat exposure, things like sauna,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.800]   it's very important to understand not just the stimulus,
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.820]   how hot something is, how long you're in a sauna, et cetera,
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.560]   but the effect that has on your shell and on your core.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.160]   If you can understand that, you can design protocols
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.920]   that are literally perfect for your goals.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.600]   And as a final point about this,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.340]   if you want to develop the best tools,
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.480]   leveraging heat for your biology and health and performance,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.220]   you want to understand heat as a process, as a verb,
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.020]   as heating, not just heat,
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.000]   because there's the temperature that you are at
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.600]   before you encounter the heat stimulus,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.620]   before you get in the sauna, for instance,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.660]   during the heat stimulus, so while you're in the sauna,
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.420]   and then afterward.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.420]   Everything in biology is a process.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.420]   So as you'll soon learn,
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.140]   there is a specific sauna protocol that can allow you,
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.460]   can allow anybody in fact,
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.880]   to increase the amount of growth hormone released
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.020]   into their brain and body 16 fold.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.340]   That's right, 16 fold.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.220]   However, it involves shifting from a hot environment
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.300]   to a cool environment, to a hot environment,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.680]   to a cool environment over and over and over again,
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.640]   over a very short period of time,
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.160]   because it engages a switch, a process that compounds,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.560]   it builds on itself to increase growth hormone
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.760]   further and further.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.860]   In fact, if you were to just get into a sauna
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.000]   for a very long period of time and crank up the temperature
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.420]   to match the exact temperature that was used in that study,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.820]   you would not experience those increases in growth hormone.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.860]   It really is the transition between hot
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.680]   and cool temperatures that engage the process of heating
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.740]   and reheating over and over again.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.580]   So today you're going to learn about the use of sauna.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.940]   You're going to learn about the use
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.540]   of other heat related tools for health and optimization,
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.840]   not just for growth hormone, but also metabolic health,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.860]   for controlling cortisol,
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.080]   even to impact mental health in positive ways.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.340]   And in order to do that,
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.980]   you need to understand a little bit about the mechanisms
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.020]   of how you heat up and how you cool down,
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.540]   where the cells and circuits are in the brain and body,
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.280]   how those cells and circuits work.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.900]   I promise to make the description of that,
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.460]   which follows very clear,
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.060]   even if you don't have a background in biology.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.720]   And once you have that in hand,
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.220]   along with the understanding you now have
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.180]   about the fact that you got a shell and a core,
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.660]   and you need to think about both the shell and the core,
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.260]   well, then you will be in the best possible position
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.160]   to use sauna or hot tub or other tools,
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.260]   even just a hot shower as a powerful stimulus
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.920]   to optimize your biology.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.420]   Now, the science of heat and heating,
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.140]   and cold and cooling for that matter,
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.380]   goes back well over a hundred years.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.860]   In fact, it's kind of amusing to me
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.260]   that nowadays there's a kind of renewed interest
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.420]   in the use of heat and cold and the science of heat and cold
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.780]   because this was the first topic that I studied
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.020]   as an undergraduate.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.740]   And in fact, I did my graduate thesis on thermal regulation.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.680]   And at the time, thermal regulation
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.060]   wasn't really considered one of the hot topics
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.180]   in neuroscience.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.220]   People were more focused on things like memory
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.140]   and consciousness.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.880]   And of course those topics are still of vital interest
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.520]   to many people in many laboratories.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.380]   But thermal regulation was considered more,
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.140]   I think for the physiologists.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.900]   Nowadays, not just on social media,
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.880]   not just in the landscape of biohackers and athletes,
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.760]   but in the landscape of mental health,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   and frankly in the general ethos around health optimization,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.900]   people are really interested in heat and cold.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.100]   And the reason they're so interested in heat and cold
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.980]   is that a lot of the science has been done
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.660]   both in animal models in mice and in humans,
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.760]   and translates immediately to protocols that anyone can use.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.300]   Now, a brief warning now and another brief warning later,
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.060]   anytime you're talking about heating up your body,
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.540]   you need to be very cautious because unlike cooling down
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.380]   where you have a fairly broad range of cold temperatures
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.220]   that you can go into before it's damaging to tissue,
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.460]   well, you don't get to heat up the brain and body very much
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.780]   before you start getting into the realm of neuron damage.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.820]   And neurons in the central nervous system,
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.740]   the brain and spinal cord,
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.100]   once they're damaged, they don't come back.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.320]   So hyperthermia is a serious thing to avoid.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.960]   Later, I'll talk about ways to rapidly protect
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.980]   against hyperthermia.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.180]   But I do want to give everybody a cautionary note upfront.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.120]   Obviously, if you're pregnant, nursing,
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.360]   if you're very sensitive to hot environments,
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.920]   you want to stay out of saunas and things of that sort.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.340]   I'm sure there are exceptions to that.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.040]   You definitely have to talk to your doctor
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.680]   if you're going to violate that rule.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.240]   And for everybody, you want to approach any kind of tool
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.840]   related to heating very cautiously.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.440]   You always have the opportunity
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.640]   to increase the temperature later.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.500]   So proceed with caution, be smart about it.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.900]   I don't just say that to protect me.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.060]   I say that also to protect you.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.860]   So now let's talk about what are the circuits for heating up?
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.240]   How does that happen?
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.160]   Many of you have probably experienced a fever.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.340]   How does that happen?
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.140]   What happens when you go into a cold environment
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.940]   and you're shivering, but you put on a coat
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.820]   and then you feel warmer?
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.380]   What's really going on there?
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.100]   Well, there's a very basic circuit,
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.740]   meaning neurons that exist in the skin,
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.100]   in the brain and in the body
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.040]   that communicate with one another that allow you
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.900]   to heat up if you need to and cool down if you need to.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.820]   I'm going to throw a little bit of nomenclature,
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.180]   a few new words at you.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.420]   You don't need to memorize these words except for one.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.180]   Actually, you need to memorize one acronym,
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.940]   but it's very easy.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.060]   It's called the POA.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.380]   If you remember POA,
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.380]   you'll be home free for the rest of the episode.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.320]   But I know that there are some aficionados out there
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.980]   and people interested in getting
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.380]   a little bit deeper mechanism.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.300]   And I do think it's important to understand this circuit
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.900]   because once you understand this circuit
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.660]   and the way it's structured,
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.440]   then you are going to be in a great position
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.260]   to use the tools related to heating.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.540]   So here's how this circuit is structured.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.300]   You have this shell, which is basically skin.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.380]   And within the skin, you have neurons, nerve cells.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.420]   Those nerve cells have channels or receptors on them.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.620]   They're called trip channels.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.980]   There are some other ones as well,
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.260]   which basically sense changes in heat.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.100]   So if I were to put a hot object on your hand or your arm,
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.960]   or for instance, if I were to put a hot object
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.480]   on your hand or arm, and then remove that hot object,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.220]   those neurons would respond to that.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.780]   They would send electrical signals into your spinal cord.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.740]   And that's where the next station of this circuit resides.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.860]   In your spinal cord, you've got a little cluster of neurons
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.420]   that exists at the top part of your spinal cord
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.080]   called the dorsal horn.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.340]   The name again doesn't matter.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.580]   And those neurons specifically relay heat information
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.080]   up to another area of your brain.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.980]   Now here's where we get into some fancy names.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.320]   It's the lateral parabrachial area.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.360]   You don't need to know lateral parabrachial area,
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.780]   but it's a relay station.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.200]   The lateral parabrachial area sends electrical signals
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.460]   to the POA.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.940]   And I would like you to know POA.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.800]   The POA stands for preoptic area.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.940]   Neurons in the preoptic area basically reside
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.920]   over the roof of your mouth.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.620]   These are neurons within the hypothalamus.
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.140]   And neurons in the preoptic area have the ability
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.340]   to send signals out to the rest of your brain and body
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.500]   to get you to heat up and actually to change your behavior
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.180]   so that you heat up.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.540]   That's right.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.500]   If neurons in the preoptic area receive an electrical signal
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.900]   through the circuit I just described
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.780]   that goes from skin to dorsal horn of the spinal cord
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.620]   to lateral parabrachial,
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.340]   they will start sending signals out to the organs
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.400]   of your body and the tissues of your body
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.580]   to get those organs and tissues to do things.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.540]   And believe it or not, your POA, your preoptic area
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.740]   will actually change the way that you think
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.920]   and feel immediately.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.860]   For instance, if something warm contacts your skin
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.000]   or something very hot contacts your skin,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.660]   the preoptic area will send signals out
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.300]   to the endothelial cells, the blood vessels,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.820]   both of the brain and body that get them to dilate,
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.260]   to essentially increase their volume and their surface area
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.240]   in order to cast off heat.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.340]   You will also start sweating.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.340]   That sweating response is initiated not by the hot day
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.460]   or the hot sun, but by the preoptic area neurons
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.060]   that send signals out to what's called the periphery
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.580]   of your body and other chemicals are released,
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.540]   things like acetylcholine that get you to sweat.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.740]   And if you happen to be shivering,
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.300]   neurons in the preoptic area will make sure
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.900]   that you stop shivering.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.060]   You're probably familiar with the feeling
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.000]   of being somewhat lethargic or spreading out your limbs
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.100]   on a hot day.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.340]   Well, that is the result of neurons in your preoptic area
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.180]   impacting your musculature to get you
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.260]   to increase your surface area so you can sweat off
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.260]   or release more heat.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.860]   So there are all these different mechanisms
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.020]   by which we dump heat.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.120]   Some of those are purely physiological,
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.920]   below our conscious control, things like sweating,
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.240]   which you can't just make yourself sweat on demand.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.300]   Maybe you can through a set of stressful thoughts,
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.660]   but you can't just make yourself sweat.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.980]   That is autonomic, it's below your conscious control.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.980]   Things like vasodilation, the dilation of your veins
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.400]   in particular and capillaries in particular,
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.340]   these sorts of things.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.720]   And of course there are these behavioral,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.960]   somewhat voluntary aspects of dumping heat.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.820]   And the lethargy, the kind of tiredness that we feel
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.000]   on a really hot day, that's also controlled by this circuit
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.240]   that I just described.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.700]   In fact, I just got back from a visit to a very warm place
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.940]   and it was remarkable to me how lethargic I felt
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.780]   in the afternoons.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.680]   I just felt like a total slug.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.740]   I just could not move or rally to do anything,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.500]   except if I waited until the evening,
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.220]   even though it was later in the day,
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.980]   even though I hadn't napped,
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.080]   as the temperature in my environment cooled off,
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.700]   as my body temperature cooled off,
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.780]   I felt like I had more energy.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.860]   I was actually waking up,
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.900]   even though I had been awake for longer.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.380]   So the relationship between temperature and lethargy
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.560]   is a very intimate one.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.020]   If we're warm enough, we feel active
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.700]   and like we want to move around.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.660]   If we're too warm, we feel like we need to stay put
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.180]   and spread out our limbs and dump heat.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.580]   And that brings me to a quick and kind of fun point
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.660]   about how we dump heat versus how other animals dump heat.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.460]   Many of you know, of course, that we dump heat by sweating.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.940]   Other mechanisms as well, some of which I described,
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.380]   but that's our main way of dumping heat.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.340]   Other animals like dogs don't have the capacity to sweat,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.520]   at least not very much.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.740]   So they pant, right, in order to dump heat.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.020]   And still other animals like rodents,
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.120]   when they get too hot, they spit on their paws
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.000]   and they rub that spit on the surface of their body,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.120]   which might sound kind of gross
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.420]   and probably will get you to think twice
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.860]   before petting any of those animals
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.740]   or holding any of those animals again,
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.620]   unless that's your thing.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.140]   Now, one other key thing to understand about this circuit
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.860]   related to heat is that the preoptic area
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.100]   also can send electrical signals to the amygdala,
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.900]   a brain area that is often talked about
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.380]   in the context of fear, but is really just a brain area
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.020]   that can activate your sympathetic nervous system.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.820]   The sympathetic nervous system
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.060]   is part of your autonomic nervous system
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.300]   and is the one associated with fight or flight
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.100]   or with the stress response,
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.280]   or even just the excited response, right?
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.380]   The sympathetic nervous system is also what gets activated
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.140]   when you're really excited about something.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.980]   The preoptic area has the opportunity
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.740]   to trigger the activation of the amygdala.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.100]   Now, it doesn't do it every time, but it can.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.140]   And it tends to do that when you are suddenly
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.900]   in an environment that feels too hot,
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.040]   that you feel is risky levels of hot.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.260]   If you ever have gotten into a sauna that was very, very hot,
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.480]   maybe 210 degrees Fahrenheit, you sit there for a minute,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.520]   you'll notice that your heart rate increases
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.360]   and there are reasons for that.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.220]   And we'll talk about some of the health benefits of that.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.280]   in a few minutes, but it's pretty uncomfortable.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.620]   You may not feel like your skin is going to burn up,
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.600]   but you often will feel the impulse to get out,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.860]   especially if you stay in there for a little while.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.840]   That impulse is the consequence of this preoptic area
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.380]   communicating with your amygdala saying,
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.120]   "Hey, this environment is really hot
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.460]   and I'm trying to cool down and it's not really working.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.980]   I'm dumping heat, but I'm not able to adjust the core
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.240]   of my body temperature in ways
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.740]   that are going to protect my neurons."
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.300]   And so it's a signal that you probably shouldn't stay
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.820]   in that environment too long.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.300]   Now, later, we'll talk about the advantage
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.660]   of pushing yourself a little bit
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.540]   through some of these very hot environments,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.160]   provided you can do it safely.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.380]   But the impulse to get yourself
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.820]   out of a very hot environment is the consequence
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.660]   of the POA communicating with your amygdala.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.660]   And the amygdala then in turn activating your adrenal glands,
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.580]   which sit right above your kidneys,
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.460]   the release of adrenaline and this feeling of agitation
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.560]   like you want to move.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.320]   Usually you want to move out of whatever hot environment
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.440]   you happen to be in.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.840]   So now you know the circuit.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.680]   Again, it's simple.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.600]   It goes from skin to spinal cord,
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.580]   one brain area to another brain area.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.320]   That's the key one in this discussion,
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.360]   which is the POA, the preoptic area.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.240]   And the preoptic area can kick off
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.580]   a bunch of autonomic subconscious responses to heat,
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.020]   which make us attempt to get cooler,
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.340]   things like sweating, vasodilation, et cetera.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.140]   And it can kick off behavioral responses,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.640]   spreading out our limbs in an attempt to dump even more heat,
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.980]   feeling lethargic, so a lack of desire to run and move.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.540]   And it also has the opportunity to kick off a mild
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.480]   or maybe not so mild panic response
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.500]   to get us out of that hot environment.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.300]   If you can conceptualize that circuit,
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.680]   or if you can even just understand what I just said,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.700]   even at a top contour level,
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.880]   you're going to be in a great position to understand
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.460]   the rest of the information and the tools that follow.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.300]   Next, I'd like to talk about the use
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.000]   of deliberate heat exposure, including sauna,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.140]   but other tools as well as a way to understand
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.720]   how heat and heating changes our biology.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.380]   So you're going to learn some mechanism
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.080]   and you're going to learn some tools.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.140]   But first I'd like to just emphasize
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.660]   that the use of deliberate heat exposure
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:55.100]   can be a very powerful way to improve health and longevity.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.120]   There's a wonderful study on this that was published in 2018
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.300]   that includes a lot of data from a lot of participants
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.000]   in a lot of different conditions.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.960]   For instance, people that only did sauna once
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.420]   versus two to three times a week
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.900]   versus four to seven times a week
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.140]   and so on and compares all those.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.360]   The title of the study is sauna bathing is associated
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.520]   with reduced cardiovascular mortality
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.620]   and improves risk prediction in men and women,
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.060]   a prospective cohort study.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.140]   This is one of several papers that clearly demonstrate
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.140]   that regular use of sauna
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.060]   or other forms of deliberate heat exposure
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.000]   can reduce mortality to cardiovascular events,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.880]   but also to other events,
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.260]   things like stroke and other things
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.800]   that basically can kill us.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.220]   What I like so much about this and the related studies,
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.340]   and yes, I will provide a link to these in the show notes,
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.600]   is that they involve a lot of participants.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.200]   So for instance, in this particular paper,
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.120]   which was published in BMC medicine,
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:58.280]   they looked at a sample of 1,688 participants
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.240]   who had a mean age of 63,
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.360]   but there was a range of ages around 63
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.220]   and of whom 51.4% were women, the rest were men.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.220]   So it's a pretty nicely varied study
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.160]   in terms of the populations that they looked at.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.260]   And basically what they found was the more often
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.960]   that people do sauna, the better their health is
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.060]   and the lower the likelihood they will die
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.320]   from some sort of cardiovascular event.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.760]   Now, what do we mean by sauna?
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.660]   We need to define some of the parameters around sauna
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.140]   and I promise to provide you some alternative ways
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.100]   to access some of the health benefits
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.580]   that were observed in this and related studies
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.220]   without the need to have a sauna,
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.960]   'cause I do realize that a lot of people
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.180]   don't have access to sauna.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.460]   First off, the temperature ranges that were used
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.760]   in this study and pretty much all the studies
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.860]   that I'm going to talk about, unless I say otherwise,
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.940]   are between 80 degrees Celsius,
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.940]   meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit and 100 degrees Celsius,
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.260]   meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.260]   So somewhere in that range,
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.200]   how hot should you make the sauna
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.780]   or the environment that you get into
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.860]   should you decide to use these tools?
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.420]   Well, that will depend on your tolerance for heat,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.100]   how heat adapted you are.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.500]   Yes, some people are better at sweating than others
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.580]   and over time, we all get better at sweating.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.440]   Meaning if you go into the sauna more frequently,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.740]   you become a better sweater.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.260]   Not a sweater you wear, but the verb, sweater.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.500]   You get better at sweating,
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.720]   at dumping heat through the loss of water.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.900]   So it's going to depend.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.980]   I recommend starting on the lower end
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.280]   of the temperature scale.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.640]   And if that's too hot for you,
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.620]   that you even lower the temperature further.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.340]   Now, how long were people exposing themselves
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.640]   to these hot environments?
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.300]   Anywhere from five to 20 minutes per session.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.700]   And as you'll soon learn,
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.740]   very brief periods of just five minutes of heat exposure
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.580]   can be a powerful stimulus
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.580]   if the heat exposure is significantly great enough for you.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.220]   20 minutes can also be beneficial,
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.500]   but 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.260]   meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.580]   is the general range that this and most studies use.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.540]   In this particular study,
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.300]   they compared the effects of people that did sauna
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.220]   once a week, two or three times per week,
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.980]   or four to seven times per week.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.380]   And what they saw was really remarkable.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.100]   What they observed was that people who went into the sauna
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.020]   two or three times per week,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.540]   were 27% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.900]   than people that went into the sauna just once a week.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.180]   Again, at the temperature levels
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.540]   and the duration that I talked about earlier.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.500]   And as you can imagine,
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.780]   the duration and the temperature levels were related.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.980]   So if people went into very hot environments
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.180]   that were really uncomfortable for them,
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.840]   maybe they only went in for five minutes.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.940]   Whereas if they were more comfortable and heat adapted
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.260]   in a given environment or their tolerance for heat
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.580]   was just simply higher for whatever reason,
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.720]   well, then they tended to stay in longer.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.540]   We can take a sort of average of this five
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.600]   to 20 minute range.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.360]   And today we're mainly going to talk about exposures
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.460]   between 10 and 20 minutes at temperatures between,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.520]   again, 80 degrees and 100 degrees Celsius,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.120]   176 degrees Fahrenheit or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.420]   So these data point to the fact that going in the sauna
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.240]   two or three times per week is really beneficial
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.620]   and can lower mortality to cardiovascular events.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.220]   And in fact, the benefits were even greater
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.660]   for people that were going into the sauna
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.660]   four to seven times per week.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.700]   Those people were 50% less likely to die
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.900]   of a cardiovascular event compared to people
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.400]   that went into the sauna just once a week.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.820]   So these are really impressive
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.220]   and frankly encouraging studies.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.260]   Certainly they caught my eye and encouraged me
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.660]   to start using deliberate heat exposure on a regular basis.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.500]   What's particularly nice about this study
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.660]   and the related study that again is linked in the show notes
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.480]   is that they looked at a number
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.620]   of potentially confounding variables,
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.480]   things like whether or not people smoked,
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.180]   things like whether or not people were overweight,
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.400]   whether or not they tended to exercise or not exercise,
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.060]   and they were able to separate out those variables.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.100]   So the percentages that I described earlier,
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.260]   27% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.560]   for those that went in the sauna two to three times a week
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.820]   and 50% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.060]   for those that went into the sauna four times per week
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.940]   as compared to just once a week.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.020]   Those effects really do seem to be the consequence
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.020]   of the sauna exposure and not some other effect
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.740]   that's correlated with sauna exposure,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.780]   like going to the gym where people are working out
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.240]   seven times a week and then also happen to get into the sauna
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.180]   or quitting smoking right about the same time
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.320]   they adopt a sauna protocol, these sorts of things.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.480]   And now there have been additional analysis
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.700]   of the use of sauna for improving health,
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.980]   or I should say for offsetting mortality
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.660]   that have found that it's not just reductions
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.820]   in cardiovascular events,
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.220]   but so-called all-cause mortality.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.420]   This is kind of medical geek speak.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.580]   We're saying, how likely are you or somebody
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.980]   to die from a cardiovascular event,
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.880]   but maybe also from some other event,
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.260]   some other health-related event,
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.340]   like cancer or something of that sort.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.380]   And in every case, regular exposure to sauna,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.760]   starting at about two or three times per week,
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.500]   all the way up to seven times per week greatly improves,
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.020]   meaning statistically significant improvements in longevity
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.460]   in the sense that people are less likely to die
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.320]   of cardiovascular events and other things that kill us.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.280]   So I and many other people who are interested,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.380]   not just in our own health,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.340]   but in educating about health-related tools
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.460]   to the general public find this really exciting.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.400]   But knowing what we know about how heat impacts our biology,
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.860]   it probably shouldn't surprise us
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.980]   that this sauna type exposure or deliberate heat exposure
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.620]   has these incredible effects.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.020]   So before we get into the biological mechanisms
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.660]   of how heat can have all these impressive health effects,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.900]   I want to just talk about the use of sauna as a tool
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.220]   and emphasize that you don't have to use a sauna
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.060]   in order to get these benefits.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.620]   It is simply a matter of making sure
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.620]   that your shell and your core heat up properly a bit,
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.660]   not too much, not too little, but that you heat those up.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.560]   And no, you do not need to carry a thermometer around
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.360]   or place a thermometer into your core.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.040]   You know, in laboratory studies and in humans,
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.080]   if you really want to know someone's core temperature,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.720]   basically you try and put the thermal probe
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.880]   as close to the core as you can.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.000]   So typically that's done rectally or a mouth thermometer,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.440]   or even up the nose.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.180]   You don't need to do any of that, all right?
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.280]   This isn't a laboratory study.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.660]   There are ways to create a hot environment
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:41.020]   such that you heat up your shell and your core safely
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.160]   without having to measure your core temperature all along.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.820]   If you want to do that, be my guest,
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.160]   but I'm not going to provide a protocol.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.600]   So the question is, how are you heating up your environment?
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.340]   And I realized that there are dry saunas,
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.660]   there are steam saunas, there are infrared saunas,
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.200]   there are hot tubs, and there are simply rooms
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.980]   that you crank up the heat, okay?
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.720]   There are also ways in which you can increase your shell
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.360]   and your core temperature by moving around a lot
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.480]   and doing that wearing a lot of clothing.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:16.060]   There's nothing special about any one of these approaches
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.060]   or protocols.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.420]   It's just so happens that sauna
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.620]   is one of the more convenient ways to do this.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.300]   And certainly for the studies that I've talked about,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.740]   not just the ones I referenced before,
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.540]   but all the studies that I researched
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.080]   looking at this episode,
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.740]   it makes sense why they would use sauna
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.820]   because it's very hard, for instance,
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:37.060]   to create conditions where you have five people go out
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.860]   jogging, wearing heavy sweaters and hats, wool hats
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.020]   on the middle of summer.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.800]   It's very hard to set up those conditions
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.440]   in a way that's controlled for everybody.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.500]   Whereas it's pretty straightforward to have a sauna
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.060]   where you have one or several people
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.200]   just get into that one uniformly hot environment.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.860]   That's a much easier study to run.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.260]   So just to be clear, the temperature range is important.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.620]   You want to get between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.880]   Now you know the conversion to Fahrenheit.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.900]   You could however, immerse yourself in a hot tub
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.860]   or hot water bath up to your neck.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.620]   That's another way to approach it.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.900]   If you didn't have access to either of those,
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.900]   you could also put on a hoodie or a wool hat and a hoodie,
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.400]   or you could do like the wrestlers do.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.140]   And you could actually buy one of these plastic suits.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.060]   They're literally called plastics that wrestlers
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.420]   or other athletes that wish to drop water weight will wear
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.540]   and then go jogging that.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.080]   All of those will increase your shell
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.500]   and your core body temperature, right?
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.600]   Especially if you do it on a hot day,
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.580]   but of course be careful, hydrate and don't overheat,
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.500]   don't become excessively hyperthermic
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.220]   'cause you can get heat stroke and you can potentially die.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.820]   But if you're going to use sauna,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.220]   often I get the question, how hot should the sauna be?
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.060]   Well, now you know.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.920]   How long should you be in there?
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.240]   Five to 20 minutes per session.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.780]   Although I will talk in a minute
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.860]   about ways to optimize hormone output,
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.180]   in particular growth hormone output
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.660]   by doing four very brief sessions.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.040]   So maybe not a continuous session.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.260]   We'll get into that in a few minutes.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.020]   And of course you have to ask yourself wet sauna, dry sauna.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.860]   You know what?
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.140]   Doesn't matter, use what you prefer.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.220]   Many people ask me, well, what about infrared sauna?
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.460]   We have an entire episode all about the use of light
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.660]   and low level light therapy, including infrared light.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.860]   It does have certain benefits for skin
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.780]   and other organs and tissues of the body if used properly.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.300]   My understanding, or at least my assessment
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.500]   of most infrared saunas out there
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.660]   is that they don't get hot enough.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.500]   They don't get up to that 80 to 100 degrees Celsius range.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.700]   Some do, most don't.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.580]   So what you end up with is a situation
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.860]   where you've got a red light,
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.100]   low level light therapy stimulus,
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.900]   and you've got a sauna that's not quite hot enough.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.560]   And there are a lot of ideas and claims
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.440]   about how they work together
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   in order to get you improved benefits.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.100]   I personally am of the stance based on the literature
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.440]   that I've read that you want to get into those ranges
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.260]   of an 80 to 100 degrees Celsius before you start,
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.020]   considering whether or not you're also going to include
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.680]   red light therapies, et cetera.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.620]   So there's nothing special about red light sauna.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.120]   It's really the temperature of the sauna
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.220]   that you happen to get into.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.800]   So which tool, right?
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.040]   Which sauna, which stimulus do you run in wearing plastics
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.340]   and a hoodie and a wool hat?
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.180]   When you get into a sauna,
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.160]   that's going to depend a lot on your circumstances,
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.860]   your budget, and what you have access to on a regular basis.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.300]   This is a lot like our discussion about the use of cold.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.880]   Most of the studies have looked at immersion in cold water
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.040]   up to the neck because that's a very controlled situation
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.620]   that you can do in a laboratory.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.740]   They have not explored cold showers as much.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.740]   So there's just less data
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.620]   or walking around in a cold environment.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.240]   But we'll talk a little bit about those data
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.320]   because as you'll soon learn, when you talk about cold,
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.600]   you're actually talking about heating as well.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.220]   So what kind of mechanisms are activated in your brain
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:54.040]   and body that allow for the various health benefits of sauna
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.320]   or other forms of deliberate heating?
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.280]   Well, we talked about reduced risk
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.400]   of cardiovascular event-related mortality
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.340]   and all-cause mortality.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:08.240]   As you'll soon learn, there are also tremendous benefits
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.440]   in terms of increases in growth hormone,
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.360]   reductions in cortisol, et cetera.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.640]   I will detail those.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.360]   So what happens when you get into a hot environment?
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.720]   What are the mechanisms that allow
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.080]   for the various health effects of that?
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.000]   Well, your shell, your skin senses that,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.200]   and through the circuit that I described earlier,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.260]   activates neurons in the POA, the pre-optic area,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.400]   which in turn activates mechanisms
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.100]   in your autonomic nervous system like vasodilation.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.600]   So blood flow increases,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.240]   plasma volume of your blood increases, and stroke volume.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.560]   The volume of blood that is mobilized
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.120]   with each beat of your heart also increases
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:51.080]   and your heart rate increases to anywhere between 100
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.980]   to 150 beats per minute.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.460]   That general constellation of effects looks a lot
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.680]   like cardiovascular exercise.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.520]   And in fact, for all intents and purposes,
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.940]   it really is cardiovascular exercise,
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.560]   except that there isn't the mobilization
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   and the loading of joints and limbs and things of that sort.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.200]   And of course, there are additional benefits
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   of cardiovascular exercise that relate to impact
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.440]   on the ground, improvements in bone density,
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.800]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.640]   But basically your heart starts beating,
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.960]   more blood starts circulating,
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.980]   your vasculature changes shape literally
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.760]   to accommodate those increases
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.420]   in heart rate and blood volume.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.980]   And you're basically getting a cardiovascular workout
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.540]   in that hot environment, even if you're just sitting down.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.400]   Another set of positive effects related
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.020]   to being in these hot environments are hormone effects.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.980]   Shifts in the output of hormones,
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.520]   both from your adrenals and possibly from the testes
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.880]   and ovaries, and even within the brain.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   One of the more striking examples of that comes
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.640]   from a study that was published in 2021.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.120]   The title of the study is endocrine effects
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.640]   of repeated hot thermal stress
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   and cold water immersion in young adult men.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.280]   And indeed the study was in this case, just done on men.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.160]   I'll just briefly describe the protocol they use.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.760]   They had these men attend four sauna sessions
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.400]   of 12 minutes each.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.320]   So again, well within that range of five to 12 minutes.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.040]   The temperature of those saunas was 90
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.460]   to 91 degrees Celsius.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.120]   So I'll just quickly do the calculation,
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.260]   admittedly not in my head.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.000]   That's 194 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.140]   And they did that four times.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.820]   Afterwards, they had a six minute cool down break
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.600]   during which they did get into some cool water
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.160]   or cold water of about 10 degrees,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:43.880]   which is 10 degrees Celsius is 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.040]   And then they measured hormones at various times
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.800]   throughout this study, before, during, and after.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.080]   They looked at testosterone.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.980]   They looked at DHEA, which is in the androgen pathway.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:57.120]   They looked at prolactin and they looked at cortisol.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.160]   The significant effects of the protocol
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.000]   that I just described were on cortisol,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.840]   a so-called stress hormone, so-called,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.240]   because when we are very stressed for long periods of time,
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.740]   cortisol levels tend to increase dramatically.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:14.440]   But I should point out that a increase in cortisol each day,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.800]   right about the time of waking,
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.600]   and specifically right about the time of waking
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.920]   is actually beneficial for our alertness and our energy.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.280]   So having some increase in cortisol every 24 hours
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.460]   is a good thing provided it happens early in the day.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.480]   Late day increases in cortisol
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.280]   are associated with depression.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.480]   That's been shown by studies at Stanford and elsewhere.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.720]   The major effect of this study
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.960]   is a significant decrease in cortisol output
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.980]   in these subjects.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.780]   I think this is really interesting and important
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.260]   because many people suffer from acute,
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.320]   meaning immediate and long-term stress,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.160]   and are looking for ways to control their stress.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.540]   Controlling your cortisol is tricky.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.760]   In the episode on stress,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.800]   I talked about supplements such as ashwagandha
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.880]   that can be used to limit cortisol,
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.120]   but you have to be careful not to use ashwagandha
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.880]   for extended periods of time,
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.320]   meaning for longer than two weeks,
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.360]   because you can get into other issues.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.000]   I talk about breathwork protocols
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.880]   that can allow you to clamp or reduce the stress response
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.960]   in real time.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.580]   Again, see that episode for those,
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.560]   but many people are overworked, they're overstressed.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.640]   They're, for one reason or another,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.280]   they're subjected to many, too many stressors
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.400]   or their level of stress resilience isn't high enough
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.440]   to keep their cortisol levels clamped at a healthy level.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.000]   So the protocol I described of 12 minute exposures
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.160]   to 90 degree environment, that's again, 90 degrees Celsius,
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.320]   followed by a six minute cool down break in cool water,
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.280]   50 degrees or so, that's pretty cold.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.560]   I can imagine that you could also just take a cool shower
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.980]   or a cold shower afterwards.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.080]   That had a very significant effect on lowering cortisol.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.580]   So there you have a tool,
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.160]   it's not a completely zero cost tool
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.200]   'cause you need to heat the water,
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.000]   you need to have access to hot and cold water,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.800]   at least hot and cold contrast of some sort,
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.080]   but it's fairly minimal cost for most people,
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.680]   especially if you start getting creative
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.140]   about maybe taking a 12 minute jog,
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.360]   wearing a lot of clothing,
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.640]   if it's hot out, then getting into a cool shower,
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.200]   you might not get the same extreme
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.960]   or significant reduction in cortisol
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.440]   that was observed here with these very specific protocols,
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.720]   but it's likely that you would get
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.000]   a similar result overall.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.300]   Now, I mentioned they did look at these other hormones
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.180]   and I'll just tell you that they did not see
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.400]   significant shifts in testosterone, prolactin,
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.200]   DHEA, et cetera, using this protocol.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.240]   As you'll soon see, there are other sauna protocols
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.220]   that can impact those other hormones.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.600]   So if you're seeking to use sauna to reduce stress,
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.720]   I think this is a very interesting
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.280]   and potentially useful research-backed protocol.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.940]   And again, we will provide a link to the paper
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.420]   if you'd like to read more about the data.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.940]   So that is one set of biological effects on cortisol
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.540]   and the related protocol.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.640]   What about some of the other benefits of sauna?
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.700]   Well, we'll talk about those,
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.200]   but I want to talk about those
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.120]   in the context of the underlying mechanisms,
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   because if you understand those underlying mechanisms,
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.800]   you can really tailor your sauna protocols
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.600]   for your particular needs.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.860]   One of the more dramatic and important effects
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:09.160]   of going into a hot environment for some period of time
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.280]   is the activation of so-called heat shock proteins, or HSPs.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.800]   Heat shock proteins are a protective mechanism
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   in your brain and body to rescue proteins
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.780]   that would otherwise misfold.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.620]   Now, what do I mean by this?
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.560]   Well, most of you are familiar with the fact
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.140]   that if you have protein in the kitchen, like a steak
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.920]   or a piece of chicken or a piece of fish,
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.680]   and you heat it up, it changes its texture, right?
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.040]   Raw meat is different than cooked meat,
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.660]   to be quite blunt about it.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:42.600]   Heat changes the quality of proteins,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.880]   not just in terms of how they taste,
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.600]   but the way in which they are configured.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.000]   It changes it right down at the molecular level.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.500]   When your body goes through changes in temperature each day,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.700]   and we'll talk about those changes,
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.920]   but in response to hot environments or cold environments,
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.740]   heat shock proteins are deployed to go and rescue
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.080]   and prevent the changes in proteins
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.260]   that would be detrimental to your health.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.120]   So at least in the short term,
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.200]   activating heat shock proteins is a good thing.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.220]   You don't want heat shock proteins to be activated
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.460]   for long periods of time,
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.240]   because that gets to be problematic for other reasons.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.640]   But these heat shock proteins,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.220]   of which there are many varieties,
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.460]   basically have the job of traveling in your brain and body
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:27.060]   and making sure that cells that contain proteins
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.860]   that are misfolding because they got heated up too much,
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.320]   don't misfold.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.020]   And they also serve a protective mechanism,
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.360]   making sure that proteins within the cells
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.280]   of your brain and body don't fold in the wrong ways.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.480]   Again, I'm describing this in very general terms,
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.440]   but it's well-established in animal models and in humans
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.700]   that sauna exposure of the sort that I described earlier
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.740]   activates these heat shock proteins.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.700]   There are some interesting studies that were carried out
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.340]   in animal models that really nicely mechanistically support
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.420]   the role of heat shock proteins in some of the benefits
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.320]   of deliberate heat exposure.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.940]   Some of these studies were done in flies,
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.320]   meaning drosophila, fruit flies,
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.100]   'cause they're a great model organism
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.340]   because you can delete genes or add genes easily.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.620]   Other studies have been done in mice.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.380]   And now there are also studies being carried out in humans.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.640]   And I will talk about those.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.900]   One of the more dramatic examples that's always touted
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.220]   in this field of deliberate heat exposure
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.660]   as it relates to longevity is that if they expose
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.200]   these flies, these fruit flies to 70 minutes
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.400]   of a heat stimulus that obviously didn't kill them,
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.240]   but activated heat shock proteins,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.980]   it could extend their life by 15%
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.940]   in a heat shock dependent way.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.700]   Meaning if they made flies that didn't have
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.300]   these heat shock proteins,
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.340]   well then they didn't see this extension in life.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.260]   And this is one of the reasons to use model organisms.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.940]   This is not an experiment that you could do in people.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.740]   However, there have been interesting studies done in humans
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.460]   examining some of the downstream molecular pathways
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.660]   of deliberate heat exposure that point to the mechanisms
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.460]   by which deliberate heat exposure can help protect
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.300]   against different forms of mortality,
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.960]   improve health overall, and possibly,
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.720]   and I want to highlight possibly, possibly extend life.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.300]   One such mechanism involves a genetic program involving
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.020]   a molecule called FOXO3.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.100]   FOXO3 is a very interesting molecule
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.720]   because it's involved in DNA repair pathways.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:32.620]   DNA repair is part of the process of remaining healthy.
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.660]   We'd all like to think that we're born
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.780]   and based on the genes we have,
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.400]   we are healthy, healthy, healthy,
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.860]   then eventually we age and then we die.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.100]   But from the time we're born until the time we die,
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.960]   there's a constant repair of our proteins and our cells
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.960]   and a modification of the genes that are being expressed.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.160]   Puberty being the most dramatic example, right?
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.520]   You see a kid before puberty and after puberty,
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.000]   looks like a different kid, sounds like a different kid,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.440]   thinks like a different kid, in fact,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.480]   basically is a different human being, right?
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.520]   It's not just the hormones,
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.780]   it's that hormones themselves have the capacity to turn on
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.120]   and turn off certain genes,
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.440]   literally converting certain tissues and cells
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.920]   in the brain and body to do entirely different things.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.820]   So it's not just the sprouting of new aspects
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.640]   of our biology, it's literally the conversion
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.100]   of different brain centers from one function to another.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:24.080]   That's puberty, and we'll do a whole episode about puberty.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.000]   We actually did an episode on sexual development
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.040]   that talks a little bit about those mechanisms,
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.280]   but the point is that throughout our entire lifespan,
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.900]   genes are being turned on, genes are being turned off,
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.600]   genes are being turned on, genes are being turned off,
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   and DNA, the stuff of genes, gets damaged in that process.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.600]   FOXO3 sits upstream in a pathway
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.080]   related to DNA repair,
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.500]   and again, clearing of these senescent cells.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.120]   Sauna exposure, in particular,
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.280]   sauna exposure two to three times,
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.700]   or ideally four to seven times per week,
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.360]   in that 80 to 100 degree Celsius range
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.960]   has been shown to upregulate levels of FOXO3.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.360]   FOXO3, in turn, upregulates pathways related to DNA repair
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.780]   and clearing out of these senescent or dead cells,
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.380]   which is known to be important for various aspects
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.500]   of maintaining cognition
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.400]   and other aspects of maintaining health.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.460]   So these are the likely biological mechanisms
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.420]   for the improvements in lifespan,
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.180]   or rather, I should say,
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.920]   these are the biological mechanisms
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.160]   that apparently offset some of the cardiovascular risk
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.680]   and other forms of mortality that were described earlier.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.180]   One especially interesting thing about FOXO3,
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.380]   there are individuals out there
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:47.680]   that have either additional copies of FOXO3
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.360]   or who have versions of FOXO3 that are hyperactive,
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.920]   so to speak.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:58.640]   Those people tend to be 2.7 times more likely
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.800]   to live to 100 years of age or longer.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.600]   So these are people that were just naturally,
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.040]   and fortunately for them,
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.520]   endowed with more FOXO3, more clearance of senescent cells,
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.420]   more DNA repair, et cetera.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.120]   For the rest of us, at least to my knowledge,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.200]   I don't have one of these
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.920]   health-promoting FOXO3 mutations.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.680]   Remember, mutations can be beneficial
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.660]   or they can be detrimental.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.180]   This, if your goal is to live longer,
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.000]   is a beneficial mutation.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.480]   Well, if you don't have these FOXO3 mutations
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.580]   that allow you to be a centenarian
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.040]   at 2.7 times higher likelihood than other people,
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.840]   deliberate heat exposure is one way
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.520]   that you can increase FOXO3 activity.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.940]   At this point in time,
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.960]   meaning when looking at the research out there,
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.800]   it isn't clear what the optimal Sauna protocol
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.360]   is going to be specifically to increase FOXO3,
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.320]   and that's probably because there isn't one.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.600]   There is no Sauna protocol designed specifically
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.840]   to reduce cortisol or specifically to increase FOXO3
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.760]   or specifically to activate heat shock proteins.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.080]   Any deliberate heat exposure
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.040]   is likely to impact all of those mechanisms.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.960]   Again, I encourage you to use this guide
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.940]   of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius as your kind of bookends
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.240]   for what you can tolerate and where you want to start
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.140]   and eventually transition to
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.840]   in terms of deliberate heat exposure.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.460]   And I would encourage you to use that five to 20 minutes
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:27.900]   per session for the Sauna as your rough guide
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.700]   of how long to remain in the Sauna.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.160]   Now, there was a study published just this last year
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.860]   that was mainly focused on deliberate cold exposure.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.980]   I detailed this quite extensively in the episode on cold.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.040]   This is the beautiful work of Susanna Soberg.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.940]   And that study looked at deliberate cold exposure,
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.840]   but also Sauna exposure.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.860]   And that study found that 57, yes,
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.740]   57 minutes per week of Sauna exposure
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:57.080]   in conjunction with 11 minutes per week,
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:01.760]   total of deliberate cold exposure was the threshold
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.720]   for getting improvements in metabolism
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.840]   and increases in brown fat.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.760]   This very active fat tissue
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.160]   that improves mitochondrial function and thermogenesis,
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.000]   meaning heating of the body.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.860]   We'll talk more about the brown fat later.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.740]   Why do I mention this?
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.580]   Well, for those of you that are interested
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.500]   in increasing metabolism,
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.120]   it does seem to be most beneficial
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.840]   to do that 11 minutes per week of cold exposure.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.220]   Again, divided up across two or more sessions.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.860]   So it's not 11 minutes all at once, but shorter sessions.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.700]   And to get 57 minutes minimum per week of Sauna exposure,
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.460]   again, in the temperature ranges that I've talked about here.
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:42.240]   And again, it's not 57 minutes in the Sauna all at once.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.420]   That's 57 minutes total per week as the minimum threshold.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.720]   So you might divide that into three sessions of 20 minutes.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.340]   And again, I don't think 57 is the magic number.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.240]   It could be 60, it could be 64, it probably could be 55.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.380]   Remember your biological systems are not counting things off
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.580]   minute by minute, second by second,
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.900]   at least not in most cases.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.180]   So for those of you that are interested
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:07.080]   in improving metabolism, check out the episode on cold,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.980]   or just take the SOBERG protocol, as I call it,
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:15.140]   which is 11 minutes total per week of uncomfortably cold,
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.820]   but safe cold exposure.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.420]   So uncomfortably cold means you really,
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.340]   really want to get out of the shower or the ice bath
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.140]   or whatever environment, but you can stay in.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.740]   11 minutes total per week divided across a couple of sessions
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:29.660]   and then 57 minutes per week or so
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.980]   of deliberate heat exposure.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.980]   Again, uncomfortably hot, excuse me, but safe to stay in,
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.780]   probably divided up across three or more sessions.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.700]   Okay, so we've talked about the use of sauna
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.580]   to decrease cortisol.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.620]   We've talked about the use of sauna
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.120]   to increase heat shock proteins.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:51.340]   We've talked about the use of sauna to increase FOXO3.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.180]   Now I'd like to talk about the use of sauna
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.460]   to increase growth hormone.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.520]   Growth hormone is a hormone that we all naturally secrete
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.780]   from our pituitary,
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.780]   which also resides near the roof of our mouth.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.540]   The signal for the pituitary to release growth hormone
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.440]   arrives from neurons that exist in the hypothalamus.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.940]   So growth hormone releasing hormones, believe it or not,
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:14.820]   that's what they're called,
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.220]   stimulate the release of growth hormone
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.680]   from the anterior pituitary gland
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.180]   into the general circulation.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.740]   And then growth hormone impacts metabolism
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.540]   and growth of cells and tissues of the body.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.520]   It is responsible for tissue repair as well.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.180]   And the growth spurt that everyone experiences
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.520]   during puberty is the consequence of growth hormone.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.520]   What I'm about to describe is a study that found dramatic,
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.180]   really dramatic, I should say, increases in growth hormone.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.620]   But I also want to emphasize
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.360]   that these increases in growth hormone
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.800]   were not of the sort that are observed in puberty
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.700]   or in infants becoming adolescents or adolescents
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.000]   growing into teenagers.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.420]   Those levels of growth hormone
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.400]   that are associated with those massive transformations,
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.760]   excuse me, of body morphology, of shape,
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.260]   are far greater than the sorts that I'm talking about here.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:10.100]   And yet, as all of us age,
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.060]   when we go from adolescence to our teenage years
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.500]   and then into young adulthood,
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.360]   but then starting in our early thirties or so,
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.320]   the amount of growth hormone that we secrete
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.640]   is greatly diminished.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.760]   Normally, we would release growth hormone every night
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.620]   after we go to sleep,
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.620]   in particular in the early part of the night
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.560]   when our sleep is comprised mostly of slow wave sleep.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.420]   As we age, less growth hormone is released
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.460]   during that slow wave sleep.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.580]   There are various things
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.860]   that can promote the release of growth hormone.
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.080]   And we will talk about some of those other things
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:42.920]   in a moment.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.520]   Things like low blood sugar, turns out,
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:50.440]   is a stimulus for growth hormone release.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.680]   And I don't mean hypoglycemia of the sort
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.700]   that makes you dizzy and want to pass out, that's bad.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.480]   I mean, not having high levels of glucose and insulin
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.320]   in your bloodstream.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.300]   This is one of the reasons why many people
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:04.400]   are drawn to intermittent fasting or even prolonged fasting.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.420]   It's because of the reported increases in growth hormone.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.660]   I'll touch on those briefly,
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.060]   but if you want to learn more about those
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.220]   and what their real impact is
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.920]   and the extent of growth hormone,
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.140]   check out the episode I did on fasting.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.280]   You can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.400]   Certain forms of exercise have also been shown
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.440]   to stimulate growth hormone release.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.700]   And in a few moments, I'll talk about
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.780]   how exercise and fasting can be combined
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.960]   or how heat can be combined with exercise
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.260]   or certain patterns of food intake
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.580]   to further increase growth hormone.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:35.040]   But before I do that, I want to review some of the data
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:38.600]   and one study in particular that discovered
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.440]   certain forms of deliberate heat exposure using sauna
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.400]   can stimulate very large increases in growth hormone output,
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.380]   which for people in their 30s, 40s and beyond
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.340]   could be very useful and may also be useful
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.100]   for people who are just trying to stimulate
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.680]   the release of more growth hormone
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.860]   in order to, for instance, recover from exercise
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.840]   or stimulate fat loss or muscle growth
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.500]   or repair of a particular injury.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.860]   The title of this paper is endocrine effects
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:04.600]   of repeated sauna bathing.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.340]   And this is a paper that was published in 1986,
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.960]   which is some years ago, but nonetheless serves as a basis
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.560]   for a lot of other studies that followed.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.340]   So let me describe what they did in this study.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.420]   They used an 80 degree Celsius environment.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.620]   So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:25.860]   And they had subjects do this sauna for 30 minutes,
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.560]   four times per day.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.820]   So that's two hours total in one day,
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.460]   30 minutes in the sauna, a period of cool down rest,
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.500]   30 minutes in the sauna again, cool down rest,
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.940]   a third and a fourth time, okay?
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:41.020]   So two hours total in this 80 degree Celsius environment.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:42.180]   So that's a lot,
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:45.500]   but what they observed was really quite significant.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.460]   So they had subjects do this protocol.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.200]   And I should mention they had both male and female subjects
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.580]   in the study and the entire study lasted a week.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.420]   They did this two hours of sauna exposure on day one,
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.600]   day three and day seven of that week.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.300]   And they measured a lot of different hormones, cortisol,
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:07.200]   thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself,
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.320]   luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone,
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.120]   which are hormones that essentially drive the production
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.040]   of other hormones.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.540]   We won't get into that too deeply,
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.280]   but if you'd like to learn about FSH,
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.180]   follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone,
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:23.280]   please see the episode on optimizing testosterone
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.440]   and estrogen at hubermanlab.com.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.020]   They looked at prolactin and they looked at growth hormone.
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.460]   I'll just cut to the chase and tell you the effects
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.300]   on growth hormone.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.960]   In subjects that did this two hour a day,
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.820]   80 degree Celsius protocol,
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:43.540]   experienced 16 fold increases in growth hormone.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.700]   So they measured growth hormone before the sauna
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.260]   and after the sauna and growth hormone levels
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:52.600]   went up 16 fold, which is obviously an enormous
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.940]   and it turns out statistically significant effect.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.780]   Now, one important caveat here.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.360]   Remember earlier when I talked about people who did sauna
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.640]   once a week versus two to three times a week
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.160]   versus four to seven times a week.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.360]   And the more often people did sauna,
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.160]   the less likely they were to die of cardiovascular events
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.840]   or other things of that sort.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.280]   Well, in this case,
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.180]   the effects of sauna exposure on growth hormone
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.400]   actually went down the more often
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.320]   that people did this deliberate heat exposure.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.680]   So as I mentioned, they did this two hour a day,
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.360]   divided into 30 minute sessions protocol on day one,
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.040]   day three and day seven of a week.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.120]   And what they found was on day one,
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.320]   there was a 16 fold increase in growth hormone.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.640]   On day three however,
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.780]   there was still a significant effect on growth hormone
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.720]   as compared to before sauna,
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.380]   but that effect was basically cut by two thirds, okay?
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.980]   So now instead of getting a 16 fold increase,
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.940]   it was more like a three or four fold increase,
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.740]   which is still a huge increase,
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.660]   but not as great as the increase observed on day one.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.680]   And then on day seven, there tended to be a two,
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.140]   maybe a three fold increase,
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.000]   but not as great as the one observed on day one.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.060]   What does this mean and why does this happen?
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:15.420]   Well, the reason this happens is because heat,
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.420]   just like cold is a shock or a stressor to the system.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.580]   In the context of cold,
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.860]   if you get into a very cold ice bath, for instance,
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.540]   a five degree ice bath, even for 20 seconds,
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:33.580]   it's known to increase norepinephrine 200%.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.500]   It can double the amount of norepinephrine
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.660]   that you suddenly release into your brain and body,
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.260]   which actually can have some positive effects.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.380]   I'll talk about those in a little bit,
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.820]   but if you were to do that every day,
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.800]   you become cold adapted.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.240]   This circuit that compares the shell and core of your body
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.180]   would adjust in ways that it could either predict
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.460]   that cold stimulus or more likely
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.620]   to create some thermogenic mechanisms
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.420]   in preparation for that cold exposure.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.800]   This is why, for instance,
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.500]   people that use deliberate cold exposure
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.100]   to try and increase lipolysis, the burning of fat,
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.720]   oftentimes will get results for a while,
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.300]   but then if they're doing it a lot, a lot,
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.120]   they stop getting those effects.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.340]   I talk a lot about avoiding cold adaptation
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.400]   if that's your goal in the episode on cold,
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.820]   but similar mechanisms are at play here.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.860]   So we have to imagine that when these subjects
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.180]   got into the sauna on day one,
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:27.400]   whatever pathways went from measurement of temperature
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.620]   at the shell to changes in temperature at the core
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.700]   led to these big increases in growth hormone,
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.580]   which is basically a way of just describing the result
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.220]   I already told you before.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.860]   But the fact that that result diminished over time
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.140]   either means that the circuit was not as efficient
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.700]   in communicating that shift in temperature
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:46.620]   or that that shift in temperature was of less impact
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.220]   because the downstream effectors
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.140]   were not engaged to the same extent
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.860]   because it wasn't as much of a shock.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.060]   And I think the latter explanation is far more likely.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.740]   This is very much akin to weight training
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.180]   or cardiovascular exercise,
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.700]   where if you run up a hill very fast, for instance,
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.080]   and your lungs are burning
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.300]   and you're heaving and breathing hard,
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.820]   on the first day, that's a very painful thing.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:09.940]   But if you do it every day or every other day,
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.540]   provided you allow yourself to recover,
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.720]   pretty soon you're running up that hill
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.420]   and you're not breathing as hard.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.620]   There isn't much burning in your muscles,
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.340]   et cetera, et cetera, your body adapts.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.580]   So one of the key things to understand
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.700]   about the use of deliberate heat exposure
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.900]   is if you're going to use it in order to try
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.340]   and trigger massive increases in growth hormone,
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.740]   you're going to need to be careful about not doing it more
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.400]   than let's say once a week.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.420]   Now I'm extrapolating from this study,
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.900]   maybe once every 10 days would be even better.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.640]   But if you start getting heat adapted,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.060]   it's very unlikely that you're going to get
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.460]   these massive increases in growth hormone.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.880]   So I don't mean to be discouraging
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.380]   of using deliberate heat exposure
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.640]   to access growth hormone increases,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.920]   but if that's your specific goal or your main goal,
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.240]   then I think it's reasonable to say
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.380]   that you don't want to do deliberate heat exposure,
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.480]   at least not of the sort that I described here,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.140]   more than once a week, or maybe even once every 10 days.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.400]   And that you would want to time that to other events
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.340]   in your life, maybe hard workouts,
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.380]   or if you're trying to push through a fat loss barrier,
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.020]   or simply in order to access growth hormone at peak levels,
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:17.160]   maybe three times per month or four times per month.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.540]   If you start doing deliberate heat exposure more often,
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.660]   you'll still get increases in growth hormone,
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.140]   but they are not going to be nearly as large
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.940]   as the increases in growth hormone
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:29.420]   that you're going to experience if you shock your system
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.620]   with deliberate heat exposure every once in a while.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.520]   An important way to frame this
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.140]   is actually in the context of cold.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:36.980]   And while you might say,
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.820]   "Wait, this is an episode on heat and heating, not cold."
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.980]   You really can't have a conversation about heat and heating
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:45.780]   without talking about cold, because as I mentioned earlier,
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.400]   if you cool the outside of your body, the shell,
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.020]   you're actually heating up your body.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.620]   In fact, the circuits that control heating of the body
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.100]   and that control cooling of the body,
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.340]   for instance, the activation of things like shiver
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.880]   or fat loss in response to cold and shiver,
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.260]   those are also controlled by the preoptic area
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.980]   of the hypothalamus.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.920]   So we can take a step back and start to think about
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.220]   what it would take to design the optimal protocol
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.300]   for deliberate heat exposure by looking at cold.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.460]   And here's what I mean.
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.740]   There have been beautiful studies showing
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.500]   that if people get into a very cold body of water,
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.120]   four degrees Celsius for 20 seconds, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.080]   that will cause a 200 to 300% increase in norepinephrine.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.400]   Norepinephrine is also called noradrenaline,
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.080]   and norepinephrine and other so-called catecholamines
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.560]   like dopamine increase dramatically
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.920]   in this very brief cold water exposure.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.280]   And those increases in norepinephrine and dopamine
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   are known to have long lasting effects
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.720]   that generally to improvements in mood, focus,
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.600]   and alertness.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.020]   They're pretty significant.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.240]   However, they aren't significant enough
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.120]   to increase metabolism to a very high degree.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.000]   Whereas other studies have shown that if people go outside
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.240]   in 16 degrees Celsius weather with a proper amount,
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.920]   but a fairly minimum amount of clothing,
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.560]   you can experience even greater increases in norepinephrine.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.720]   But the time that's required in order to experience
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.840]   those increases is six hours at, for instance,
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.360]   16 degrees Celsius.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.540]   So if you have six hours a day to be out there in the cold,
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.060]   or if you're going to turn the air conditioning on
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.380]   in an environment, make it very, very cold, fine.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.420]   But basically what I'm describing is that you can sort of
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.880]   bookend the parameters that you can use.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.440]   You can use a very brief exposure to cold or to heat
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.180]   in order to stimulate heat shock proteins,
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.560]   growth hormone, et cetera.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.780]   Or you can use longer exposure in less intense versions
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.240]   of heat and cold.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.780]   You really have to find what's going to work for you
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.420]   and what you can do safely.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.200]   And if you're confused about where to start,
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.560]   please use the parameters that I described earlier.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.720]   First of all, check with your doctor as always,
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.600]   make sure that you're somebody who can do deliberate cold
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.720]   or heat exposure safely, but that 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.660]   meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.920]   that I keep repeating over and over,
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.160]   'cause I know somebody is going to ask,
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.420]   even though I repeat it over and over, which is fine.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.440]   I'm delighted to keep saying it and to respond
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.540]   if someone asks again.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.960]   Well, those parameters are going to kind of bookend
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.160]   what you should do in terms of the intensity
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.720]   of the heat stimulus.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.540]   How long?
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.180]   Well, we heard earlier, five to 20 minutes.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.780]   Why not start with five and then ramp it up to 10 or 15?
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.820]   And then if you're feeling really bold
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.500]   and you really want to crank out growth hormone,
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.060]   well, then you could do that 30 minute,
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.000]   four times in one day stimulus every once in a while.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:28.980]   So you have to really figure out
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.900]   what you're using heat exposure for.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.020]   This is one of the reasons why when people say,
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.220]   is it better to get in a wet sauna or dry sauna?
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.160]   What's the optimal temperature?
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.100]   Is it better to take a hot shower or a hot bath
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:40.940]   or a hot tub?
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.020]   To be completely honest,
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:44.640]   it depends on what you're going to be able to do regularly,
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.100]   whether or not you want to do it regularly,
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.560]   and what your specific goals are.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.660]   So the purpose of this episode is really to arm you
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.980]   with the underlying mechanisms
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.920]   and to arm you with the general parameters
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.920]   that are going to allow you to access the results
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.760]   that you're seeking.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.200]   For what it's worth, I personally use a protocol
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.120]   and I've been using a protocol for a long time
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:03.500]   that involves trying, meaning I accomplish this most weeks,
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.360]   not all, trying to get into a sauna
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:10.100]   for three 20 minute sessions every week.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.220]   I use a dry sauna, so it's not a steam room.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.380]   If I don't have access to it,
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.180]   I might take a hot bath or something of that sort.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.020]   But in general,
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.740]   I just stick to doing the sauna three times a week.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:23.380]   And I generally will do that either after a workout,
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.080]   either a cardiovascular workout or a weight workout,
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.240]   or I'll do it later in the evening.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.860]   Why later in the evening?
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:33.100]   Well, it has to do with the circadian shifts in temperature
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.780]   that we all experience.
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:37.580]   Talked a lot about this in the circadian episodes
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.800]   and the episodes related to sleep,
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.120]   but in a nutshell, here's how it works.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.680]   Every early morning, about two hours
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.560]   before your typical wake-up time,
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.160]   your body temperature is at its all time lowest.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.200]   We call that your temperature minimum.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.400]   Right about waking, your body temperature increases.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.860]   In fact, an increase in body temperature
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:59.300]   is part of the reason you wake up at all,
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.400]   unless of course you're setting an alarm.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.420]   Increases in body temperature are going to be
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:08.320]   one of the major things that wakes up your brain and body.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.160]   Body temperature will tend to continue
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.580]   to increase through the morning.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.980]   You'll get that increase in cortisol
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.900]   that's a healthy increase in cortisol.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.000]   Body temperature will increase into the afternoon,
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.220]   and then will start to drop in the later afternoon.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.160]   This general contour can be shifted
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.540]   by whether or not you exercise, how often you eat,
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.040]   because of the so-called thermogenic effects of food.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.120]   That is, every time you eat,
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.600]   there's a slight increase in body temperature and metabolism,
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.960]   but it's not really that significant
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.560]   to throw off this general contour and rhythm.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.000]   But toward the afternoon, around four or five o'clock,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.740]   most days, depending on time of year,
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.140]   your body temperature will peak,
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.640]   and then it will start to drop.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.240]   And as your body temperature drops by one to three degrees,
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.040]   and here I'm referring to your core body temperature,
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.280]   not your shell body temperature,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.560]   you will start to get sleepy and to transition into sleep
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.300]   and to maintain sleep throughout the night,
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.040]   your body temperature will remain low
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.240]   until you hit that temperature minimum,
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.560]   and then it'll start to come up again, okay?
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.520]   What that means is that when you decide to do sauna,
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.640]   or cold exposure for that matter, is going to be important.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.460]   Why?
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.800]   Well, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.860]   if you were to make the surface of your body cold,
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.580]   at least in the immediate period after that,
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.880]   your body temperature will increase.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.300]   So for those of you that are challenged in getting to sleep
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.860]   and are still working on your sleep,
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.160]   remember, sleep is the foundation
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.660]   of all mental and physical health and optimal performance.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.000]   You should try to get really quality sleep
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.420]   of sufficient duration at least 80% of nights.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.860]   That should be an ongoing goal throughout your lifespan
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.540]   for a huge number of reasons.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.960]   Watch the master sleep episode
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.280]   if you'd like to hear more of those reasons
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.340]   and the mechanisms to make sure that you do that.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:44.520]   But in any event, cold exposure late in the evening
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.280]   will start to increase your body temperature again,
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.440]   and that can make it hard for some people to fall asleep.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.360]   Now, if you're very, very tired,
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.000]   because you've been working hard or training hard
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.320]   or both throughout the day,
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.500]   might not throw off your sleep so much.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.640]   I've gone through bouts where I'm just so, so busy
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.560]   from morning till night that the only time I can get
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.840]   into the ice bath or the cold shower is late in the evening,
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.800]   and I have no trouble sleeping after that.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.240]   However, if you have trouble sleeping,
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.080]   I would recommend doing the cold exposure early in the day
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.340]   to match that natural heating,
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:15.280]   that natural increase in body temperature
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.700]   that occurs across the 24 hour so-called circadian rhythm.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:23.100]   Similarly, if you're going to use deliberate heat exposure,
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.160]   you'd be wise to do that later in the day.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.800]   You'd be wise to do it later in the day
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.560]   because when you get into a warm environment,
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.280]   sure, the surface of your body, the shell heats up,
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.560]   the core of your body heats up,
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.520]   but then it also activates cooling mechanisms
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.280]   through the preoptic area.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.800]   And when you get out of that hot environment,
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.660]   sauna or otherwise, your body will continue to cool down.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:49.640]   And so many people find that if they do sauna
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.040]   in the later half of the day, or even just before sleep,
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.140]   and then take a warmish shower afterwards,
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.860]   then they find it easier to fall asleep.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.700]   And that makes sense
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.200]   because their body temperature is dropping.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.800]   And in fact, if your goal is to really promote
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.720]   the maximum amount of growth hormone release,
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.640]   that's also going to be the best time of day to do it,
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.920]   especially if you haven't eaten
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.800]   in the two hours before sleep, okay?
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.920]   So if you're really going for growth hormone release,
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.360]   you're really trying to optimize sleep,
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.920]   and the two things are actually linked
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.240]   because of the release of growth hormone
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.120]   that happens from the pituitary in the early night's sleep,
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.600]   well, then you would be wise to do your sauna
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.160]   maybe once or maybe twice a week in the evening
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.880]   or at nighttime, then taking a warm or cool shower,
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.880]   just briefly, just enough to kind of rinse off
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.600]   all the sweat from the sauna, and then get ready for sleep
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.080]   and to do that, not necessarily fasted,
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.000]   but to try and keep your levels of glucose and insulin
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.580]   somewhat low in your bloodstream.
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.280]   The reason I say that is that
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.420]   having elevated blood glucose and/or insulin
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.480]   tends to blunt or reduce growth hormone release,
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.520]   and that's true for any number of different stimuli,
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.920]   including exercise and including sauna.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.240]   So there's a really nice study on this
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.800]   that I can point you to.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.120]   There's a study that was published in the journal "Stress,"
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.600]   literally, that's the name of the journal.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.360]   I love it when journals have these names like pain or stress.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.160]   I find that somewhat amusing for reasons that escape me,
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.080]   but nonetheless, amuse me.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.040]   The title of this study is "Growth Hormone Response
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.300]   "to Different Consecutive Stress Stimuli in Healthy Men.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.280]   "Is There Any Difference?"
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.320]   And I don't want to go into all the details of the study
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.440]   because it's pretty extensive and complicated,
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.080]   but basically what they did is that they had people do sauna
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.600]   and then gave them a drug or a condition of having low,
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.260]   not dangerously low, but low blood sugar,
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:34.600]   or they had them in a condition
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.320]   where they had low blood sugar and then did sauna,
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.260]   or they had them do an exercise protocol
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.860]   that led them to increase growth hormone
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.260]   and then had them do low blood sugar,
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:47.160]   basically mixing and matching the various stimuli
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.980]   that could increase growth hormone.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:51.660]   And what they found was very straightforward.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.340]   What they found was that doing sauna once
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.360]   and then waiting some period of time
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.820]   and then later that day doing sauna again,
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:02.240]   they didn't see the same increase in growth hormone
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.560]   both times.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.260]   First, they got a big increase in growth hormone
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:07.560]   and then less if they did sauna again.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.240]   If they had people do exercise and then sauna,
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.840]   what they found was exercise could stimulate growth hormone,
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.560]   but then following it with sauna did not allow you
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.520]   to get twice as much growth hormone.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.000]   In general, anytime you release growth hormone,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.440]   you reduce the likelihood
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.160]   that you're going to release growth hormone again
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.240]   later that day.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   And this partially explains that earlier study
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.360]   where if people did this growth hormone promoting protocol
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.960]   on day one, but then on day three,
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.360]   they didn't see quite as big an effect.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.880]   And on day seven, they didn't see quite as big effect.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.240]   All it basically boils down to is that
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.260]   if you really want to crank out the most amount
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:43.600]   of growth hormone in response to sauna,
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.480]   do it fasted or at least not having ingested any food
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.180]   in the two or three hours before.
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.360]   You don't have to be deep into a fast.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.100]   And the whole notion of what breaks a fast
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.600]   is kind of an interesting conversation
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.320]   because it's contextual, right?
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.000]   Will a sip of coffee break your fast?
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.060]   Well, maybe, probably not.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.320]   Will one grain of sugar break your fast?
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.160]   No.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.960]   Will an entire candy bar break your fast?
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.460]   Yes, it has to do with where your blood glucose is
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.240]   when you ingest that particular food item,
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.120]   not so much what that food item is per se.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.200]   But the bottom line here is if you want to crank out
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.840]   the most amount of growth hormone,
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.320]   wait a couple of hours after eating
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.680]   before getting into the sauna,
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.920]   or maybe do it before dinner and then prepare dinner,
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.700]   do the sauna before dinner that is,
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.520]   then prepare dinner, then eat dinner,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.540]   and then make sure that you wait a few hours
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.620]   before going to sleep.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.380]   You're going to have to arrange your schedule accordingly.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.460]   I know most people can't arrange their schedule perfectly
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.940]   just to get growth hormone increases,
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.380]   nor do I think people should approach
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.740]   health protocols that way.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:42.140]   I think for 90% of people, 90% of the time,
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:45.560]   just getting into the sauna once or twice
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.620]   or three times a week is going to be beneficial
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.180]   for the number of reasons that I described earlier.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.320]   And you don't want to obsess too much
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.060]   about the exact conditions you need
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.740]   in order to get the greatest effect
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.160]   out of that sauna treatment.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.680]   These are just some additional tweaks
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.520]   related to food intake and low-level hypoglycemia
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.300]   and exercise that if you wanted to leverage, you could.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.920]   So if decreases in body temperature
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.000]   tend to aid the transition to sleep
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.780]   and getting out of a hot sauna
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.300]   tends to promote decreases in body temperature,
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:16.940]   it makes sense why you would want to put your sauna exposure
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.220]   or other deliberate heat exposure
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.600]   in the second half of your day
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.360]   and maybe even right before sleep.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.240]   Now, regardless of what time of day you do sauna
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.700]   or how frequently you do it,
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:29.280]   you're going to want to hydrate after going in the sauna.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.500]   When you go in the sauna, you lose water.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.040]   And when you lose water, you need to replace it.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:34.880]   Why?
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.180]   Well, you need water for all your cells,
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.380]   but you also need electrolytes.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.420]   So make sure that you're replacing the water
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.140]   that you lose in the sauna.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:43.740]   Now there's no exact formula of how much water to drink
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.440]   and whether or not you need electrolytes
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.520]   in that water or not.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.000]   It's going to depend on how much you sweat,
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.400]   meaning how heat adapted you are.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.860]   It's going to depend on how much salt you tend to excrete
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.620]   in your sweat, huge amount of variation.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.060]   But in general, one way to approach this would be
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.760]   to make sure that you drink at least 16 ounces of water
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.120]   for every 10 minutes that you happen to be in the sauna.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.860]   You could do that before and during and after,
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.940]   you could do it during and after, or you could do it after.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:12.600]   Now, there are other reasons to do deliberate heat exposure
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.160]   that have nothing to do with cardiovascular effects,
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.240]   nothing to do with growth hormone or anything of that sort,
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.100]   but rather have to do with improvements
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.820]   in mood and mental health.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.100]   In fact, the data related to sauna
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.780]   and other forms of deliberate heat exposure improving mood
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:31.020]   are very impressive, both at the mechanistic level
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.700]   and in terms of the long-term consequences
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.220]   that people experience.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.260]   First of all, we need to ask,
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.360]   how is it that deliberate heat exposure
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.180]   can improve our mood and wellbeing?
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:43.340]   Well, it turns out that it improves mood and wellbeing,
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.200]   but it also improves our capacity to feel good
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.300]   in response to things
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.820]   that would ordinarily make us feel somewhat good.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.520]   Now, this is not a situation
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.500]   where you're going to be walking around,
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.500]   grinning ear to ear in response to nothing at all,
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.180]   simply because you went in a sauna.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:04.140]   What I'm talking about is the upregulation of pathways,
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.820]   meaning chemical pathways in your brain and body
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.060]   that allow you to experience pleasure in all its fullness.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.160]   So here's how this whole deliberate heat exposure
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.020]   sauna mood thing works.
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:17.380]   Many of you have probably heard of endorphins.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.780]   Endorphins are a category of molecules
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.140]   that are made naturally in your brain and body
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:23.860]   and that are released in response
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.580]   to different forms of stressors.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.160]   That's right, in response to stressors.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.500]   So if ever you've gone out on a long run
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:31.580]   and at some point in that run,
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.660]   you feel like you're aching and your joints hurt,
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.580]   or maybe you have shin splints and you push through that,
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.660]   part of the reason that you experience a lack of pain
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.400]   at some point usually,
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.340]   or you experience a euphoria during or after that exercise
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:50.240]   is the exercise induced effects on endorphin release,
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.100]   or rather to be more specific,
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.700]   I should say the exercise induced consequences
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.860]   on the stress system,
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.740]   which in turn trigger the release of endorphin.
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:02.660]   In other words, when we experience short-term
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:06.780]   or acute stress, the endorphin system is activated.
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:10.100]   Now the endorphin system is not just about feeling good,
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.700]   believe it or not, it's also about feeling bad.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.980]   And there are two general categories of endorphins.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.100]   The first are the ones that you normally hear about,
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.460]   endorphins, things that bind, for instance,
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.540]   to receptors like the mu opioid receptor.
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.580]   Opioids are not just prescribed compounds
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.500]   or unfortunately drugs of abuse, which they are, right?
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.500]   We have this opioid crisis in the United States
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.700]   and elsewhere, which is a very serious and tragic thing,
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.260]   but we make endogenous opioids.
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:40.800]   We make endorphins that naturally act as pain relievers
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.640]   and that make us feel mildly euphoric.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.160]   We also make endorphins such as dynorphin,
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.160]   that's D-Y-N-O-R-P-H-I-N, dynorphin,
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.000]   that actually make us feel worse in response to stressors.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.440]   When we get into a hot sauna
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.720]   or a hot environment of any kind,
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.880]   dynorphins are liberated in the brain and body.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.680]   And I should mention that dynorphins are made
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.280]   by many neurons in many different areas of the brain.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.560]   So you might think, well, why would I want that?
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.020]   Why would I want to release dynorphin into my brain and body?
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:15.860]   Well, first of all,
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:19.220]   when you get into an uncomfortably hot situation,
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.480]   uncomfortably hot scenario, oh gosh,
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.500]   this is sounding terrible,
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:26.480]   in a deliberately hot environment that you are using
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.740]   to try and trigger some sort of biological
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.080]   or psychological benefit, I should say,
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.860]   the discomfort that you feel,
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.340]   the desire to get out of that environment
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.640]   is in part the consequence of the release of dynorphin.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.700]   It's also the consequence of the activation
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.920]   of that sympathetic nervous system.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.920]   Remember the preoptic area can communicate with the amygdala
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.800]   and trigger that kind of fight or flight mode.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.800]   I want to get out of the sauna.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.200]   This is really, really hot.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.440]   But dynorphin is also liberated
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.600]   from a certain number of neurons.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.720]   Dynorphin binds to what's called the kappa receptor.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.720]   The kappa receptor binds dynorphin
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.100]   and triggers pathways in the brain and body
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.780]   that lead to agitation, to stress,
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.660]   and believe it or not, to a general sense of pain.
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:13.180]   This is why you want to get out of the hot sauna.
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.580]   And remember, if it's unsafe levels of hot,
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.400]   then you should get out of that sauna
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.200]   or other hot environment.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.220]   But if you're working in a range
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:23.020]   or you're exposing yourself to a range of heat
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.380]   that's uncomfortable but safe to be in,
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.920]   dynorphin will be liberated from these neurons,
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.220]   bind to the kappa receptor.
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:33.620]   And as a downstream consequence of that,
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.820]   there will be an increase in the receptors
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.820]   that bind the other endorphins,
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.740]   the endorphins that make you feel soothed,
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:41.900]   that make you feel happy,
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.500]   and that make you feel mild euphoria.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.780]   So there've been a number of studies showing
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:48.020]   that initially deliberate heat exposure
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.220]   by sauna or otherwise causes the release of dynorphin.
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.700]   In fact, I think it's fair to say
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:55.100]   that every time we get into a hot environment
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.920]   that's uncomfortable or a cold environment
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:59.220]   that's uncomfortable, dynorphin is likely released
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.920]   and binding to the kappa receptor.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:04.980]   But over time, that binding of dynorphin
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.260]   to the kappa receptor leads to downstream changes
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.740]   in the way that the feel-good endorphins,
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.660]   things like endorphin binding to the mu opioid receptor,
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:17.480]   and there are still other feel-good endorphins, so to speak,
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.340]   that system becomes much more efficient
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.240]   such that people feel an elevation
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.060]   in their baseline level of mood.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.920]   And when a good or happy event comes along,
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.900]   they feel a heightened level of happiness or joy or awe
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:34.180]   or improved mood in response to that.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:36.760]   This is not unlike the effects of caffeine
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.060]   on the dopamine receptor that I've described previously.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.320]   And for those of you that aren't familiar with it,
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:44.260]   many of you drink caffeine and love it.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.620]   Part of the reason you love it is because of the release
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:50.080]   of certain neurochemicals like norepinephrine, et cetera,
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.980]   the energy that it gives you, maybe the taste,
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.260]   I would hope as well.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.420]   But caffeine ingestion also causes increases
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.300]   in dopamine receptor concentration and efficacy.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.880]   In other words, it allows the receptors for dopamine
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.680]   to work better so that for a given amount
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.600]   of dopamine release,
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.820]   you experience more pleasure and motivation.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.120]   This is a similar mechanism,
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.900]   but within the endorphin pathway.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:12.860]   So what does it mean?
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.360]   It means that a little bit of discomfort
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.380]   as a consequence of deliberate heat exposure,
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.380]   while in the short term, doesn't feel good by definition,
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.500]   it is activating pathways that are allowing
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.120]   the feel-good molecules and neural circuitries
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.640]   that exist in your brain and body
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.360]   to increase their efficiency,
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.460]   placing you in a better position to be joyful
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.220]   in response to the events of life.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.020]   I confess I'm very excited about the data
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.180]   on deliberate heat exposure and improvements
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:44.100]   in the chemical systems that underlie good mood.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.340]   And just to underscore this further,
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:51.340]   the dynorphin system is not unique to heat-induced stress.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.180]   In fact, there are beautiful studies and reviews out there
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:58.820]   about the role of dynorphin in stress and depression,
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:01.480]   in stress and alcoholism,
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.520]   just as a brief aside and in the future,
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.300]   we will do a whole episode on alcohol and alcoholism,
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.220]   but turns out that chronic alcohol use
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:12.900]   and alcoholism causes changes in dopamine receptors
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.820]   that make it very difficult for people to achieve pleasure
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.560]   through things other than alcohol and even alcohol.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.860]   That's kind of the really diabolical nature of addiction,
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.900]   which is the thing that initially brings pleasure,
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:27.760]   eventually is just required to maintain baseline levels
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.840]   of dopamine.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.040]   And I've talked before and Dr. Anna Lemke,
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.440]   when she was a guest on this podcast,
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.180]   talked about the pleasure playing balance
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.380]   that exists within the dopamine system.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.680]   And it's beautifully described in her book,
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.380]   "Dopamine Nation," by the way,
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:45.140]   excellent book I recommend to all people, addicts or not.
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:49.180]   Well, in that context of pleasure and pain,
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.460]   it's very clear what the pleasure molecule is.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.800]   It's actually a molecule more related to motivation
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.580]   and that's dopamine.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:59.620]   The pain molecule, however, appears to be dynorphin.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:03.400]   And the fact that dynorphin is dysregulated
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.240]   in stress and depression and alcoholism
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.640]   and the relationship between dynorphin and dopamine
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.960]   is something that we should all take very seriously.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.940]   And for that reason, I'm very excited about the fact
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:16.440]   that deliberate heat exposure can leverage
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.780]   the dynorphin system in a short-term and acute way
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:23.620]   that allows mood to improve after the sauna exposure.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.620]   So for those of you that don't like heat exposure,
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:31.220]   keep in mind that a lot of the observed positive effects
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.740]   on our biology relate to metabolism,
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.860]   cardiovascular function, but also mental health.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.500]   And along those lines, there's a wonderful study,
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.260]   again, published in 2018.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.300]   I don't know why, I guess 2018 was a big year
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:47.360]   for deliberate heat exposure studies.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.860]   The title of this study is "Sauna Bathing
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.740]   "and Risk of Psychotic Disorders."
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.140]   And this was a prospective cohort study.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.200]   Again, we'll provide a link to this study.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.980]   It's a really interesting study that explored
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.260]   the relationship between mental health,
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:04.260]   so people suffering from various forms of psychosis,
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.980]   schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis, and use of sauna.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.320]   So essentially what this study did is they looked
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.980]   at a very large number of subjects,
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.800]   more than 2000 subjects who had no history
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.220]   of psychotic disorders.
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:17.740]   They were classified into three groups
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:20.220]   based on their frequency of sauna use,
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:23.120]   either once a week, two to three times per week,
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.860]   or four to seven times per week.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.480]   This should call to mind that earlier study
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.780]   on all-risk mortality and cardiovascular event risk.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:35.180]   And then they explored the hazard ratio
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.380]   for psychosis specifically, meaning how likely it was
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:40.540]   that people would develop psychotic symptoms
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.900]   or full-blown psychotic illness
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.980]   according to their frequency of sauna session.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.780]   So again, this isn't causal, this is correlative.
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.820]   And according to the data in this study,
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:53.120]   what they concluded is that there was a strong
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.340]   and inverse independent association
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.700]   between frequent sauna bathing and the future risk
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:00.780]   of psychotic disorders in this population.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:03.820]   Now, this does not mean that going into a sauna
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:05.920]   seven times per week is going to prevent people
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.320]   from becoming schizophrenic necessarily,
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.740]   or from having a psychotic episode necessarily.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:14.160]   And of course, frequent sauna use will be related
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.800]   to other health promoting activities.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.200]   But in this study, as in the previous study,
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.140]   they went to great lengths in order to try
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:24.320]   and limit those so-called confounding variables.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.160]   Now, of course, this is just one study.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.560]   And again, it's correlative, not causal,
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.380]   but based on the large number of subjects they included,
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:34.320]   plus the rigor of the statistical analysis,
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.080]   we're starting to see a general picture
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.800]   that using the sorts of sauna protocols
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.520]   that I've described throughout this episode,
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:46.520]   five to 20 minutes or so, done one to seven times per week,
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.960]   is associated with a general improvement
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.280]   in cardiovascular health,
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.440]   a general improvement in mental health.
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.120]   And it really points to the fact that yes,
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.180]   sauna done acutely for three or four times a day,
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:03.520]   30 minutes each session separated by cooling,
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.920]   maybe getting into cold bath.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.160]   Sure, that can potently increase growth hormone,
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.260]   but done on a more regular basis can reduce cortisol,
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.920]   improve heart health, improve mental health.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.520]   And for that reason, and the fact that for most people,
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.220]   it is conceivable to come up with a way
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:21.080]   that you could get into deliberate heat exposure
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.880]   for a minimum of cost, right?
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.680]   It's a hot bath, or if you had to resort to bundling up
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.200]   and going for a jog, this sort of thing,
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.960]   or if you have access to it, a sauna of some sort,
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.920]   that we're really talking about a stimulus
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.480]   to initiate a large number of different biological cascades
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.280]   that wick out to improve multiple aspects
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:43.580]   of brain and body health.
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.900]   So up until now, I've been talking about whole body heating.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.660]   So for instance, putting your whole body into the sauna,
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.880]   which of course is what most people do,
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:55.000]   or getting into a hot tub or hot bath up to your neck,
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.440]   or in the cases where we were talking
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.840]   about deliberate cold exposure
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:01.720]   as a means to increase core body temperature and metabolism,
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.180]   getting into an ice bath or cold water of some sort
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:08.160]   up to your neck or into a cold shower, et cetera.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.120]   Now I'd like to talk about deliberately heating
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.980]   or cooling specific parts of the body,
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.280]   meaning certain surface areas of your body
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.460]   as a means to get effects on those particular areas,
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.680]   as well as at the whole body level.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.000]   Numerous times throughout this episode,
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.060]   I've talked about the dangers of overheating.
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.120]   So what should you do if you think you
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.360]   or someone else is hyperthermic, is too hot?
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.400]   Well, if you understand just a little bit
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.600]   about the cooling and heating systems of your shell and core,
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.580]   there are some terrific tools that you can use
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:41.240]   in order to cool off your core quickly.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.360]   And remember the core consists of the nervous system,
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.740]   the spinal cord and the viscera,
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.140]   which are really the organs you're trying to protect.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:50.940]   So being able to cool off the core of your body quickly
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.160]   can be very beneficial.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:54.440]   And in some cases, it could even save your life.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:58.020]   There is a way to more quickly heat or cool the body.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.540]   And that's through specific elements of your shell,
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:03.700]   meaning particular skin surfaces.
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:06.720]   I've talked extensively about this in the episode on cold.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.720]   It was also covered in the episode with my guest,
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.660]   Dr. Craig Heller from the biology department at Stanford.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:16.520]   It relates to the so-called glabrous skin surfaces
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.080]   on the upper half of our face,
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.760]   palms of our hands and the bottoms of our feet.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.100]   And for those of you that heard this before,
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.060]   I encourage you to continue to listen nonetheless,
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:27.380]   because today I'm going to talk about specifically
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.180]   how to heat the body or cool the body
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.700]   through these glabrous skin surfaces.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:35.640]   Very briefly, the mechanism is as follows.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.260]   The palms of our hands, the bottoms of our feet
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.760]   and the upper half of our face,
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:42.580]   overlies specific types of vasculature,
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:46.540]   meaning specific types of veins and arteries
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.940]   that don't have capillaries between them.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:53.940]   And as a consequence, heat and cold can move very quickly
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:57.100]   from the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:58.500]   and the upper half of our face
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.580]   and change our core body temperature.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:04.400]   There's a name for these particular vascular structures.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:08.160]   They're called AVAs or arteriovenous astomoses.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.040]   Basically, veins and arteries interacting directly
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.140]   without capillaries in between,
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:18.020]   which allows cooling of blood or heating of blood
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.760]   much more quickly than is possible
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.420]   by applying colder heat elsewhere on the body
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.460]   where capillaries intervene between veins and arteries.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.860]   These AVAs, arteriovenous astomoses can be leveraged
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.240]   to cool off your core body temperature very quickly.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.180]   The key thing is to get the palms of your hands,
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:37.020]   the bottoms of your feet and the upper half of your face
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:40.540]   in contact with a cold surface or fluid
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:44.000]   that is cold enough to cool the blood
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.700]   and the core of your body,
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.820]   but not so cold that it constricts the veins
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.660]   just below the palms of your hands,
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:54.080]   the bottoms of your feet or the upper half of your face.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.660]   So not placing ice packs necessarily,
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:00.920]   but maybe placing cool towels on the bottoms of the feet,
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.620]   the palms of the hands and the upper half of the face
[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:05.980]   and as they warm up, replacing those with other cool towels.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:07.260]   The exact temperature will depend
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.900]   on how hot you happen to be.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:09.860]   I can't know that
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:12.140]   without knowing your particular circumstances.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:13.380]   If you'd like to learn more
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:16.200]   about how to cool off your core very quickly
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.340]   and some of the details and some of the technologies
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.020]   that are being developed to do that,
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.840]   please see the episode I did with Craig Heller
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.260]   or the episode on cold.
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.020]   If you don't want to go to those episodes,
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:27.180]   here's a good procedure that you could use.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.780]   You could grab, for instance,
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:32.120]   a package of frozen broccoli or frozen blueberries.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.420]   If someone is really, really warm,
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.840]   make sure they take off their shoes and socks,
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.100]   get their feet on top of those,
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.140]   ideally get some into their hands as well,
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:41.160]   get some cool compresses and get them onto people's face.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:44.080]   You could of course also put a cool compress
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.920]   on the back of the neck and the top of the head.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.560]   That would be an especially good idea
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.780]   if someone were hyperthermic
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.580]   because of the way that cooling of the brain occurs
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.680]   under conditions of hyperthermia.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:57.540]   But the key point here is that just putting cold compresses
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:59.520]   or cold materials onto somebody's torso
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.980]   is not going to be as efficient
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:02.720]   as cooling those glabber skin surfaces,
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.400]   the bottoms of the feet, the palms of the hands
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.660]   and the upper half of their face.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.180]   Similarly, or I suppose to be more accurate,
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:10.420]   I should say conversely,
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:13.060]   there are times when it is desirable
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:15.440]   to heat the core of the body.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.180]   And once again, just simply throwing a hot towel
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:21.140]   over somebody is not going to be the most efficient way.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.120]   If someone is hypothermic, they're too cold,
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.760]   it is not a problem to cover them with a blanket,
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.760]   but ideally what you do is you use some warm object
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:36.740]   or warm fluid to warm the bottoms of their feet,
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:38.800]   their hands and the upper half of their face.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.880]   Of course, not so warm that you burn those skin surfaces.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.440]   This has actually been examined in studies
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.560]   from the Heller lab.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:48.300]   Turns out that for instance, to get people out of anesthesia,
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.440]   it is beneficial to warm their core body temperature.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.940]   And of course there is fever,
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.660]   which you should know is an adaptive response.
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.660]   While fever is uncomfortable,
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.560]   and in fact often involves a mismatch
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.160]   between our perception of our shell
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.120]   and a perception of our core temperature,
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.040]   in other words,
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.880]   there are times when our body temperature is really high,
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:08.040]   we have a fever and yet we're shivering, we're cold.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.340]   And that's because under conditions of fever,
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:15.060]   the immune system liberates certain molecules that impact
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:19.180]   and in some ways intentionally disrupt the preoptic area,
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.600]   the POA and the way it normally functions
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.160]   so that it can override peripheral signals
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.740]   and simply try and heat the body
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:29.640]   and kill whatever pathogen has infected the body.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.520]   So for those of you that think about fever
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.520]   is always a bad thing, it's not.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.680]   Now, of course, we don't want our core body temperature
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.640]   to go so high that tissues of the brain and body are damaged.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.520]   This is one reason why if a fever ever goes above 103,
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.440]   you need to start getting a little bit worried, 104.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.600]   There are times when you need to call an ambulance
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.740]   or go to a hospital.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.400]   You really need to employ cooling methods of the sort
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.040]   that I talked about before to prevent hyperthermia.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.560]   Of course, safe ranges for body temperature
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.760]   vary between infants and adults.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.120]   So you can look those up online
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.180]   depending on the person's age, what is a safe range,
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:06.160]   what is not, but keep in mind that if you are taking
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.360]   compounds, pills to reduce your fever,
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.620]   you're actually short-circuiting the protective mechanism
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.400]   for burning up the pathogen.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.920]   And that's because most pathogens, bacteria and viruses
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.820]   don't survive well at high temperatures.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:19.840]   In fact, in laboratories,
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.660]   if we want to preserve a virus for use,
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.080]   we put it into a freezer.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.480]   If we want to kill a virus, we heat inoculate it.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.800]   So in many ways, fever is your natural form
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.200]   of heat inoculation designed to kill pathogens
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.440]   of various kinds.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.940]   Now, last, but certainly not least,
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.880]   I want to refer to the study that I described
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:38.280]   at the very beginning of this episode
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.480]   involving what's called local hyperthermia
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.320]   in order to trigger a number of biological processes
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:49.160]   in fat tissue, in order to convert white fat to beige fat,
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.200]   which is the metabolically active form of fat.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.500]   Many of you, or at least some of you should be familiar
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.080]   with the fact that deliberate cold exposure
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.440]   can increase brown fat stores,
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.680]   these mitochondrial dense fat stores
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.260]   that can in turn allow a person to feel more comfortable
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:07.800]   in cold temperatures, water or otherwise,
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.320]   and increase core metabolism.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.180]   I talked about this in the episode on cold,
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:14.480]   but very briefly, the general protocol again,
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.640]   is to get 11 minutes total per week of uncomfortable,
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.320]   yet safe, deliberate cold exposure,
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.860]   either through ice bath, cold shower,
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.920]   cold immersion up to the neck,
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.580]   or some other form of cold exposure.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.180]   That triggers increases in brown fat,
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:32.740]   that's been beautifully shown by Dr. Susanna Soberg,
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.940]   and that increase in brown fat in turn
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:37.300]   increases core metabolism and one's ability
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:40.060]   to feel comfortable in cold temperatures.
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.400]   This was a study done in humans,
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.940]   and there's now ample evidence from animal models
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.100]   to support that this is a general phenomenon
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:50.340]   that I think most people could use and benefit from.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:53.420]   Local hyperthermia is a distinctly different phenomenon.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.660]   It involves heating a particular surface of the body
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.300]   as a way to convert the white fat at that location
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:04.660]   to beige fat, which in turn leads to more systemic increases
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:07.940]   in thermogenesis and increases in metabolism,
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.760]   and believe it or not, in fat loss.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.140]   Now, the study that I'm referring to
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.060]   is a very recent study that was published again
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:17.100]   in this terrific apex journal, Cell, Cell Press Journal,
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.060]   and again, one of the three top journals,
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:21.160]   Nature Science and Cell are the three top journals.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.460]   Top because they're the most competitive,
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:25.680]   but also generally, not always,
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.060]   but generally the most stringent
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.340]   in terms of the review process.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.400]   Papers that make it into these three journals
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.580]   generally are of very, very high quality,
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:33.720]   and certainly enough people see them
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.260]   that if they're not of high quality,
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.540]   they get shot down pretty quickly
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:37.740]   in a short amount of time,
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:39.740]   whereas papers in other journals can sometimes
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.840]   last a long time before they're ever replicated, et cetera.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.820]   The title of this paper is Local Hyperthermia Therapy
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:50.820]   Induces Browning of White Fat and Treats Obesity.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:54.400]   This was a study that was performed on mice and humans
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.900]   in the same study.
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:59.100]   What the study involved was heating of a local patch of skin
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.640]   to 41 degrees Celsius,
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:04.360]   which is 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.720]   but not damaging the skin, okay?
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.180]   So the methods of heating did not involve
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:11.980]   placing something on the skin that would damage it.
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:13.460]   In fact, in the study on the mice,
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:17.440]   they use this kind of clever molecular chicanery
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.280]   in order to do it,
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.200]   and in humans, they used a thermocouple
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.760]   that would allow them to heat the skin up just locally,
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.020]   in particular locations on the body
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.020]   that I'll talk about in a moment.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:32.020]   They refer to this process as LHT or local heat therapy.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:36.980]   The reason they did this is worth considering.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:40.300]   It's long been known from clinical data,
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.420]   and in fact, from a bit of research data,
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:47.420]   that people that experience burn on a small or unfortunately,
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.940]   in some circumstances, significant portion of their body,
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:54.580]   experience overall decreases in body fat
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.420]   and increases in metabolism that can last many years.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.120]   Now, of course, is not reasonable,
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.440]   nor would one ever want to induce burn
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.420]   in order to induce fat loss,
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:08.600]   but the observed increases in metabolism and fat loss
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.820]   in response to skin surface burn couldn't be explained
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:16.220]   by reductions in activity related to the burn, for instance.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:19.540]   And in fact, there are molecular pathways
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:22.120]   related to something called UCP-1,
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.060]   which is uncoupling protein one.
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.820]   I talked about this also in the cold episode,
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:27.640]   but don't worry if you didn't see that episode
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.780]   or if you choose not to.
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:33.780]   UCP-1 has the ability to increase mitochondrial function
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.200]   in ways that increase core body temperature overall,
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.880]   in particular in beige and brown fat,
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.380]   which are these fat cells
[01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:44.020]   that exist generally along our spine,
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.140]   and in particular in the upper part of our back
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.960]   and around our neck and clavicles,
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.860]   and they're responsible for acting as a sort of a candle,
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:55.940]   or I should say the fuel or the fat of a candle
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:00.260]   that can be burned up to manufacture heat in the body.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.300]   So if you normally think about fat
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.560]   and you think about blubbery fat,
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.100]   you're thinking about white fat,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.660]   which again is just a storage site.
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:09.680]   Beige fat and brown fat exist at just a few locations,
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:13.060]   mainly internally around our spinal cord and our clavicles,
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:15.160]   and those fat stores are responsible
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.580]   for generating heat in our body,
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:20.560]   so they are very metabolically active form of fat.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.800]   Small children have a lot of brown fat and beige fat,
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:26.980]   in particular because very young children can't shiver,
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:28.660]   and a number of you probably didn't know that,
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:30.360]   but very young children can't shiver,
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:31.860]   so they need some way to generate heat
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.480]   in order to make sure that they stay alive
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.020]   if they were ever to get cold.
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.140]   This is also probably the reason why little kids
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.700]   can run around on a cold day outside without their shirt on
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:40.840]   and they don't even seem to notice
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.060]   whereas adults are freezing cold.
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:45.740]   As we get older, the amount of beige and brown fat
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:50.740]   tends to either reduce or shrink or disappear entirely,
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:53.000]   it's still debated, which happens,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.840]   but we know that white fat can be converted
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.860]   to this more metabolically active form of beige fat
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.960]   by deliberate cold exposure,
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.860]   according to the protocol I talked about earlier,
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:07.340]   and now it seems, based on this new study,
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:12.340]   that local heating of skin tissue can also induce UCP-1
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.540]   and the effects of UCP-1 on increasing mitochondria,
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:19.240]   and in fact, that local hyperthermia,
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.160]   41 degrees Celsius, that is 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.840]   can actually induce the conversion
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.960]   of white fat to beige fat.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:28.980]   Now that's pretty interesting,
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:31.260]   and I can already predict the way this is probably going to go
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:33.360]   in the kind of wellness and biohacking
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.360]   and longevity communities.
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.560]   I'm sure that pretty soon there are going to be
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:39.520]   people putting heating pads on different fat pads of theirs
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.880]   on their body, trying to reduce
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:43.560]   or at least convert the white fat into beige fat,
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.720]   and who knows, maybe that'll work.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:47.280]   There have not been many controlled studies of this yet.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.680]   This is the first, at least to my knowledge,
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:53.560]   of such studies looking at this in non-burn conditions.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.200]   Nonetheless, the data are mechanistically
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.560]   even more interesting than this whole business about UCP-1,
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.460]   and here's why.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:03.400]   Local hyperthermia,
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.600]   using the protocol that I described before,
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:09.520]   resulted in the increase of a promoter,
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.980]   which is essentially a mechanism by which certain genes
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:14.920]   regulate their activity.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.960]   This is a DNA binding of something called HSF-1.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.040]   We don't have to go too deep into the mechanism here
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:21.880]   or the nomenclature,
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.240]   but HSF stands for heat shock factor one,
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.240]   and HSF-1 binding to a particular location in the genome
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:36.140]   allowed for a different molecule with a very long name.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:37.320]   I'll just tell it to you for fun,
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:40.280]   but you can just let the numbers and letters stream by.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.120]   It's not important.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.360]   HNRNPA2B1 shortened to A2B1,
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.460]   which frankly is not that short to begin with.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.920]   A2B1 is still a name that should be meaningless
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.360]   to most everybody, but here's what's really cool.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:57.080]   A2B1 is directly involved in glucose and lipid metabolism
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.820]   and regulates the genes that control
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:01.720]   glucose and lipid metabolism.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.580]   So here we have a situation where local heating of skin
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.180]   converted a metabolically sluggish or inactive cell type,
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:13.180]   the white fat cell, into the metabolically charging,
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:15.960]   so to speak, beige fat cell,
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:18.340]   which in turn led to systemic,
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.700]   meaning body-wide increases in metabolism
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:21.780]   through two mechanism.
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:24.800]   One mechanism is this increase in UCP-1,
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.980]   which for those of you that want to know,
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:30.020]   UCP-1 causes shifts in the way that potential energy
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:33.340]   is pushed from the protons through the mitochondria,
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.900]   basically more mitochondrial function,
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.360]   which means more ATP, which means cells are more active,
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.480]   AKA increased metabolism,
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.140]   and increases in things like heat shock factor one
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:45.780]   and A2B1, which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:46.880]   and regulation.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.900]   So I want to be very clear.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:52.100]   This study does not say that spot reduction is possible
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.040]   with local heating of tissue.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.880]   I just can see it now that once this paper gets out
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:58.680]   into the press, people are going to say,
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:01.540]   oh, heating up a certain patch of skin is going to burn fat
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:04.540]   or convert fat to some other cell type at that location.
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:06.300]   Sorry, that's not the way it works.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:11.300]   They did observe increases in beige fat cells
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.560]   at certain locations in the body,
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.100]   but those increases in beige fat occurred
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.720]   where beige fat cells always reside,
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.400]   around the spine, the upper neck, the clavicles, and so on.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.220]   This is exciting because it provides
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:26.100]   yet another potential mechanism
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:28.740]   in addition to deliberate cold exposure
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:32.480]   to increase beige fat, meaning the metabolically active form
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.020]   of fat cell.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:36.520]   It also nicely provides a mechanism,
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.480]   or at least a potential mechanism for the observation
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:44.460]   that burn either small patch of skin being burned,
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:48.460]   or again, sadly, large patches of skin being burned,
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:53.460]   leading to these very extreme and very long lasting increases
[01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:56.540]   in body fat loss and metabolism.
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.900]   What, if anything, should you do with this information?
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:02.580]   Well, first of all, I want to very much caution people
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:05.060]   about putting anything so hot
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:08.180]   that it can damage the surface of your skin onto your skin.
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:10.020]   That would be a terrible idea.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:14.660]   However, I do predict a time not too far from now
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.000]   where people will start to explore
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.420]   the use of local skin heating
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:24.300]   as a means to increase the conversion of white to beige fat
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.580]   and in turn for beige fat stores
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.160]   to increase metabolism overall
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:31.640]   and maybe even improve glucose metabolism and thermogenesis.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.540]   If you'd like more details about this study,
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:37.020]   we will provide a link to it in the show notes caption.
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.740]   I should mention that the study,
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:41.460]   at least the portion of the study that was focused on humans
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:45.220]   involved roughly equal numbers of males and females.
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:47.780]   The subjects followed their normal daily schedule,
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.740]   including time and composition of meals, they say,
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:52.860]   or rest and active hours, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:55.820]   The local hyperthermia therapy was done in the following way.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:58.140]   Here I'm paraphrasing from their method section,
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.820]   the subjects were seated in upright posture.
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:03.360]   They were wearing a standard test robe
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.300]   with the head and neck and shoulders unclothed
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:08.180]   and one meter away from a thermal imaging camera,
[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:10.340]   which could basically measure the temperature
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:11.620]   at their skin surface to make sure
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:15.220]   that it remained constant across subjects and yet safe.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:18.900]   The supraclavicular fat deposits,
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:21.220]   meaning the upper shoulders and upper back area
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.940]   were exposed to this thermal source, again,
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:26.660]   41 degrees for 20 minutes, okay?
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.340]   So it was 41 degrees for 20 minutes
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:31.860]   and their core temperatures and skin temperatures
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:34.020]   were monitored before and after
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.900]   this local hyperthermic therapy.
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:39.140]   The subjects were exposed to this local hyperthermia therapy
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.180]   three days per week, separated by day,
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:42.400]   Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:46.300]   So they had weekends off for five weeks total
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.220]   after which their data were collected.
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.540]   And the study has a number of other
[01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:52.000]   really interesting features that are sure to lead
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.060]   to increased understanding of both mechanism
[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.860]   and new protocols, such as analysis of the genes
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:59.500]   and proteins that are activated downstream
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.380]   of this local hyperthermia therapy.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:03.500]   I find these data incredibly interesting,
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.580]   in part because of the ways that local hyperthermia therapy
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:09.280]   mimics deliberate cold exposure therapy,
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.540]   same downstream mechanisms, UCP1
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:13.420]   and some of the other pathways are involved.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:15.600]   And all of that points to a somewhat new,
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.960]   but certainly an important concept.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.760]   Many of you have probably heard of hormesis,
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:23.800]   which is the subjecting of oneself or others, I suppose,
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.260]   to enough stress to induce an adaptation of some kind.
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:29.740]   So hormesis is the reason why
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:32.400]   if you get into cold water repeatedly,
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:34.760]   at first it's very painful psychologically
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.300]   and over time you get used to it.
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:37.420]   You never get completely used to it,
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.700]   but you get more used to it.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.980]   Hormesis is also used to describe the adaptation
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:43.720]   to cardiovascular exercise
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.000]   or to the hard rep sets of resistance training
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.180]   and the growth of muscles or the strengthening of muscles
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:50.740]   or the improvement in cardiovascular function
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.980]   to endurance exercise and so forth.
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.100]   Hormesis is a somewhat common term nowadays.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.940]   If you haven't heard it, now you've heard it.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:01.180]   In this paper, they describe what is called mitohormesis,
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:02.720]   which is in essence,
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:05.660]   the fact that any number of different stressful stimuli,
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:07.900]   provided they activate UCP1
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:10.060]   and some of these other pathways that I just described,
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:13.780]   like HSF1, can induce changes in the mitochondria
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:16.340]   that lead to increases in metabolism.
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:20.260]   So it shouldn't surprise us that cold and heat
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:22.440]   can both lead to increases in metabolism
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:25.260]   and conversion of white fat to beige fat.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:28.800]   It shouldn't surprise us because both pathways are stress.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.920]   Local hyperthermia is stress.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.800]   Burn certainly is stress.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.480]   Sauna is a form of stress.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:38.320]   Deliberate cold exposure is a form of stress.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.760]   Exercise is a form of stress.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.360]   And the adaptation to those stressors is not infinite.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:46.520]   All of those protocols, any protocol for that matter,
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.660]   is going to be effective because it's going to converge
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:51.700]   on an existing internal biological mechanism.
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.200]   So there's no unique mechanism for each protocol.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.140]   Each protocol that I've talked about today,
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:58.900]   whether or not it's five minutes or 20 minutes
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:01.700]   or four times in a day or three times per week
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:04.520]   or seven times per week is tickling or pushing
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:07.480]   or stomping, if you will, on a given pathway
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:10.660]   and really activating it to a mild or to severe degree.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:12.800]   What I've tried to do today is to illustrate
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.160]   the general mechanisms by which heat in particular
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.420]   can activate certain biological pathways
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:20.360]   so that you can devise protocols
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.100]   that are going to be optimal for you and your needs.
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:24.940]   So just to briefly recap,
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:28.560]   if you want to get the greatest growth hormone increases,
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:33.120]   do sauna or other deliberate heat exposure fairly seldom.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:36.240]   Probably no more than once per week, maybe even less.
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.600]   And do it a lot that day.
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.780]   Just make sure that you break it up into multiple sessions.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:40.840]   In the study I described earlier,
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.560]   they did four sessions, 30 minutes each,
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.620]   but that was just once a week.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:49.080]   If you're interested in the cardiovascular benefits
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:51.600]   and the potential longevity benefits of sauna,
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.900]   well, then it's clear that doing it three to four,
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:55.140]   maybe even seven times per week
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:56.480]   is going to be more beneficial
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.840]   than doing it just one or three times per week.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.640]   It stands to reason that for those of you interested
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.120]   in the general health effects of sauna,
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:06.480]   about an hour per week broken up into three sessions
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.300]   makes the most sense based on my read of the data.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:12.020]   And again, that range of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:13.620]   is going to be your guide.
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:15.760]   And in terms of the mental health benefits,
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:18.220]   it seems that getting a little bit uncomfortable
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:20.980]   in that heat environment, sauna or otherwise,
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:23.540]   provided it's safe, is going to be the best way
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:25.460]   to access those mental health effects
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:29.340]   by way of increasing dynorphin, which as you recall,
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:32.240]   will then increase the ability of endorphin
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:34.260]   to have its positive effects on mood
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.260]   after you get out of the sauna
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:37.940]   or other deliberate heat exposure.
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:39.780]   And in terms of timing,
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:43.260]   after a workout of any kind, morning or afternoon,
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:46.140]   or if you're not doing it after a workout,
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:47.620]   certainly in the later part of the day
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:50.220]   is going to be most beneficial as it relates to sleep.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:51.800]   But of course, there's a caveat there,
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.200]   which I will mention again,
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.500]   which is that for those of you that have no trouble sleeping
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.340]   because you're exhausted
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:58.380]   or you're just one of these phenomenal sleepers,
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.780]   well then do it any time of day or night.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:02.860]   But for most people doing it later in the day
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:03.980]   is going to be more beneficial
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:06.940]   because of the post sauna cooling effect
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:10.660]   and the relationship between cooling by a degree or more
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.100]   as a way to enter sleep.
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:14.140]   Thank you for joining me today for my discussion
