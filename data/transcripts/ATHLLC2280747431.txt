[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.200]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.880]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.840]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.120]   and one of the areas I love optimizing the most is travel.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.520]   I've been to 60 plus countries,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.820]   and on every trip, I love meeting locals,
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.560]   understanding their culture, having unique experiences,
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.040]   and eating the best foods a place has to offer.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.200]   So, a few months back, I started doing episodes
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.580]   on top travel destinations,
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.000]   and the feedback I got from all of you was so positive,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm gonna keep it going.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.920]   And one country that's been on my list for years,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520]   but that I haven't made it to yet is Iceland.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.880]   I thought it was finally gonna happen
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.600]   when some close friends of ours got engaged
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.300]   and said their wedding was gonna be there,
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.040]   but it ended up being only a couple weeks
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.920]   after our youngest daughter was due, so it didn't happen.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.800]   But it's not just me that wants to go.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.320]   I've heard from so many of you
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.620]   that it's at the top of your lists as well,
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.080]   so I thought it would be a great place for an episode.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.740]   And funny enough, I already knew the perfect guest,
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.480]   Brandon Presser, who's joining me
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.040]   for his third appearance on the show
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.840]   after we did an episode on Japan just a few months back.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200]   Well, he's also an expert on Iceland.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.440]   When he was researching a guidebook he was writing,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.240]   he spent six months in the country
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.760]   and literally went everywhere.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.480]   I mean, every restaurant, every hotel, every fjordhead,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.820]   and every farm that had an extra bed.
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.200]   So when I say he knows the country,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.560]   he probably knows it better than most locals do,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.840]   and I am so excited to talk about when to go,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.520]   what to see and do, all the experiences to have,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.320]   and everything to eat and drink.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.480]   And then after we're done,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.800]   I'll cover how you might use your points and miles
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.520]   for your next trip to Iceland.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.000]   I am so excited for this one,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.080]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.120]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.840]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.680]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.800]   without our consent.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.760]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.720]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.560]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.120]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.240]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.080]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.240]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.480]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.800]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.760]   for this episode.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.720]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.840]   and remove your personal information
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.600]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.720]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.360]   and get that removed as well.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.320]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.680]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.200]   in their first two years.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.080]   And to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.000]   for their customers.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.560]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.600]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.120]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.080]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280]   - Brandon, thanks for being here.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.200]   - Thanks so much for having me again.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.240]   - You knew everything about Japan,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.120]   you know everything about Iceland.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.840]   There are even other countries you know everything about,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.360]   so I'll probably have you back.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.440]   But what is it about Iceland that makes it a kind of place
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.600]   that you would want to learn everything there is to know
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.440]   about the country?
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.360]   - I approach travel in thinking about a destination
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   qualitatively and quantitatively.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.000]   And so for me, doing Iceland was really, really rewarding
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.640]   when I was writing "The Lonely Planet Guide"
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.360]   because I would finish a trip like six, seven months
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.640]   in the country and I'd go, okay,
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.320]   I have actually seen everything.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.360]   I have been to every single place.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.920]   I have vetted everything that there is to do.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   There is no such thing as not found in the guidebook
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.880]   because if I didn't put it in, it's not worth doing.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.720]   And so there was a great amount of sort of
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.200]   quantitative satisfaction that I had seen everything
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.540]   and then I could kind of pivot to the quality
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.040]   and then troubleshoot exactly what a perfect trip
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.560]   for any type of traveler and any length of trip
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.400]   would be like.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.360]   - What is it about Iceland?
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.060]   What makes it so special?
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.480]   - Well, so I think on my first trip to Iceland,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.840]   I learned a lot of Icelandic words,
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.640]   which I think is important and we'll get to that soon.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   But one of my favorite words in Icelandic is kræma.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   Kræma means simmering and it's in two senses.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.720]   Kræma is simmering like the earth is shaking.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.480]   There's volcanoes erupting.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.700]   It's an active geological environment.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.760]   And then kræma, simmering as in creativity,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.880]   the spirit of the local people, the imagination they have,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.440]   the cool design, the music.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.840]   And I think those two things together,
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.100]   the nature and the culture,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.860]   make a place like you've never seen before.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.560]   - I've seen so many pictures and I don't know how somehow
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.080]   it's escaped our travel list for so long, which will change.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.880]   I'm sure by the end of this conversation,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.840]   I'm going to be going to book flights.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.240]   It's a small country.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.360]   You keep going back.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.680]   Does that mean that there's always something to find
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.120]   even though you've seen it all?
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.960]   - Definitely.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.680]   And I think one of the weird things about Iceland
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.480]   is that you can visit the same thing twice
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.840]   and have a really dramatically different experience.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.920]   So a good example of that would be a hike.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.760]   You know, even a one-hour hike along the coast,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.840]   you could do it at 11 p.m. in June
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   and you have the midnight sun
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.040]   and there's this eerie, quiet, good weather
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.460]   and you're with friends.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.520]   Or you could do it in the middle of winter
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   and it's stormy and brooding
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.620]   and you'll see the country in so many different ways
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.620]   and that weather and the vibe, it's always something new.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.120]   But then there's something else in Iceland
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.760]   that is sort of a big takeaway for me.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.280]   And a lot of what I learned in Iceland
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.320]   is something that I actually do in my regular life,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   which is Icelanders think of their lives in eras.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.000]   They don't think of graduating from college
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and taking on a job in a certain field
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.120]   and they're like, okay, that's it.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.240]   You know, like, I'm gonna be a lawyer
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.480]   for the rest of my life.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.880]   Icelanders have this notion of,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.640]   okay, I'm gonna own a restaurant
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.600]   'cause that's what I'm passionate about right now.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.200]   And five years later, they're like,
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.920]   you know what, I'm gonna get my teaching certificate
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.040]   because I really wanna teach elementary school.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.000]   And then seven years later,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.600]   they get interested in being an interior decorator
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.120]   and they open a design firm.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.960]   With such a small population
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.480]   and with such good social equality,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.040]   these things are possible.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.800]   And so I like to think of my trips to Iceland,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.680]   and I go all the time, as eras.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.000]   And every time I go back to Iceland,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.840]   I sort of reflect on myself.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.880]   What's changed in me, you know,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.720]   in the last year or since I've been there?
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.360]   And what era am I in?
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.160]   - How do we even start to think about this?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.080]   I haven't gone to Iceland,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.200]   so let's say I'm planning a trip
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.440]   or anyone's planning a trip.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.560]   It's a small country.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.520]   Does that mean it doesn't need
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.040]   the full kind of two weeks to give it justice?
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.760]   Is there too long of a trip, too short of a trip?
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.000]   - I would say that you can do any trip that you can.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.320]   It's worth doing.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.520]   And the first thing to remember
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.880]   is it's so close to the United States.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.520]   Of course, it's very close to Europe as well,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.160]   depending on where you're coming from.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.880]   But if all you have is four days,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.680]   we'll get through some planning ideas
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.160]   for the perfect four-day trip.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.680]   I mean, if you have 10 days, even better.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.920]   But I kind of want to challenge you
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.080]   to think of Iceland as a place
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.120]   that you can keep going back to.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.600]   I think a lot of Americans like to go back to Mexico,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.040]   even for a long weekend.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.880]   This can be a long weekend place
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.440]   that you can have six different versions
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.720]   of that long weekend and keep going back.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.200]   You know, Icelandair has a stopover program
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.160]   on the way to Europe.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.960]   So you can even tack on three nights in Iceland
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.040]   on the way to your trip to Paris for free,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.720]   or do it on the return.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.160]   So I think the big thing to start off with
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.760]   is that Reykjavik covers a huge amount
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.640]   of the population and urbanization in the country.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.120]   So Iceland has 390,000 people,
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.280]   240,000 of which live in the Reykjavik area.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.160]   And so if you're going to plan a trip,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.840]   you're definitely going to want to spend some time there.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.160]   And I would say the first thing to remember is
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.040]   if you're going to math your trip,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.720]   20 to 25% of your trip should be in Reykjavik
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.320]   and the rest should be out in nature.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.520]   And I think a lot of people do the opposite,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.520]   where they base themselves in Reykjavik
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.280]   and then do trips out into the nature.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.040]   You need to keep your time in Reykjavik
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.960]   to around that 20, 25%.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.360]   So a four day trip, do one night in Reykjavik.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.920]   You know, if you're doing a 10 day trip,
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.520]   two nights in Reykjavik.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.320]   Because you're really going for that mix
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.640]   of nature and culture,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.760]   but you're really just going to get like
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.560]   a tiny Scandinavian city
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.000]   if you base yourself in Reykjavik the whole time,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.200]   which isn't like huge value add.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.840]   - So one challenge I have is we have kids.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   Does that mean you're going to be staying
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.280]   one or two nights in a place, then move,
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.160]   then move, then move?
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.960]   Or when you say the other 75% of your trip,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.440]   could that be in one or two places in nature?
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.280]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.480]   We can jump right into what like a good
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.640]   four day trip would look like, if you want.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.120]   What you would do is you would land at Keflavik,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.480]   the international airport,
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.600]   which is a one hour drive from Reykjavik.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.920]   You'll pick up a car in Keflavik
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.720]   and you actually will drive in the other direction,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.560]   not to Reykjavik.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.600]   You'll drive to sort of Southwest Iceland
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.640]   to towns like Hetlar, Kossuthur,
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   and you'll set up there.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.240]   You get like an Airbnb, stay in a hotel,
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.960]   and base yourself there to do hikes
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.280]   and day trips out to waterfalls or horse farms
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.840]   or whatever you want to do.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.960]   And then as the trip comes to an end,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.440]   you'll drive into Reykjavik,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.320]   spend a night there, spend a day there,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.000]   and then head back to the airport.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.200]   If you have the means, sneak in a night
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.800]   at the Blue Lagoon Retreat, specifically Retreat,
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.000]   'cause it's absolutely unreal.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.720]   It's an amazing hotel.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.200]   Or get the spa package at the Retreat,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.640]   which gives you a day pass to this like private Blue Lagoon.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.600]   And then you head home on your flight from Keflavik.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.080]   That would be the perfect trip.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.280]   - So we did jump ahead a little bit.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.880]   Let's rewind a little and just like,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.600]   Iceland is a place where you can go and be very cold,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.800]   or you can go and have sun 24 hours a day.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.400]   How do you even think about when to start planning a trip?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.200]   Is there an ideal season?
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.000]   Is it different depending on what you want to do?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.040]   - So if you're thinking about it
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.200]   in terms of wanting a lot of daylight,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   the solstice in June is gonna have 24 hours of daylight.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.360]   And when you read a lot about Iceland,
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.800]   a lot of online sources get it wrong.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.480]   They say June, July, August.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.560]   But if you're doing the math
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.760]   and you're actually thinking about the sun,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.240]   if it's kind of mid late June that has the most sun,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.080]   then it's May and July that have the second most sun.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.560]   So if you want all of that daylight,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.720]   I would look at doing warm weather during the summer.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.520]   Best hiking is July and August
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   when practically every pass and every road is open
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.560]   because the weather has warmed.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.040]   If you're just looking for that daylight,
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.120]   think maybe May because you're not really
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.960]   in the highest of high season.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.600]   But in the way that people know
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.400]   the glory of the midnight sun and all of that good stuff,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.440]   they think that there's basically darkness
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.720]   for the rest of the year.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.280]   But I love going in March and October.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.200]   So for example, March 1st,
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.160]   you have the sun coming up at around 8, 8.30 a.m.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.360]   And the sun goes down at like 6.30, 6.45.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.120]   You still get a full day of daylight
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.720]   and you get some glow on the horizon
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.280]   and you get no tourists really relative to the summer.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.160]   And the same goes for October.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.880]   I think I probably prefer October a little bit more
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.400]   because you have more green from the summer
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.320]   before the snow cover.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.600]   March tends to be a little bit more brown.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.400]   So if you want those perfect photos,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.800]   October would be my ideal time to go.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.480]   And I'm actually gonna go this October
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.840]   and I kind of regret telling everyone
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.880]   that it's the best time to go
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.440]   because now it's gonna be overloaded
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.560]   and my hotels are gonna be expensive.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.880]   - Well, you just gotta book it quick.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.720]   - Exactly.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.960]   - Or you probably know everyone.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.120]   But what about the winter?
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.880]   Is there a case to be made
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.440]   to go visit Iceland in December or January?
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.480]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.720]   Much in the way that the Danes
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.680]   have commoditized this idea of hygge,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.040]   this coziness that is so cozy
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.560]   it's sort of impossible to describe.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.640]   The Icelanders embrace that as well.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.640]   And if you're looking for a cozy, more romantic holiday
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.800]   where you're snuggled up in a cabin
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.000]   or you wanna embrace cafe culture in Reykjavik,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.600]   you can certainly go in the dead of winter.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.400]   Your experience then will be
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.200]   a little more culturally heavy than it will
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.040]   being out in nature
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.120]   because it's not that Iceland's really cold.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.360]   So I grew up in Ottawa in Canada
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   and that is proudly the coldest capital in the entire world.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.600]   You would think Reykjavik would be colder by temperature.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.440]   It's the wind in Iceland
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.000]   that makes hiking and traveling really difficult.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.640]   And the wind can be there in June.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.400]   It can ruin a hike on the warmest of days.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.600]   - So that's kind of when to go.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   Before we go into places,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.480]   you talked a little bit about the vibe and the experience,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.680]   but what's the culture like?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.520]   What are people like?
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.360]   Are people friendly?
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.520]   Can you get to know them?
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.080]   How would you describe culture in Iceland?
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.960]   - I think our first cultural touchpoint
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.640]   for a lot of people is Bjork or Bjork.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.000]   And she brings this weirdness, right?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.440]   The swan dress and all of this kind of stuff.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.800]   And she is certainly a character,
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.960]   but there is something about her
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.280]   that you find in a lot of Icelanders,
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.520]   which is this uninhibited creativity.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.360]   There is no shame in pursuing your passions.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   And you find that a lot of people are artists
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.400]   in some capacity or have this propensity
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.280]   towards the creative.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.680]   And it can be really refreshing how it's expressed
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.040]   in a cool haircut or people designing their own jewelry.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.880]   There's no fear of being judged.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.040]   But on the other hand, there's this scandy coldness.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.320]   You don't get that effusive American-ness.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.080]   Hi, how are you?
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.200]   We never really mean hi, how are you when we say it,
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.120]   'cause you're supposed to answer good, how are you,
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.760]   and not actually answer.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.840]   So it's not weird to get a very one line,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.960]   hi, how are you, and an Icelander will say, good.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.440]   And it doesn't mean they're not friendly.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.200]   When you start befriending Icelanders,
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   their genuineness, their loyalty, and their care,
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.760]   I mean, it's like no other place on earth.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.400]   - How do you go about doing that if you walk into a bar
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.520]   and you're like, hey, how's it going?
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.000]   It's like, good.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.600]   Is it just pushing through it?
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.440]   What's your tips there
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.840]   for people who want to experience that warmth?
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.040]   - So I actually wrote a section
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.320]   in one of my Lonely Planet guides
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.520]   about how to blend in Reykjavik,
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.280]   because it's just so painfully obvious
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.120]   who's a tourist and who's not.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.040]   And you have to remember, right,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.680]   there's almost 400,000 people in Iceland,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.640]   and last year there were 1.7 million visitors.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   So if you just took six random people in Iceland,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.040]   five of them are gonna be visitors.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.320]   So it's this huge onslaught of people
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.480]   who are not from there.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.080]   One of the things that Icelanders love
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.280]   is swearing in English.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.880]   They will talk amongst each other in Icelandic,
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.880]   but they will say with a very aspirated Icelandic accent,
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.120]   like, fuck, like a lot.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.600]   And so if you can meet them at that obsessive swearingness,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   it'll actually endear the conversation.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.440]   I think learning a few Icelandic words
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.680]   also really helps.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.720]   Everyone speaks English at this point,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   but showing some local courtesy will really go a long way.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.600]   And I think getting out of Reykjavik
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.760]   and going into smaller towns,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.620]   it's a lot easier to make local friends there,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.880]   because by virtue of Reykjavik having a lot of locals,
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.740]   it also has a lot of tourists,
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.040]   a lot of the hotels are there,
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.360]   but when you're off in the smaller town,
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.240]   like Húsavík or Akureyri or Eylsæs,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.280]   you'll meet people a lot faster,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.400]   'cause they're like, who are you?
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.640]   This is a town of 700 people.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.020]   I've never seen your face.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.320]   - You said local courtesies.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.760]   Are there any cultural norms to be aware of
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.680]   when it comes to etiquette or things to do
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.880]   or not to do in Iceland?
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.960]   - One of the big things is because it's so windy,
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.300]   like I said, never carry an umbrella.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.960]   And Iceland has pretty bad weather on the whole.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.920]   Like a friend of mine from Iceland
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.240]   actually texted me this morning a picture of snow
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.080]   and was like, this is what's going on here
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.760]   one day away from May, but never carry an umbrella
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.800]   because the wind will just tear it to shreds.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.560]   So if you ever see someone walking down the street
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.880]   in Reykjavik with an umbrella,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.040]   you know that they're not from there.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.880]   Another thing is there's a lot of stray cats in Reykjavik.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.840]   If you have a funny comment about loving cats
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.600]   or knowing about the stray cats,
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.000]   that's absolutely a thing.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.480]   And a lot of people at Reykjavik also refer
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.360]   to sections of town by the zip code.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.480]   So central Reykjavik is 101.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.640]   So people are like, oh, where are you staying?
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.080]   If you try to like say the cross street,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.000]   that's not what it is.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.880]   You say, oh, I'm staying in 104.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.480]   Or like, make sure you know the zip code,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.000]   the postal code of where you're staying.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.400]   'Cause it's like these little things that will signify
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.200]   that you're not like a total noob.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.120]   - Even if you are.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.960]   - Even if you are.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.920]   - Okay, so I'm ready to start planning.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.880]   You've sold me.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.320]   What are some of the real highlights
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.720]   that someone needs to make sure to include on any trip?
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.840]   And then let's talk about,
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.200]   you talked a little bit about four days,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.880]   but let's talk about planning like a week or 10 days.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.640]   - Okay, so to give you a sense of Iceland's size,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.840]   it's about the size of Ohio,
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.840]   but you're never going to drive through Iceland
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.920]   in the middle, you know, the sort of Cincinnati,
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.080]   Columbus, Cleveland, Chevron.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.440]   You're never going to drive that.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.800]   Instead, you're going to have to drive
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.480]   the circumference of the island.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.640]   And there's a very aptly named road called the Ring Road.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.280]   And a lot of people set their sights on the Ring Road
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.680]   when they want to visit.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.880]   And I think if you were to complete the Ring Road
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   without stopping, I think it would take about 17 hours.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.440]   And so a lot of people think,
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.720]   okay, I'm going to do this in like five days.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.040]   Like I'll drive five hours a day,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.720]   look at cool things out the window,
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.000]   stop every once in a while for a cool thing.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.840]   I wouldn't attempt the Ring Road unless you have 10 days.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.240]   And I probably wouldn't even plan it
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.560]   so that you were moving like two hours
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.440]   and then a night, two hours and then a night.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.400]   I would actually try to book two nights
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.000]   every time you stop,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.160]   so that it doesn't feel like a total slog.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.800]   And while you will see beautiful things out the window
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.560]   on the Ring Road and all the car accidents
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.880]   in Iceland happen because people see something so beautiful
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.120]   that they slow down,
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.240]   not realizing someone's right behind them.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.760]   But you really need to get off the Ring Road.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.680]   All of the best stuff are all along the detours.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.600]   And so giving you the luxury of time
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.560]   will definitely give you the opportunity
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.960]   to see those cool things.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.960]   And I would even challenge you to do a different loop
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.680]   and mix it up and just look at looping
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.520]   along the West.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.320]   So that would be going from the airport
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.400]   up through Reykjavik, all the way through West Iceland,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   the Snæfellsnes Peninsula,
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   all the way up into the West fjords,
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.440]   which are kind of like those lobster claws
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.520]   that are like snipping off the side of Iceland,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.000]   going through all those fjords all the way up there.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.400]   And then coming back down past Reykjavik,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.200]   there's a different way that you could come down
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.560]   so you're not doubling back on anything you've done.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.400]   And that would be an incredible Ring Road alternate
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.120]   that very, very few people do.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.640]   So those would be like the two big driving itineraries
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.560]   that I would put forward.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.080]   Of course, if you have two weeks or three weeks,
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.040]   it's just the more time that you get to marinate
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.200]   in these incredible destinations.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.920]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.760]   I get it.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.440]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.320]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.400]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.320]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.280]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.000]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.800]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.640]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.080]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.040]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.520]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.600]   that you got through another week.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.720]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.280]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.040]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.160]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.800]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.360]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.400]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.240]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.280]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.920]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.400]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.480]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.340]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.360]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.600]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.180]   I love keeping my life and work organized,
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.880]   and I really don't think there's a better tool
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.280]   than Notion to do all that,
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.620]   which is why I am so excited to partner with them
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.680]   for this episode.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.660]   We use Notion to track all of our family and house projects,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.840]   plan trips, and even write down questions
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.520]   to ask our pediatrician during our next visit.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.840]   And then for all the hacks,
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.360]   it's where I plan everything.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.280]   Podcast episodes, newsletters, upcoming guests,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.000]   this book I'm working on, and so much more.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.880]   I really don't know what I'd do without Notion,
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.260]   but fortunately that's a question
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.500]   I don't spend much time thinking about.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.480]   But now Notion has gotten even better
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.680]   as I continue to use Notion AI all the time.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.360]   For example, on the personal front,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.720]   we've used Notion AI to brainstorm places
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.120]   we could go for a family trip
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.560]   and even write up itinerary ideas.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.520]   And on the work front,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.520]   it's helped me brainstorm episode ideas
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.360]   and turn lots of messy notes
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.160]   into something much more polished.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.820]   And it just keeps getting better.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.760]   I can definitely tell you that Notion AI
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.600]   helps me work faster, write better,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.120]   and do things that normally take hours in just seconds.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.240]   And the best part, for a limited time,
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.080]   you can try Notion AI free
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.240]   when you go to notion.com/allthehacks.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.960]   That's all lowercase letters,

[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.720]   And when you use our link, you're supporting the show.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.240]   This is a limited time offer.

[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.960]   at notion.com/allthehacks.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.600]   I can kind of go through each region very quick
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.800]   and how Icelanders kind of see it.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.200]   So you have the capital area, which is Reykjavik,
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.840]   and they have the suburb, Kopavogur,
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.240]   and then Hafnarfjörður,
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.080]   which is like a little town nearby.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.960]   So that greater region is very urbanized,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.960]   a ton to do, bars, clubs, big restaurants,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.200]   big, cool hotels.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.040]   That's where you're gonna get your fix of that.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.640]   And then right outside the capital region
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.760]   is what you may have heard, the Golden Circle.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.800]   This is strictly a tourism product that was created
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.160]   so that people could have a really fun day trip
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.320]   outside of the city.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.380]   And basically that touches on three geological features.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.480]   One is a big geyser called Geysir,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.120]   which is where the word geyser comes from.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.240]   And then Guttfoss, which is Golden Waterfall.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.840]   And then Thingvellir,
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.080]   which is where the old parliament was
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.160]   and where actually the continental plates
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.120]   are cracking open.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.880]   So you get these three really cool things.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.840]   It's like a four-hour experience.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.680]   It's a totally fake thing.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.600]   And you could certainly drive through it
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.280]   on your way to something else.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.600]   What's sort of exciting is just beyond that,
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.600]   Blue Lagoon is actually opening a brand new second resort
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.920]   up there.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.400]   It's just about to open.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.880]   So that's really exciting and will kind of change the flow
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.920]   of how people are moving through that Golden Circle.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.240]   But the thing to remember,
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.720]   and before I kind of like quickly touch on the regions,
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.320]   is that there's no such thing as like the waterfall
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.640]   that you have to see.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.280]   You can hike anywhere in Iceland
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.080]   and it's absolutely beautiful.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.320]   And there's waterfalls that you think you'll have discovered
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.400]   because there's no tourists there.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   So I would kind of stay away from the Instagram version
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   of Iceland that has prioritized really random places
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.480]   like this waterfall or this gorge or this fjord
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.560]   and keep things a little bit more up in the air.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.640]   I'm gonna like do it clockwise.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.880]   So you're leaving Reykjavik.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.560]   The West has a few small towns
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.840]   and this very famous Snæfellsnes Peninsula
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.760]   with a glacier all the way at the tip.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.120]   And this is where Journey to the Center of the Earth,
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.440]   the Jules Verne book actually takes place.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.280]   It's beautiful.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.120]   There's a lot of hot springs, horse farms.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.360]   You can do a loop of the peninsula
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.040]   and it could be its own sort of Golden Circle
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.520]   in its own right.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.280]   A lot of the sagas.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   So Iceland's very rich history that's detailed
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.880]   in these very sort of Dickensian, like Shakespearean,
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.720]   he killed this person and that person,
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.440]   revenge killed that person.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.320]   A lot of that takes place in the West.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.240]   Then beyond the West, you go up to the Westfjords,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.400]   which I mentioned earlier.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.040]   This is my absolute favorite region in Iceland.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.720]   This is Iceland on steroids.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.440]   The fjords are fjordier.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.320]   Everything's like really dramatic.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.120]   The waterfalls are huge.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.720]   There's some like abandoned herring factories
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.160]   that have been turned into cool places to stay.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.960]   Like it's just totally unreal up there.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.720]   The best time to visit is July and August for that region
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.920]   because it can be a little bit trickier
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.800]   to get through some of the roads.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.480]   There's a lot of road closures in the off season.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.720]   But if you are going in the peak of summer,
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.520]   I would devote all of my energy and go up to the Westfjords.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.600]   I absolutely love it up there
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.440]   and try to get there as much as I can,
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.840]   even though it's pretty far out of the way.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.320]   For what it's worth, for anyone listening,
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.440]   I just pulled up Google Maps while Brandon's talking
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.000]   so I could like kind of just track where you are.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.720]   Are we on like the North side?
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.920]   What are some towns so I can make sure
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.760]   I'm in the right place?
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.560]   So each region has their main town.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.160]   So the West is Borganes and Stikisomers.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.280]   Those are the two kind of main towns.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.280]   And then up in the Westfjords, you have Isafjordur.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.120]   That would be if you were to want to fly domestically,
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.120]   and we'll talk about kind of flying
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.520]   to kind of cheat some time off of your itinerary,
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.760]   you would fly into Isafjordur
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.800]   and then you could rent a car there
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.840]   and kind of drive around all of those fjords up there.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.440]   And there's a really famous waterfall.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.000]   Not to go against what I just said
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.800]   about not coveting certain waterfalls,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   but while everyone is kind of going gaga
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.840]   over the good fuss in the Golden Circle,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.360]   there's Dinyandi waterfall
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.560]   that looks like an actual perfect Bundt cake.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.360]   It looks like an AI generated a photo of it.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.160]   It's totally unreal.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.840]   There's some really, really, really cool towns up there
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.240]   that have 50 people, 200 people, all with places to stay.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.720]   And it really just feels like you're on the end of the Earth.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.200]   So then going across,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.640]   so now you're kind of at midnight on the clock,
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.800]   is the whole northern stretch of Iceland.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.360]   And the big city in that region is Akureyri.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.120]   And Akureyri is the second city of Iceland.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.800]   And to tell you how much smaller it is than Reykjavik,
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.720]   Akureyri has like 20,000 people on a good day.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.440]   But it's really charming
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.760]   because it's the biggest city in the area.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.360]   So there's like all these cafes and there's a bookstore
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.240]   and there are these restaurants.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.160]   But when you're driving into the city,
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   you can see it in its entirety.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.520]   It's so tiny.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.080]   There's something really charming about it
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.320]   when people have a lot of northern pride
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.960]   because so many of the rest of the people in the country
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.720]   live down in Reykjavik.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.680]   So just beyond Akureyri, there's Mivat,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.360]   which Mivat actually translates to fly water
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.400]   because there's a lot of flies in the spring
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.560]   when everything blooms.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.600]   But in the summer, it's absolutely stunning.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.000]   But that whole area has had a lot of
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.840]   ancient volcanic activity
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.200]   and there's some really cool formations to check out.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.760]   And then Húsavík is like a college town nearby,
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.200]   like a really young, cool vibe,
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.560]   best place in Iceland to go whale watching in season.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.320]   You can go out and see dozens of whales.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.920]   Really cool town to spend some time in.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.080]   And then you kind of go along to the east,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.640]   so, you know, like three o'clock,
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.840]   and those fjords are really thin and jagged
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.800]   and kind of have a similar vibe to the West fjords.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.880]   Some really extreme mountains meeting water,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.960]   some really cool little towns.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.520]   And then, you know, you kind of come around to Skaftafell,
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.440]   which is like a really cool geological formation.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.560]   The glacial lagoon, which you might have seen on Instagram.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.440]   And then you have the black sand beaches in the south
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.680]   and that crawls all the way back again
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.280]   to that golden circle area.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.880]   - You went through the whole south pretty fast.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.520]   Is that kind of maybe something
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.000]   that's often left off an itinerary or?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.720]   - So the south is extremely popular
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.360]   because it's super easy to get to
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.520]   and the roads are always clear and really flat
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.560]   because of a lot of northern weather
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.840]   will hit the highlands of Iceland and dissipate.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.120]   So you'll get rain,
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.640]   but you might not get as like extreme winds
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.440]   or things that would close a road.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.520]   So I find like a lot of people on short itineraries
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.640]   will kind of do that Southern area.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.080]   Vík, which is about halfway, kind of six o'clock.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.520]   Vík is kind of the farthest point
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.240]   a lot of people go on a short trip.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.600]   And then everything that's sort of West of Vík
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.000]   are the stuff that people explore.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.440]   So there's like a really good waterfall at Skóðr
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.760]   and you can do some really cool hiking around Skóðr.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.680]   And my favorite hike in all of Iceland
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   is actually from Skóðr up over where that big eruption was
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.240]   about 12 years ago.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.600]   And then you land down into a valley called Þarsmörk
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.000]   between three glaciers.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.120]   The weather is always like pretty good in Þarsmörk
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.520]   because it's protected by glaciers.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.960]   And that hike is called Fimvardals.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.960]   It takes a whole day to do.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.280]   I would definitely recommend having a guide
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.320]   take you to do it.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.560]   It takes like 10 hours.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.360]   Then you end up in Þarsmörk for the night
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.800]   and you could spend a night in Þarsmörk
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.080]   and then arrange to be picked up
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   and driven back out to the ring road again.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.640]   - That brings up a good point, guides.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.440]   Is that something that if you're going to Iceland,
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.760]   you're like you probably should organize
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.920]   a lot of guides and trips or can you do this all on your own
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.720]   except maybe a few things like what you just mentioned?
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.680]   - Well, the one thing that a lot of people do
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.800]   is they get in trouble when they take
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.000]   their little Yaris car on an F road.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.600]   So F roads are F for Fjall, which means mountain.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.000]   And it is strictly prohibited to drive your rental car
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.960]   unless you have like a chonky SUV four-wheel drive,
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.520]   but it will say like in a sticker in the vehicle
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.440]   whether or not that car can go on an F road.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.000]   You will know.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.880]   And in the times that I've driven by broken cars on F roads
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.960]   because a tourist thought they were superhuman
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.800]   and thought they could do it.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.040]   I mean, if I had a nickel,
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.800]   I would honestly be a millionaire.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.120]   So you need a guide for that.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:20.000]   I wouldn't want to try to get a car across a small river
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.920]   and having it swept away.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.160]   If you really want to get into the highlands,
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.560]   go to places like Thorsmark
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.000]   or have that kind of rewarding experience,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.600]   I would absolutely hire a guide.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.520]   I would also hire a guide because like I said,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.080]   you don't have to be precious about the exact trail to hike
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.560]   or the exact gorge to check out or waterfall.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.480]   And what a guide will do is a lot of them
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.320]   have significant training and they're going to know,
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.480]   okay, the weather is coming in from the West.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.760]   So we were going to hike in the West,
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.680]   but today we'll hike Eastward.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.360]   We'll have beautiful skies and a chance of Northern lights
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.400]   and they'll switch it up.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.080]   And they'll know because they have that experience
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.680]   from growing up in rural Iceland, what the weather is doing.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.720]   And they'll just optimize your hike.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.040]   Like you don't have to put on your rain coat
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.920]   and have terrible wind just to say
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.360]   that you walked from A to B.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.760]   Your guide will give you the exact same experience
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.800]   that you didn't even know existed
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.400]   by walking you from C to D.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.720]   That's the value.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.040]   - Any tips for finding these guides to get a good one
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   or is it easy?
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.720]   - Iceland's so small and there are a lot
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.000]   of tourism businesses and I don't necessarily
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.600]   want to prioritize one over the other
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.160]   because it's such a tiny place.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.520]   But I will shout out one of my favorite groups
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.120]   on the island, Midgard Adventures.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.640]   They're just such a cool group of people.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.520]   They're all really young.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.400]   They're in their late 20s and 30s
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.600]   and they have just like this incredible spirit about them.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.280]   And they really vibe with this,
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.800]   like we're not just gonna take you to this thing
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.560]   because you saw it on Instagram.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.080]   We're gonna give you a whole experience.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.640]   But like it's not weird to end up at one of their houses
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.120]   at the end of the day because you guys were like bonding
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.520]   over some really cool music and you go and like listen
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.000]   to records at their house and like their mom cooks for you
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.880]   or something like that.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.360]   I just love them so much.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.520]   I remember the first time that I was in Iceland
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.080]   like 18 years ago, I met some of those guys
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.840]   when they were like teenagers
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.760]   and now they're married with kids.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.120]   I just really respect what they're doing.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.880]   There's a lot of people doing cool stuff like that
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.280]   but it's been fun to like watch them over the years.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.560]   - And you mentioned Northern Lights.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.000]   If that's on someone's bucket list,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.800]   like I wanna see them somewhere, somehow in the world,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.680]   is tacking that on in Iceland a good time to do it?
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.360]   - Yeah, so we're actually about to enter
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.640]   the era of solar maximum for Northern Lights
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.880]   and basically what that means is the sun is sort of on a,
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.040]   it's like an 11 year cycle of how it's producing flares.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.000]   So we're coming into solar maximum
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.160]   which is supposed to be in 2024
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.280]   but you don't have to be in full maximum
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.000]   to have great Northern Lights.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.520]   So they're gonna be great this year.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.440]   So there's three ingredients that you need
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.280]   for Northern Lights.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.120]   You need flares, you need darkness
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.720]   and you need a lack of clouds.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.640]   A lot of people are gonna try to sell you
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   on a Northern Lights tour.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.480]   It's completely bogus.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.440]   You don't have to pay all this money
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.200]   to have someone drive you out into the wilderness.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.560]   You can do it yourself 'cause you're just looking up.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.080]   And if you're gonna follow that 4D itinerary
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.120]   we were talking about where you're gonna go base yourself
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.960]   in the wilderness in a rural part of Iceland
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.440]   for the majority of your trip,
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.400]   you can just look out the window.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.600]   But I've also seen amazing Northern Lights
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.400]   in downtown Reykjavik.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.560]   'Cause when they're good, they're good.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   There's a website that gives you Intel IS, V-E-D-U-R.IS.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.640]   It gives you Intel and a score
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.840]   on what the flares are gonna be doing that night.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.760]   And it'll also tell you how much cloud cover
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.880]   there's gonna be.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.160]   So you can kind of make a judgment.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.000]   I think the scale goes to nine, but a four is good.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.320]   Like if you get a four, you're like,
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.760]   "Okay, I'm gonna see some Northern Lights.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.560]   If it's clear, the conditions have to be correct."
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.920]   So because you need darkness,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.200]   you would think December and January
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.720]   are actually the best months, but it's not true.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.720]   Where all the factors kind of collide the best
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.640]   is sort of in that March and October range.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.440]   So you're gonna get all that daylight during the day
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   and then you're gonna get maximum Northern Light potential.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.480]   I just wouldn't fall into the trap
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.720]   of needing to pay someone $150
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.760]   for them to drive you somewhere
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.640]   when you have a car and you could ask
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.000]   the hotel you're staying at,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.160]   like where is a particularly dark place to go.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.000]   If you're in Reykjavik,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.560]   just drive an hour out of the city on the South Coast.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.160]   The best Northern Lights I've seen are in that area.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.680]   - We didn't talk too much about transportation,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.480]   but it sounds like everyone needs a car.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.200]   - Yeah, if you're going in the dead of winter
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.720]   and you just kind of want to be cozy in a cabin
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.520]   or you just want to be cozy in Reykjavik
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.640]   and kind of bop around,
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.560]   like you could certainly land in Keflavik
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.200]   and then take the bus.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.440]   The buses run all the time
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.200]   and they're like coach buses.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.720]   They don't feel like a public bus
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.120]   that you might find in a city in the US
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.800]   and then you will get to your hotel
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.280]   and you can kind of have your low key experience in the city.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   But yeah, I would absolutely rent a car.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.000]   It just really maximizes your ability
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.160]   to get out into nature
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.560]   'cause that's why you're there, right?
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.400]   Nature and culture.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.600]   - Any tips on cars?
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.160]   I mean, you mentioned not all of them
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.360]   can go on certain roads.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.280]   Is there something you'd be like,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.680]   this is what you should be opting for
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.640]   or steer clear of all the US chains,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.960]   like focus on local or anything like that?
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.080]   - There was this really funny era in Iceland
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.960]   about 10 years ago when they got a surplus of Yaris's.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.320]   They were so omnipresent everywhere.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.960]   You'd pull up to an attraction
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.560]   and there would just be 86 Yaris's lined up in a row
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.840]   that locals were calling tourists Yaris's.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.200]   They're like, oh, there's another Yaris.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.160]   And it's diversified since.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.160]   When you get the four wheel drive,
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.240]   you get the opportunity to drive on the mountain roads.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.840]   So it gives you more accessibility.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.320]   They are significantly more expensive as a result.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.400]   And if you don't have any experience
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.920]   using four wheel drives on those roads,
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.760]   this is not the time to start.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.960]   So my instinct would actually be
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.040]   to get an affordable vehicle
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.440]   so that it can get you around.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.640]   You know, if you're gonna rent that Airbnb
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.480]   out in Kvassar and you're gonna wanna drive
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.120]   to a cool restaurant nearby and drive to do a few things,
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   do that and then save your money to splurge on a guide.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.080]   And that guide will likely come with their own vehicle
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.680]   and take you up into the mountains
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.520]   or up into places where you don't really know
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.000]   where you're going and it's not the time
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.680]   to try to figure it out.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.560]   - While we're on transportation, you mentioned flights.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.480]   Is that something people should be thinking about
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.560]   if they have limited time or everything's small enough
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.200]   that is it really just kind of like a luxury
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.880]   that's not necessary?
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.880]   - So one of my ideas for an alternate long weekend
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.120]   is instead of picking up that car at Keflavik Airport,
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.160]   driving to the south and doing this ring with Reykjavik,
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.480]   if you've done that or if you just wanna be in a place
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.960]   that is less expensive, what I would actually do
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.560]   is take a domestic flight to Akureyri.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.680]   So you land, then you're gonna get on a very short
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.200]   domestic flight to Akureyri in the north
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.020]   and you're gonna do your own circle up there.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.000]   So it's gonna be Akureyri, Mivat and Husevik
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.740]   and you're getting a lot of really cool stuff up there.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:45.240]   The internal flight, the round trip to get up there
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.640]   and back to the international airport
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.080]   is gonna be about $140.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.480]   And that cost is immediately defrayed
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.840]   by virtue of all the accommodation
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   being so much cheaper up there
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.600]   because it's less in demand.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   So it ends up working out in the wash to be free
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.480]   and you're gonna have a lot less tourists up there
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.880]   than you would in the capital area.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.840]   And it comes with a little bit more bragging rights
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.120]   where you're up in this like much farther place,
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.880]   you're still gonna get your little taste of culture
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.440]   in Akureyri, the little big city of Iceland,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.160]   but has all the things that the capital region has
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.040]   and that Southwest Iceland has,
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.960]   like the really cool hot springs
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.160]   and it has the spas and really great hiking
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.400]   and really cool horse ranches.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.200]   It's just gonna be way less tourists
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.320]   and way more opportunities to connect with locals.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.200]   - That sounds awesome.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.080]   And I assume you could still go rent a car there
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.280]   and do all those things.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.100]   - Oh, totally.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.080]   There's a car rental right at the Akureyri airport.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:47.920]   - Cool.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.040]   So we've kind of talked about a lot of regions.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.880]   Let's kind of zoom in to the capital for a little bit
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.320]   'cause I know it's probably going to be a home base
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.160]   for everyone.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.060]   If someone's looking to have a food nightlife experience,
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.360]   that's probably the place to do it.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.880]   Though I imagine you can eat anywhere in Iceland,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.840]   of course, people eat wherever they live.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.400]   But let's talk about it a little bit.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.240]   - Totally.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.160]   Okay, so we'll start with accommodation.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:14.080]   I have a really tricky feeling about Reykjavik
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   because the city center becomes a bit of a tourist town
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.800]   a lot of people Airbnb their apartments.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.920]   There's a lot of hotels that have gone up.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.560]   It can be pretty intense.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.540]   And there's a part of me that gets a little bit sad
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.880]   because it's supposed to be a city for locals.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.960]   And then it becomes this hub.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.720]   For me, I like to pick a hotel when I'm in Reykjavik
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.760]   instead of an Airbnb.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.000]   And that's because it's kind of like that Barcelona thing
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.680]   where there were too many Airbnbs
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.620]   and suddenly the city had no soul.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.620]   And I wanna put my money into a hotel in Reykjavik
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:58.680]   because I believe that to be more culturally sustainable
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.480]   and it keeps zoning a little bit better.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.800]   The price of an Airbnb is so high in Reykjavik
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.080]   that you're not really getting a huge value
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.680]   in picking an Airbnb over a hotel.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.600]   A lot of the Airbnbs are really small
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.360]   or they're just like a room in someone's house.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.480]   And I appreciate having a family
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.120]   and needing two bedrooms or something like that.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.300]   You'll find all of that out in the countryside.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.040]   There's summer houses and like cool Airbnbs to rent
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.520]   that fit families all over Iceland in the countryside.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.800]   I would stick to hotels in Reykjavik
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.680]   for a price reason and a cultural sustainability reason.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.420]   Now, as far as picking things to eat,
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.960]   if we go back to that idea of eras before,
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.280]   a restaurant could be wildly successful
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.800]   and the chef could just be like,
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.180]   you know what, now I wanna be a school teacher.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.720]   I'm gonna close my restaurant.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.680]   So the shelf life of eating establishments in Reykjavik
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.280]   is a lot shorter than I would like it to be,
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.220]   especially when I was writing guidebooks
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.040]   and I needed them to stay open
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.960]   so that my guidebook would stay relevant.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   So the best resource in my opinion is Grapevine.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.040]   It's the local paper, all of it's online.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.320]   They've done a great job for years and years
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.200]   and they're totally tapped into the community.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.840]   On their website, they have a best of list
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.040]   and I love all of their recommendations.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.320]   Like I always wholeheartedly agree with their point of view.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.440]   Some of my personal favorites that have been around
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   for quite a long time are Fish Market, Fish Company,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.120]   Dill, which is just like a great restaurant
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.600]   if you're celebrating something.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.280]   It's sort of a cut above and just really wonderful.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.080]   Ox is really cool.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.280]   It used to lurk in the back of another restaurant
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.800]   and now it's opened in its own space.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.560]   And then the cafe culture side, Reykjavik Roasters,
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.880]   they're everywhere now.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.120]   It started as one spot, there's a few locations.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.240]   Great stuff, great places to sit and hang out.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.000]   But I really like Cactus Espresso Bar
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.760]   and all my friends in Iceland are talking
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.120]   about this new place that's opening called Anna Jónas
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.440]   that is getting a lot of buzz.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.760]   And I'm really excited to go check that place out
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.880]   when I go back.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.200]   The other thing also on the food side
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.040]   is not to snub fast food.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.240]   Icelanders love their American style fast food
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.720]   and their candy.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.520]   So you gotta get a hot dog.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.920]   And when you order the hot dog, ask for it Einar með öll,
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.400]   which means one with everything.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.800]   And it comes with like crunchy, like Funyun-y things on top.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.120]   And that's a must.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.680]   It's like, you know, drunk food at three in the morning
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.840]   after you've been out at the bars.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.840]   Because Icelanders sort of covet American style fast food
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.960]   or the way that we're doing food,
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.400]   food halls are really trendy right now.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.360]   There's just food halls everywhere.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.480]   When Iceland's really busy,
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.800]   it can be hard to get a reservation at a restaurant.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.280]   So going for dinner at a food hall
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.920]   is a totally worthy option
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.160]   'cause you don't have to plan.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.600]   And then if you're with a bunch of friends
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.640]   or if you're just with one person,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.800]   you're in the mood for different things,
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.760]   you can each get what you want.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.200]   I really like the one at Klemmer, that particular food hall.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.440]   And then there's a new one at the post office, Postus,
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.560]   that is pretty cool as well.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.800]   By now, you've probably already filed your taxes.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.400]   And if you had to spend any time searching your email
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.480]   for donation receipts or even worse,
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.040]   you spent no time on it at all
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.920]   because you didn't get to take advantage
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.680]   of the incredible charitable giving tax deduction,
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.280]   then you need to check this out.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.720]   This year, thanks to Daffy,
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.160]   I didn't have to search for any donation receipts,
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.400]   but I absolutely got my tax deductions.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.640]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them again
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.040]   for this episode.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.360]   Daffy is a modern platform and app for charitable giving,
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.340]   allowing you to give to any charity across the US
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.000]   with just a few taps.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.680]   But it's so much more than that
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.600]   because they do it all
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.760]   by helping you set up a donor advised fund or DAF,
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   which is a tax advantaged account
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.400]   that lets you contribute cash, stock, or crypto
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.920]   on a one-time or recurring basis,
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.160]   take that tax deduction at the time of the contribution,
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.400]   and then distribute that money
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.680]   to over one and a half million charities, schools,
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.080]   and faith-based organizations
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.000]   whenever you want to down the road.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Amy and I are such huge fans of Daffy.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.560]   We've been giving to our DAF for the past few years,
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.040]   and Daffy has really helped us
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.480]   be so much more intentional with our giving,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.840]   which is something we're proud of
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.880]   and excited to start sharing with our kids
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.440]   as they get a little older.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.400]   So if you want to optimize your giving,

[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.560]   If you've been meaning to get life insurance,
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.960]   but have been putting it off, now is the time.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.680]   With Fabric by Gerber Life,

[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.480]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.680]   I actually went online to compare prices,
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.000]   and I found Fabric to be highly competitive
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.120]   with great policies, like a million dollars in coverage

[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.720]   to make sure you get to drink in Iceland,
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.320]   just if you wanna have that kind of local culinary experience?
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.120]   - There's a lot of novelty food in Iceland,
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.760]   like rotten fermented shark and all this kind of stuff,
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.960]   and it's pretty gimmicky, and it doesn't make a meal.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.000]   So, the two things that I always recommend
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.320]   is fish and lamb.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.240]   And the lamb roam free in the Icelandic countryside,
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.780]   and they eat angelica.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.680]   So, they have a very distinct taste
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.520]   because they sort of absorb that herbaceousness
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.360]   when you eat them.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.160]   It's really incredible.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.200]   And they serve the lamb towards the rarer side.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.800]   It's a really different lamb experience
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   than what you're gonna have in an American restaurant.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.200]   And the fish is just totally incredible.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.840]   Everything is freshly caught,
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.920]   and you're gonna find it in a lot of different forms.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.880]   At the more down-to-earth restaurants,
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.740]   and a lot of restaurants in the countryside,
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.640]   you're gonna get lamb soup, or lamb stew,
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.820]   or a fish soup, or a fish stew,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.720]   and that's the perfect way to fill up
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.920]   for significantly less money while you're on the road.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.720]   And it's in a vat, so it comes quick,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.000]   and they serve it to you.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.260]   By far, my favorite thing is to eat
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:52.060]   all like grandma's recipe, even at the nicest restaurants.
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.700]   - I'm thinking about all these places you mentioned.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.300]   Is Reykjavik small enough that it's like,
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.500]   it's pretty easy to get around?
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.860]   If you're there for two or three days,
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.140]   do you need the rental car there
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.540]   to go check these places out,
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.300]   or how do you think about that?
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.140]   - Absolutely not.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.020]   If you're planning to only go to Reykjavik
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.000]   on your trip for a few days, do not get a rental car,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.100]   because parking is a total nightmare in the city center.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.300]   All the locals have vehicles
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.900]   because they wanna go out to their summer houses
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:18.020]   on the weekends, they wanna get out of the city and explore.
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.540]   And a lot of their needs,
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.260]   like a lot of the big grocery stores and malls,
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.980]   the big box shopping that they need to do
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.660]   is a little bit outside the city center,
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.100]   so they need a car for that.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.780]   I would absolutely advise against
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.920]   getting a vehicle in the city.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.180]   Beyond restaurants, the big social pastime
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.540]   is the hot pot culture, the hot springs culture.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.260]   There's water everywhere,
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.740]   and Blue Lagoon has been famous for a very long time.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.160]   It's right near the airport, so a lot of people go.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:50.180]   But I would highly recommend going to a municipal pool
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.400]   while you're in Reykjavik.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.080]   There's a lot of them.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.720]   My favorite one is Vesterberg on the west side,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.100]   walkable from the city center.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.940]   I've been there 300 times, maybe,
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.960]   and it's totally walkable from the apartment
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.160]   that I used to have, which was right in the city center.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.440]   There's just a social element to bathing in the water.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.240]   It's like the perfect hangover cure.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.840]   I like going in the evenings.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.260]   At the end of the day, it's like you've been walking around,
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.580]   your legs are tired, maybe you were on a hike,
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:22.060]   and I would absolutely do it in central Reykjavik,
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.980]   in addition to doing it all over the country.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.260]   But this is a really important part
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.860]   of the Icelandic experience.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.380]   And a lot of fancy hot spring destinations have opened.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.740]   There's Sky Lagoon.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.220]   There's actually one called Krøyma,
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.340]   Simmering, like we were talking about before.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:38.980]   There's Secret Lagoon.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.700]   There's a new one that opened called Kvamsvik.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.940]   That's just outside the city.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.700]   You'll need cars to get to these.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.940]   They're significantly more expensive,
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.040]   but if you think of it as entertainment
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.340]   instead of a swimming pool,
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.940]   it becomes worth the money, in my opinion.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.980]   And you can get a beer at a lot of them.
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.660]   - The advice someone gave me was that
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.780]   most towns have these community hot springs.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.100]   They're free and open to the public
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.580]   and a great way to meet people.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.060]   So it sounds like you could balance both of those
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.140]   and do this as you're traveling around the country.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.680]   - Yeah, there's a whole mixed bag of municipal pools
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.520]   all over the country.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.220]   So a little municipality will have a pool
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.140]   where you could do laps and then a hot tub next to it
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.340]   where you can soak.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.580]   And you have to pay a fee to use those.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:22.700]   And then there's just ones in the wild
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.780]   where people have cemented a little thing
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.420]   or there's a barrel
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.300]   and you kind of get pointed in their direction.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.020]   You can actually look on Google,
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.100]   if you Google hot springs,
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.660]   there's so many websites that are trying
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.500]   to commoditize this, make money off of you for clicking it.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.140]   You could just get it on Google Maps.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.920]   There's lists everywhere of where these are.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.420]   My favorite are up in the West fjords
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.660]   along the Strandir coast.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.500]   One is called Traunsnes and the other Krusneslaug.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:54.180]   They're like my two favorite kind of in the wild hot pots.
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:55.820]   They're not quite free anymore.
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.220]   A lot of the ones that are out in nature,
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.240]   there'll be like a little donation box,
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.100]   which is tricky 'cause you don't need to take out cash.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.300]   In Iceland at all, everything you can do on a credit card,
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.780]   but there is an expectation now if you're a tourist
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.980]   that you do leave something when you go
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.840]   to the more wild ones out of courtesy,
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.040]   because they have to be cleaned
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.440]   and they have to be maintained.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.040]   And with more tourists comes more usage.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.100]   You need to keep the water clean.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.960]   You have to bathe in a shower completely naked
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.200]   before you put your bathing suit on to go in.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.840]   That is a social requirement.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.080]   It is a must.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.280]   A lot of the fancier facilities have private showers.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.180]   All the municipal pools just have nozzles.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.560]   You must get naked.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.320]   A lot of the facilities used to have professional watchers
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.520]   that would watch you bathe to make sure
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.000]   that you were using soap to clean under your arms
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.560]   and your bathing suit area.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.640]   - Wow, that just reminds me, like there's a cultural norm,
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.880]   like make sure you know that so you don't get in trouble.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.800]   Any other random things like that to keep in mind?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.760]   - I mean, my ultimate favorite municipal pool
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.600]   is the one in Hufsos in the Northwest.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.760]   That one's super cool.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.360]   It's like built like almost like an infinity pool.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.560]   It's pretty incredible.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.600]   Like the ones you have to pay $50 to go to
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.120]   are kind of similar.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.100]   So if you're in the region, detour to Hufsos
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.680]   and definitely go to that one.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.480]   - Any other things in Reykjavik to not miss,
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.680]   whether it's museum, art, nightlife, other things?
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.640]   - I would definitely refer back to Grapevine
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.880]   for the latest on cool shops to check out.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.760]   There's just a roaring design culture
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.800]   and a lot of shops will have small boutiques
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.400]   of things that people are making locally or doing
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.200]   and all over the city shopping is super fun.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.160]   I like cafe culture.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.200]   I like holing up and having an incredible cup of coffee,
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.920]   people watching, seeing who else is there,
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.360]   going to like cool shops,
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.760]   dialoguing with the people who own those shops
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.080]   about the traditional loopy sweaters
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.120]   that they're making out of wool,
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:01.120]   from that to like really cool bathing gear,
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   interior design stuff, that vibe.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.240]   - And we hit a lot of things.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.320]   We talked about hot springs,
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.760]   we talked about hiking, Northern Lights, eating.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.600]   What about the language?
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.720]   You said it'd be good to learn a few words.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.000]   Any tips for which ones and where and how?
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.240]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a few pronunciation conventions
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.680]   that can be really confusing.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   The rite of passage in Iceland is trying to name
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.400]   that volcano that erupted about 12 years ago
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.640]   that had the really long name
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.560]   and there's like a hundred YouTubes of news anchors
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.720]   flubbing the pronunciation.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.080]   It's Eyjafjallajökull.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:39.760]   And if you can nail that, people will be really impressed.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.000]   So I would work on that before you arrive.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.800]   A few things like on signs that you want to check out
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:49.080]   to kind of understand that there's a few extra letters
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.360]   in the Icelandic alphabet.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:54.800]   So there's the Eð, which is like a D with a slash in it.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.880]   And that is pronounced like a th.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.320]   And then there's Þórn, which is like a P,
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:04.000]   but the cup of the P is like a little bit lower.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.960]   It's sort of in the middle of the stem
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.800]   and that's a Þ, like thing.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.880]   And then there's a O with an umlaut that's like Ø.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   And then a double L is actually like the TL in kettle.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:24.160]   So Fjall is like F-J-A-L-L,
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.400]   or like there's a place called Hætlisandur.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.720]   So it's not Hælisandur, it's Hætlisandur.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.360]   And it's little things like that,
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.920]   that if you can get them right,
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.400]   like a H and a V has like a k sound.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.160]   So there's a town outside of Reykjavik called Hveragerði,
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.800]   but it starts with an H.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.240]   You'll kind of lose people if you're like,
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.640]   where's Hvaragerði?
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.160]   It's Hveragerði.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.520]   It's tricky, but you need to get these things
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.680]   in order for people to properly understand you.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.560]   The J is like a Y.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.560]   So again, the word for mountain, Fjall is F-J-F-J-L-L-T-L.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.840]   Those are just a few examples.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.120]   - So unlike some places where it's like,
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.640]   oh, maybe I should learn where's the bathroom,
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.480]   where's this?
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.320]   It sounds like maybe the better thing to focus on
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.960]   is just try to nail some pronunciation.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.640]   So when you're talking about places to go and landmarks
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.680]   and stuff like that, you could just say them.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.920]   - Yeah, the ones that I just mentioned,
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.800]   I would go back and re-listen if you are going
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.400]   and try to get those.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.640]   That's like a good five or six to nail.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.800]   There's a few more,
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.720]   but I feel like that might be too deep of a dive.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.680]   That's a really good start.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.560]   If there are three words that you're gonna remember,
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.760]   gratitude I think is always the most important
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.840]   to express gratitude.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.200]   So thank you, takk fyrd.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:46.040]   And then people say bless, like bless you,
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.760]   bless when they say goodbye.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.080]   So it's not religiously charged.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.960]   It's just when you leave a store or say goodbye to someone,
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.120]   they will say bless to you,
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.480]   which can be a little confusing
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.480]   if you don't know what it's for.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.400]   And then good day, good day.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.320]   - All right.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:09.600]   Any other kind of secret places, that great Iceland vibe,
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.080]   maybe not as crowded that you wanna tap on?
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.640]   - I think really can't overexpress how much in the way
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.160]   that so many Icelanders live in the Reykjavik region.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.920]   So many tourists congregate in the Reykjavik region.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   If you have the energy to get far away out of the region,
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.680]   the East fjords or the West fjords,
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:35.520]   you will have an experience that you covet
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.960]   with significantly less people.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.320]   So if that is something that's really important to you,
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.520]   put in that energy, take that domestic flight
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.360]   or put in the drive and you'll get that return.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.440]   - And I know you don't have kids,
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.080]   but you've met plenty of people
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.520]   that have traveled around Iceland.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:54.640]   Kid-friendly place culturally
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.160]   and kind of some of the activities?
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.440]   - Yeah, a wonderfully family-friendly destination
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.680]   to the point where in the news,
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.080]   you'll hear like the biggest scandal that happens
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.040]   is a teenager stole a car and drove it a block
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.280]   and then got out and returned the keys to the owner.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.160]   It's that kind of destination where it's super safe.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.000]   And there's a culture of leaving your children
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.520]   in their prams outside of a restaurant
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.840]   'cause it's supposed to be good for them
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.880]   to be kind of bundled up in the cold.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.520]   You'll find that all throughout Scandinavia,
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:26.440]   but it's not weird to go to brunch,
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.440]   but leave your baby outside.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.000]   - This is something my wife and I were talking about
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.120]   'cause it's also true in other countries, like you said.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.720]   And so don't be alarmed if you see that here,
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.280]   because I think in the States,
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.480]   people would definitely freak out.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.320]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.400]   And I mean, kids are gonna love this.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.600]   It's such a candy-friendly destination.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.360]   And there's skir, also this very proteinous kind of yogurt
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.920]   that's absolutely delicious.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.840]   But there's a lot of things that kids are gonna love,
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.560]   like the amount of licorice.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.440]   There's like a bizarre licorice obsession.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.840]   And they have all these really cool candies,
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.040]   like rein is my favorite.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.800]   And it's basically like a KitKat
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   in a Rice Krispie treat dipped in chocolate.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.760]   And every time I go, I bring back like 20 boxes of rein.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.160]   And they love their licorice dipped in chocolate as well,
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.640]   which I'm not like a salty, sweet person,
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.640]   but rein is like my absolute guilty pleasure.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.600]   - Wow.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.160]   All right, I feel like we hit so much.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.920]   Anything we missed that you wanna make sure we cover,
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.240]   because I'm ready to go and I wanna make sure I have it all.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.080]   - I would definitely do some research on the hot springs.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.040]   There's like Vøk in the east,
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.920]   Forest Bath in the north, Geo Sea and Husavik.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.720]   These are all like really cool hot springs to check out.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.440]   I would also challenge you to eat sort of unconventionally
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.800]   when you're outside of Reykjavik.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.720]   One of the best meals I've had in Iceland
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.760]   was at the museum in Borgnes, which is in the west.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.000]   It's the settlement museum,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   which tells the story of the sagas and Iceland settlement,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.080]   but they have really good food at their buffet there.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.400]   So a lot of the conventions
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.080]   and the way we think about where to eat and what's cool,
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.200]   throw that all out.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.000]   You can go to a gas station in Iceland
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.480]   and have a really good hot dog.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.320]   So put all that prejudice aside.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.240]   - Amazing.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.160]   So I've talked to a few people
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.680]   that are planning trips this summer,
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.880]   and they're saying Iceland is a little packed.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.600]   I know you have a few places that you wanted to recommend
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.480]   that if someone wants that experience,
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.920]   but maybe doesn't, for whatever reason,
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.960]   wanna make it to Iceland or Iceland's too full,
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.600]   how do you get that same similar vibe somewhere else?
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.160]   - There's a lot of places in the greater region
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.480]   that are gonna give you a lot of the things
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.400]   that Iceland gives you, but without that tourist traffic.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.960]   And one of my favorite places in the entire world
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.080]   is Newfoundland, the easternmost province in Canada.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.520]   Canada has a problem with perception.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.720]   People don't find Canada sexy, but Newfoundland is an island.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.760]   It looks like it broke off Iceland at some point
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.200]   millions and millions of years ago.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.080]   It has all the fjords.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.400]   It has this really distinct culture.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.980]   Local Canadians actually still have a brogue,
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.440]   like a Scottish brogue in some of the smaller towns.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.200]   And you could do a really cool trip from the States
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.080]   where you fly in to the capital,
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.960]   you rent a car for like four or five days,
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.240]   drive up to the Bonavista Peninsula,
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.520]   stay at really cool inns and B&Bs or even rent a cottage,
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.720]   and you're gonna get like icebergs, whale watching,
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.520]   amazing hiking, one of the best hikes in Canada,
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.920]   the Skirwink Trail is up there.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.640]   It's just one of the most stunning places on earth,
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.340]   and it's so cheap because it's the Canadian dollar
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.340]   and not the kroner or even a euro, right, in Europe,
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.220]   that it just represents amazing value.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.380]   I love northern Norway as well.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.220]   There are tourists up there,
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:50.220]   but Lofoten is sort of a peninsula of islands
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.740]   that have all been strung together by bridges.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.700]   I am obsessed with that area,
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.820]   and it's the most dramatic mountains and water,
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.260]   and you can rent these old fishermen huts,
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:05.020]   these bright red cabins right out on the fjord.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.060]   That area is really special to me.
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.780]   I've been there five or six times,
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.900]   and I'm always desperate to go back.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.420]   That will give you a lot of the same energy,
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.220]   and you can really visit that any time of the year as well,
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.860]   and Greenland is ascending right now.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.060]   They're actually building a new international airport
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.460]   that are gonna have direct flights from the US,
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:30.620]   and that's gonna start in late 2024, early 2025,
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:34.220]   and it's just gonna completely change the island.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.540]   You're getting everything,
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:40.100]   this incredible, curious Greenlandic culture,
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.660]   flashes of Scandinavia and that Danish vibe,
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:48.420]   and extreme desolation and nature.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   I'm really excited for Greenland to evolve,
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.940]   'cause right now you have to fly actually through Iceland
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.480]   or through Copenhagen,
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.220]   so it's a really big trek for an American,
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.560]   but when those airports open,
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.780]   everything is about to change.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:02.620]   - Wow.
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.060]   You might be the first person I've ever talked to
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.540]   that's even been to Greenland, so.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.580]   - Yeah, I've been twice.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.540]   (laughing)
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.340]   - But I think I remember when I introduced you
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.340]   in a previous episode,
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.340]   it was like you've probably been to 130 plus,
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.740]   so you've probably been almost everywhere,
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.860]   places that most of us have never been.
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:18.100]   Any other places this year you've got on the docket
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.980]   that you're excited to check out?
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.380]   - I'm definitely going back to Iceland
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.580]   and spending some time there.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.140]   I'm really excited to get back
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.980]   because it's been about 18 months.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.380]   I'm pretty open.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.260]   The summer's looking really busy as far as movement.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.660]   There's still a lot of pent up kind of anger
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.540]   that the pandemic had us all shut in.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.100]   Prices are really, really high.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.100]   I'm really interested in kind of dipping
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.700]   into more emerging destinations.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.820]   Like I'd really like to visit the Caucasus
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.900]   and Georgia in particular.
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.740]   That's high on my to-do list.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.900]   I'm gonna go back to Japan at the end of the year again,
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.740]   'cause I always spend November and December in Japan.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.180]   I'm excited about some islands in the South Pacific
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.740]   that are ascending and some West Africa.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.580]   - Wow.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.620]   This has been incredible.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.940]   I keep saying it, but we've been talking
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.340]   about taking this trip to Iceland for almost a decade.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:08.420]   And now I feel like as soon as Amy hears this episode,
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.060]   she's like, "All right, let's get it booked."
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.900]   - One more thing that I wanted to mention,
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.780]   the Icelanders believe in a hidden world and hidden people,
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.680]   which means that there are elves that we can't see
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.060]   that are lurking in stone formations.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.140]   And you'll find a lot of the names of things like farms
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:30.060]   or elf church or elf lake, like Elftvat, elf lake.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.660]   And the government actually has someone
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.220]   who can communicate with a hidden world on retainer.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.420]   And so when they wanna build a new road
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.700]   in the middle of a lava field,
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.740]   they actually have to consult her to check
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:45.900]   if the elves are okay with their land being touched.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.580]   And I just love that there is this very quirky facet
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.900]   that sort of underlies your experience.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.780]   - Is there any way that someone traveling
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.100]   could like soak that in?
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.820]   Is there some like elf tour or can you meet
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.740]   with this government representative of the elves?
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.980]   - There is, there's actually a place
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.860]   called the elf garden in Hapnafjörður,
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:11.860]   which is the town just outside of Reykjavik.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.860]   A really easy drive if you have a car,
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.340]   it's in the greater Reykjavik area.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.140]   And it's the woman who used to work
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.420]   for the government doing this.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.540]   And she has an elf center and you can learn
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.780]   where the elves are hiding and she's around,
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.060]   you can talk to her.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:25.900]   - Wow.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.180]   Okay, Brandon, I have one more thing.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.820]   It's a little bit of a long shot.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.540]   And so feel free to say no.
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.900]   But on the wild chance that we could get
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.580]   a handful of people in the All The Hacks community
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.380]   interested to plan a trip to Iceland,
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.420]   would you be up for being a part of that
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.620]   and organizing some kind of like
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.980]   All The Hacks Iceland experience
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.540]   that meets the needs of these people?
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.220]   So if we're coming with kids, like we'll find someone,
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.540]   maybe a local teacher who can watch kids during the day
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.780]   so we can go on some of these adventures
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.020]   if kids are young, that kind of stuff?
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.340]   - Oh, definitely.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.300]   I mean, three phone calls and we'll have
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.180]   one of the best guides all to ourself
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.140]   to take us on the hidden hikes,
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.180]   check out some of those hidden hot springs
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.220]   that no one else knows about,
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.100]   meet some locals, spend time with them.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.020]   Oh yeah, let's do this.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.900]   - Okay, so I'm gonna go allthehacks.com/iceland.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.500]   I'm gonna put a small survey.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.580]   This is not something that I'm saying is happening, right?
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.300]   This came up on the fly,
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.300]   but if you go to allthehacks.com/iceland,
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.380]   answer a couple questions that I'll write up
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.780]   and maybe we'll see if this can happen.
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.900]   Where can people stay on top of all the travels
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.860]   you're doing, everything you're writing,
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.260]   because you just have such a great wealth of knowledge
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.860]   when it comes to all this stuff?
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:38.460]   - I try to post organically on Instagram,
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.180]   you know, when I'm on a trip researching.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.860]   I write mostly for magazines now.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.620]   I write a lot for Bloomberg and Vogue
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.300]   and Cunninghast Traveler and Traveler and Leisure.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.500]   So, you know, on my Instagram,
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.420]   I'm just kind of posting different stories
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.820]   that I'm writing, different places that I'm researching.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.820]   I really love connecting with all the listeners there.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.060]   It's been super fun when we did the Japan episode.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.140]   I get a message a day from people
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.940]   that are currently in Japan,
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.780]   like with a photo of one of the restaurants I recommended,
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.100]   being like, "Oh my God, I just ate here
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.860]   and it was so good, thank you."
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.740]   I just want people to enjoy travel.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.940]   It's become so expensive that I want people
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.540]   to get the most out of their experiences.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.140]   So feel free to reach out to me there.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.420]   I have a personal website, brandimpressor.com.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:20.420]   It's not a blog, it's just where I aggregate
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.340]   a lot of my information in books and articles.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.940]   - You didn't say it, but it's Brand Press.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.900]   - Yeah, Brand Press.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.460]   The first five letters of my first name and last name.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.300]   - Awesome.
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:31.860]   All right, thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.980]   I will send you some notes when we're there,
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.980]   which hopefully isn't too far from now.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:37.420]   - Awesome, thank you so much.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.860]   - Wow, that was so awesome.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.300]   The entire time I was thinking,
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.740]   how am I gonna plan this trip to Iceland this year?
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.940]   But now I'm thinking, how do we actually make this
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.860]   All The Hacks Iceland trip work?
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.220]   Yes, it's a crazy idea.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.620]   We'll see if any of you are interested.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:54.340]   Go to allthehacks.com/iceland and let me know.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.380]   I'll also include something in there for other countries.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:57.860]   So if you're not interested in Iceland,
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.820]   but you're generally interested in the idea,
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.540]   still go and fill that survey out
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.500]   and we'll see what happens.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.660]   So Iceland is interesting because it feels so far away,
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.140]   yet from the East Coast, it's only six hours.
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:09.140]   And from the West Coast,
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.180]   it's actually only about seven and a half hours,
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.340]   at least from Seattle.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.180]   So I had to actually go to this website, gcmap.com,
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.820]   which is the great circle mapping tool,
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.220]   which is interesting for flight distances.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.660]   And I realized, oh wow, Iceland is so far North
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:24.020]   that actually getting there from the West Coast
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.700]   isn't that much further.
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.860]   And so comes to question,
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:29.540]   if you're saving up all these points and miles
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.220]   and you're really always trying to do these great
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.100]   international business class trips,
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.660]   is Iceland really the trip to do it?
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.140]   And for a lot of reasons, I would say maybe not,
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.500]   but let me run through all the different ways
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.780]   to get to Iceland from the States and Canada.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.060]   First off, there are five airlines that you can fly.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.820]   I'll start with the US carriers, United and Delta.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.780]   Most of these flights are seasonal
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   and seasonal means about May to September.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.980]   So United flies from Chicago
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.100]   and Delta flies from Detroit, Minneapolis, and JFK.
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.660]   When it comes to miles,
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.340]   United actually might be a good option.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.860]   I looked at economy and there is availability this year
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.740]   in May, June, and September.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.980]   I think the overall theme here is that July and August
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:07.860]   are pretty difficult,
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.660]   but anything around that works pretty well.
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.620]   If you're trying to book those flights on United,
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.940]   it really depends what carrier you book from.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.540]   So you could book from United on those economy seats
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.940]   and do it for 84,000 points around trip.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.620]   But if you transfer points to Air Canada,
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.140]   you could do it for 70,000.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.780]   And if you transfer points to ANA,
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:26.980]   you could do it for 56,000.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.340]   I saw a lot of reports online
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.460]   that Avianca was also a great transfer partner,
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.380]   but for whatever reason,
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.540]   when I searched for these flights on the Avianca site,
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.380]   it didn't see the availability.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.780]   You might be able to call them and get it
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.180]   because it's definitely there
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.260]   and it definitely shows up on other partners,
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.500]   but I wasn't able to see it online.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.340]   In business class,
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:47.060]   I did actually see some flights in May, but very limited.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.060]   But again, really important where you book from
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.580]   because if it's United or Air Canada,
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.380]   it was 120,000 round trip.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.460]   But if you booked through ANA, it was 88,000 round trip.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.860]   So obviously ANA is a great option,
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:58.820]   but I will just flag two important things.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.140]   One, you can only transfer to ANA from Amex
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.660]   and ANA transfers take a few days.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.660]   So it's one of those things
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.140]   where if you don't have flexibility,
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:08.740]   it might not be worth the risk.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:11.100]   You don't wanna find one flight with just two seats
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.620]   and that's the only thing out there.
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.380]   Transfer to ANA and three days later,
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.540]   that inventory is gone.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.220]   And now you just have a bunch of ANA miles
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.700]   that you don't have a plan to use.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.380]   So I'd say when you're looking,
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.820]   ANA is a great option
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.580]   if you know you wanna take a trip to somewhere
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.460]   and you know you're gonna use ANA points
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.220]   and there's a lot of availability,
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.460]   but it might not be the best if it's really limited.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.220]   On Delta, I'd say,
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.580]   unless you just really wanna burn your Delta points,
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:35.980]   there's not a great option.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.260]   I looked from JFK in New York and in economy,
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:42.780]   the best possible deal I could find for all the dates
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.020]   was 160,000 points round trip.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.140]   And in business,
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.380]   the cheapest absolute thing I could find was in September,
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.940]   there were some flights for 450,000 round trip,
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.420]   which is absolutely crazy.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.460]   Using Delta miles for good value is so, so, so hard,
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.860]   which is why I generally try
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:02.100]   to not accrue any Delta miles if possible,
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.780]   because it's just so challenging.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.860]   In fact, most of the time I've been using my Delta miles
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.260]   has been for domestic trips,
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.820]   little short trips where the flight might be
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.460]   $300 or $400, but it's only 10,000 miles.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.060]   Otherwise, I've found it very hard
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.900]   to find availability for anything.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.740]   And if so, you really wanna plan far, far in advance.
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:20.180]   Other North American carriers, Air Canada,
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.940]   which flies from Montreal and Toronto.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.340]   I did find some availability.
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.340]   It's pretty decent.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.220]   In economy, it was 70,000 miles.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.900]   In business, it was 120,000.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.180]   That's what it takes to use Air Canada miles.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.580]   Again, similar to United,
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.120]   you might wanna see if there's another carrier like ANA
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.740]   that makes it cheaper to buy.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.560]   Then for the Icelandic carriers,
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.540]   there are two.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.600]   There's Icelandair and Play.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.340]   Play is a new airline that was started
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:47.420]   by some of the people who previously ran Wow,
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.140]   which was a really low discount carrier
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.420]   that went out of business.
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.740]   If I remember correctly and do your homework,
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.740]   when they went out of business,
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:57.340]   it was a real big mess for anyone who had flights booked.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.300]   So I would say, keep that in mind
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:01.540]   if you're planning something really far in advance.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.220]   Icelandair flies from so many destinations in the US.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:05.460]   I think it's about 14,
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.860]   all the way from Vancouver, Seattle on the West Coast
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.720]   to basically the entire East Coast
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.000]   and a few places in between
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.120]   like Denver and Minneapolis and Chicago.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.800]   Definitely an option, but very hard to use points.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.640]   Technically, they are an Alaska Air partner,
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.040]   but everything I read online
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.480]   is that it's almost impossible to use Alaska miles
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.920]   to book on Icelandair.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.280]   If you're able to make it work, definitely let me know,
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.000]   but it looks very difficult
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.800]   and I wouldn't waste your time on business,
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.920]   paid or with points
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.040]   because their business class looks about the same
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.940]   as like domestic short haul coach,
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.300]   just a bigger seat, roomier, but definitely not a lie flat
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:42.740]   and definitely doesn't look like anything
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.820]   that I like to splurge my miles on for with business class.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.460]   So for that, you're just gonna have to pay.
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:50.780]   But like Brandon mentioned, they do have a program
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.200]   where if you want to fly Icelandair to Europe,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.100]   because they have a ton of destinations in Europe,
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.980]   you can do a free stopover in Iceland.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:59.460]   So that's another great option if you're paying.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:04.460]   And on play, they only fly from Baltimore, Boston, DC.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.740]   Technically, they say they fly from New York,
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.880]   but it's from Stewart Airport,
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.420]   which is about an hour and a half bus ride from Manhattan.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.660]   And then also from Toronto, but from Hamilton Airport,
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.360]   not the main airport.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.480]   So what's interesting about play actually
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.900]   is that one, very, very, very, very affordable.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.360]   I was looking at flights and you can get there
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.140]   from as little as $200 each way, which was awesome.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.020]   And their entire economy cabin for these flights
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.820]   has 34 inches of leg room,
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.960]   which is about the same as you get on Economy Plus,
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.360]   on United, Comfort Plus on Delta.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.060]   So I'd say if you're buying a coach ticket,
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.860]   sometimes I think the discount airlines,
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.460]   it's gonna have the worst experience.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.980]   In this case, you're actually getting the most leg room
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.700]   of any other basic coach ticket
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.300]   where you're not in the kind of premium economy cabin.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:52.340]   However, everything else is an add-on, bags, food, drink,
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.940]   and there is no power, no wifi, no entertainment.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:58.700]   So no frills, except the leg room, but super cheap.
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.340]   The short of that, unfortunately,
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.620]   is that there aren't a lot of great options
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.460]   for points and miles.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.060]   Yes, you could do it on United.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:07.260]   Yes, maybe you could do it through Air Canada.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.100]   Everything else is gonna be tough.
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.260]   But fortunately, there are a lot of options
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.420]   for not that expensive.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.660]   And because the flight's short,
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.500]   I think it's not one of those aspirational trips
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.400]   from the perspective of wanting to fly
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.940]   in these beautiful business class cabins
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.820]   and use your points there.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.460]   So for me, if we were looking to do this,
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.660]   I'd probably end up just buying the economy ticket
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.140]   and flying as close to direct as possible,
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.900]   which unfortunately, from the West Coast,
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.580]   means changing planes somewhere.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.820]   And I will say while we're here,
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.400]   despite that it's not relevant to Iceland,
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.980]   I just wanna flag that there are a handful
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:37.660]   of transfer bonuses happening right now for your points.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.860]   So if you are looking to book a flight in the near future,
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.420]   definitely consider this.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:45.460]   For going to Air France KLM Flying Blue,
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:49.660]   there's a 25% transfer bonus on Chase that ends on the 15th,
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:53.140]   and then a 25% transfer bonus on Amex that ends on the 22nd.
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.060]   So get some extra points there.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.900]   And then going to Avianca Life Miles from Amex,
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.680]   you get 15% more miles until the end of May.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.740]   And then from Chase to Virgin Atlantic,
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.140]   you get 30% bonus until June 15th.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.440]   There's also a 50% transfer bonus to Marriott on Chase
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.000]   until the 15th of May,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.140]   but I just don't love using Chase points for Marriott,
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.160]   even with this bonus,
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.640]   'cause I think the valuation's not there.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.480]   So not one I'm excited about.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.180]   However, let's move over to hotels.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.020]   This one is gonna be shorter than some countries.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.320]   I think when we talked about Japan,
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.200]   there were 30 plus hotels in every chain.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.100]   And when it comes to using your points in Iceland,
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.640]   I found eight hotels.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.160]   Now, finding award hotels has historically been a huge pain.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.280]   It literally was me going on the Hyatt site,
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.440]   the Marriott site,
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.400]   and just searching on individual websites.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.240]   The filtering, sorting, it's really just not that good.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.800]   And so I am so thankful.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.680]   So when I was doing this, I just went to Aways,
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.440]   which is a site I've talked about before,
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.960]   and I'm such a big fan of.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.500]   It's like all the great tools that there are for flights,
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.680]   there was never a great tool for hotels.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.640]   And then Aways came out recently.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.960]   I found it this year, and it's just been so helpful.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.080]   So I type in Iceland, I type in the dates.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.200]   You can say whether you have Hilton, Hyatt,
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.600]   IHG, or Marriott points,
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.680]   but you can also just say I have Amex, Chase,
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.640]   or Built Points,
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:12.280]   and they'll filter on only the points you have.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.000]   They also have, you can filter on free night certificates.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.360]   So if you've got a Hilton free night,
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.580]   or Marriott certificates,
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.200]   even how many Marriott certificate points you have,
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.120]   35,000, 50,000, whatever the category.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.480]   So they make it super easy.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.560]   And so I searched for Iceland,
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.080]   and it was very easy to see
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.700]   that there are eight hotels you can use your points on.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.480]   So whether you're planning a trip to Iceland
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.320]   or anywhere else, definitely check out Aways
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.160]   if you're looking to use points for hotels
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.360]   and wanna find live cash and award pricing,
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.740]   get award availability,
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.920]   see a calendar of the days those are available.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.880]   So if there's a hotel you have your heart set on,
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.600]   you can look at when that's available,
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.480]   which I actually used a lot in researching Iceland
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.320]   to try to get a sense of,
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.080]   okay, well, if you were flexible with when you could go,
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.960]   when can you get the best deal on hotels?
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.840]   So Aways has a free version.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.840]   You can go and search for availability.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.680]   But if you also wanna get a longer calendar view,
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:02.200]   do some individual searching, filter on a few more things.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.000]   They do have a premium plan,
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.720]   but you can try it out for a day to see if you like it.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.680]   If you go to allthehacks.com/aways,
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.400]   and you'll get a little bit of an extra discount
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.300]   for doing that.
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.080]   So definitely recommend it.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.240]   It's basically my go-to search for hotels
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.620]   when I'm trying to use points and see what's a good deal.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.860]   They even show the cash price
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.480]   so you can get a sense of whether or not
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.720]   it is a good time to use points or not.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.880]   Back to hotels, there are eight options in Iceland.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.680]   There's one Hyatt, the Hotel Ranga.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.880]   Forgive me for getting all the names mispronounced,
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:30.720]   I'm sure.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.580]   It's about 90 minutes from Reykjavik.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:35.140]   And it actually looked pretty easy to find availability
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:38.480]   except July for 30 to 35,000 Hyatt points,
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.000]   which by the way, you can get from Chase or Built.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.320]   Then Hilton had decent availability at all three hotels.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.720]   All three are in Reykjavik and between 60 and 80,000 points,
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.440]   but they all had decent availability.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.460]   So if prices are high, that could be an option
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.220]   if you have Hilton points.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.460]   And then five Marriott properties.
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.920]   One was the Reykjavik addition,
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.240]   which the addition line from Marriott
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.800]   has been something that kind of intrigued me.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.760]   It's super high-end.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.600]   It looks awesome.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.980]   I've never stayed at one.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.040]   So that's one that I was pretty interested in.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.680]   There were some really good values there
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.000]   where a stay was over $1,000 a night,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.120]   but you could get it for 70, 75,000 points.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.200]   In general, it's in the 75 to 80,000 point range.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.160]   So I'd say you get the most
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.800]   out of your Marriott points there.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.600]   There's one courtyard at the airport.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.080]   I'm gonna assume that you're not gonna be spending
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   a lot of time near the airport
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.600]   based on how our entire conversation went.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.060]   So I'd skip that.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.300]   Two others in Reykjavik,
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.140]   the 101 Hotel and the Ion City Hotel.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.220]   Those two and the one I'll get to after
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.460]   are all parts of the Design Hotels collection,
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.460]   and they are all really, really cool.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.100]   Like really great design.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.300]   Looks like a kind of place, at least,
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.980]   I would really love to stay.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.460]   They were all in the 60 to 80,000 points a night range.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.820]   Do keep in mind that with Marriott,
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.900]   if you book four nights, you get your fifth night free.
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.820]   So that drops a little bit.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:55.220]   Availability varied depending on each hotel.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.320]   I would say in general, it was easier in June and September
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.920]   and very hard in July and August.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.080]   The last one is the Ion Adventure Hotel,
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.160]   which looked amazing.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.920]   It's kind of right in the middle of that golden circle area
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.320]   that Brandon talked about.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.380]   Again, beautiful hotel.
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.640]   These Design Hotel collections that Marriott has,
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.880]   I really, really like.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.820]   I've stayed at a few around the world,
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.920]   especially that one I mentioned in the Japan episode,
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.400]   Satoyama Jujo, and it was awesome.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.220]   So not a lot of hotel options for Iceland,
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.560]   but there are eight, and the availability for all of them.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.160]   Yes, you could go to individual sites,
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.580]   but you can also go to Aways, and it's just super easy
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.400]   because you can see the whole calendar.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.420]   Again, allthehacks.com/aways to get a deal there.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.620]   And I think that's it.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:38.500]   Normally, there's a lot more because there are dozens
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.440]   and dozens of hotels and lots of flight options.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.000]   Iceland's a little trickier for all of this.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.900]   I didn't go into all the hotel options
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.320]   that you could stay at for dollars.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.040]   I'll let you do your own research there.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.640]   Or if we plan this trip, I'll let Brandon help us out.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:53.620]   That's all I've got.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.100]   I hope you're as excited to go to Iceland as I am,
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.580]   maybe even on a trip together.
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:58.420]   We'll see.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.620]   I know it's a crazy idea.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:00.740]   We still have two young kids,
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.620]   so maybe it won't happen this year,
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.220]   but it's at least something that I think
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.540]   would be really fun to start doing with this community.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.180]   So allthehacks.com/iceland for that.
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.300]   That's all for this week.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:11.140]   See you next week.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:21.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:34.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
