[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we do a Q&A show.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.560]   Joshua, how do I open a discussion on whole life insurance with people who have been taught
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.040]   to only buy term and invest the difference?
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.240]   How do we mentor young people toward financial independence, help them to see what their
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.320]   possibilities and their options are?
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.560]   Joshua, what's your process of note-taking for books?
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.640]   Joshua, what about Roth versus traditional and are you confusing the effective tax rate
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.920]   with the marginal tax rate?
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.880]   Then if we have time, hey, I'm in the military and I'm being called to do a bunch of expensive
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880]   stuff I don't want to do.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:57.440]   Do you have any useful tactics and strategies that might help me overcome?
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.360]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.080]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.360]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.920]   This is the show where we're dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.000]   insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.040]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:29.520]   Today we seek to fulfill that mission with Q&A.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040]   I've built up an extremely long queue of questions from the audience, many of which are just
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920]   great questions that I really want to answer.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.560]   So I'm going to do some Q&A shows starting it off with this one.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080]   I hope that you enjoy these.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.240]   Happy to receive questions from you.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.360]   A couple of ways to do that.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.280]   The best way to get access to the questions is to join one of our Friday Q&A calls.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.260]   Those calls are open to patrons of the show.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.560]   You can find all that information at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron if you would like to get on a Friday Q&A
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560]   call.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.760]   Also, you can email me, Joshua@RadicalPersonalFinance.com, although you might be better served to use
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.040]   the contact form on the website.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.840]   It's a little bit safer.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.560]   If you want to email in a question, I get tons of emailed questions.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.960]   So those are difficult to always get in the queue or you can leave them on the voicemail
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960]   line.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   Just look at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.160]   The best way to do it is just on your mobile phone.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.920]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.720]   Click the "Leave us a voicemail" button and leave me a voicemail message and I do voicemail
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.800]   messages shows from some time.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.440]   It's been a while since I've done one of those.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.880]   I have a queue of those built up and I do intend to do one of those shows.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.760]   Before we jump into these Q&As, quick sponsor of today's show is YNAB, the You Need a Budget
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.960]   budgeting software.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.280]   YNAB is awesome.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   It solves all of the major problems that have been associated with budgeting in the past.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.080]   The most important reason to do a budget is to curb and adjust your future behavior.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.740]   The challenge is that most budgeting systems don't do that.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.960]   Most budgeting systems that people call a budget are simply tracking systems where they
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   look back to the history and adjust and say, "Here's what we did and what we spent."
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.640]   Well, sometimes looking back, it's hard to make a good decision.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.940]   Better to make a good decision going forward and YNAB solves that problem by allowing you
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.760]   to budget the money that you have in your bank account toward the goals that you have
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   today.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   Check it out.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.840]   Download a free 30-day trial of the software at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.480]   We affectionately refer to that as YNAB, Y-N-A-B.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.040]   It's an acronym for You Need a Budget.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.120]   First question on today's show, Joshua, I've been working as a new financial representative
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.760]   with a large insurance company that has a lot of whole life insurance business.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.640]   I've redacted the name for a few months now and have a large market of Christians who
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.780]   have been exposed to Dave Ramsey's financial peace campaign.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.120]   The result is a lot of prospects who are skeptical of the merits of whole life insurance policies
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.280]   because Ramsey preaches in favor of term and investments and is very much against cash
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   value altogether.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   Of course, no general strategy can apply to everyone.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.840]   Each side of that argument has its advantages and it leads to some fascinating conversations.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.000]   I'm sure your listeners would be interested in hearing arguments on either side of the
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.600]   buy term and invest the rest debate and knowing your history in the business, I'd be interested
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.280]   in hearing your perspective on the topic, James.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.200]   James, this question I'm not going to dig into with all of the arguments.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.840]   What I am going to do is I'm going to try to answer this to you in the function of a
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.560]   sales capacity of how I would approach this if I were actually interested in selling insurance.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.600]   Here's what I have learned the hard one way.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.920]   If you get into a discussion with people on this topic in an early stage, you're done
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.920]   for.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.120]   You've lost already.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.560]   The reason is because you're committing the cardinal error of sales which is selling something
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.200]   that you want to sell instead of planning for a client's needs.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.760]   The major problem with life insurance and the debate the way it's done is that people
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.400]   are going out selling the product that they want.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.760]   This whole debate â€“ I shouldn't be too strong but it just angers me because once
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.680]   you understand what term life insurance is, how it works, its advantages, disadvantages
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.360]   and its major characteristics and once you understand what whole life insurance is, how
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.680]   it works, its advantages, disadvantages and its major characteristics, you won't make
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.400]   the mistake of trying to confuse the two.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   They do very different things.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.080]   What happens though is that the insurance industry makes the mistake of marching out
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.940]   there and saying, "Well, we do this.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.200]   We believe in this."
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   Guess what?
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.600]   I'm all for religious belief.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.440]   I think that's very important but don't ascribe religious belief to something that
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.140]   doesn't need it.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.840]   You don't need religious belief when it comes to what kind of insurance do you believe
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.200]   in.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.600]   If you get into a discussion with somebody in an early stage on this topic, you're
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   done.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   You've lost already.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.360]   This is a major challenge for those of us who go into financial planning, consultative
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.080]   selling type of situation and we usually want to dig into these topics.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.080]   Guess what?
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.800]   I did that for years and learned it didn't work.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.440]   I'm going to try to save you some time and save any of the rest of you who are financial
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.480]   advisors and financial planners a little bit of the hard one.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.200]   I'll save you some of the time with helping you avoid some of the mistakes that I have
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   made.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.800]   Do not get into discussions with people on product fit.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.480]   Are there exceptions?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   Of course, there are exceptions but think about it this way.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.280]   If you went to a doctor and the very first discussion with the doctor, they're telling
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.880]   you that, "Well, my philosophy with cancer is to do surgery," or, "My philosophy with
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:56.640]   cancer is to prescribe drugs," or, "My philosophy with cancer is to do a natural nutrition-based
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   approach."
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.600]   Wouldn't you be a little bit suspect that perhaps that doctor is trying to bring their
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.360]   philosophy and promote their agenda instead of actually trying to help you with your medical
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   condition?
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.920]   If it were me and my doctor without looking at my x-rays, without looking at the results
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.080]   of any scans or tests I'd had and they're telling me, "Hey, I believe in this," I'd
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.200]   get up and walk out.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.160]   Now, that doesn't mean they can't have a strong opinion.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.720]   If you go to a surgeon, they're obviously going to be skilled with surgery.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.400]   It doesn't mean that if you go and consult a holistic, natural-focused person that they're
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.680]   not going to prescribe nutrition treatments.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.280]   You're expecting that and you're probably seeking that out.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.920]   But even if you were sympathetic to their approach, you'd still want them to talk about
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.840]   the situation.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.920]   You are the one who is creating these conversations for people.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.160]   You're creating this discussion about term life insurance versus whole life insurance
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:10.520]   and you're doing it because you think it's an interesting topic.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.720]   The reason I know this is simply because I know that the vast majority of consumers do
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.040]   not have a clue when it comes to insurance.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:27.120]   If you will stop bringing this topic up, your customers and prospective clients will also
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.680]   stop bringing it up.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.880]   You're the one who's creating those conversations and you're creating them because you like
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   the debate or at least because you think that it's important to talk about.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.720]   So I recommend you stop arguing with people.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:49.440]   In the role of a financial advisor, you need to become an expert on finding out what people
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.960]   want first.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.520]   Ignore the product questions that people ask you and figure out what they want.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.600]   Now, I'm using strong statements.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.960]   We have to do that when making a point.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.960]   Obviously there are exceptions.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.440]   If someone asks you specifically and says, "Hey, what do you think it is on this subject?"
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.920]   Well, you need to answer the question.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   Don't be evasive.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   You're not a politician.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.720]   Answer the question but quickly turn it back on trying to find out what is their goal,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.680]   what is their situation, what's their solution.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.280]   And if you'll spend more time asking questions of people and less time talking about what
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.100]   you believe about this debate that goes on in the financial business, you'll have much
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.400]   more success.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.800]   You're simply not going to convince somebody who has a strong opinion on what's right
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.360]   that they're wrong.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   So quit trying.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.100]   Instead, just listen to them and then find out how you can actually help and serve them.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.800]   If you will do that, if you'll ask questions, if you'll find out what their goals are and
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.200]   then you'll do the process and the hard work of building financial plans, what will happen
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.440]   is â€“ and then you make professional recommendations to go back to the CFP, financial planning
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440]   process.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.800]   If you're not a CFP yet, so go and just study what does the process look like.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.520]   Listen to people, ask questions, gather facts, gather data, make professional recommendations.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.220]   If you do that, what you'll find is that in the majority of cases that you're referring
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.520]   to, you're a young financial representative, you're working with young families, you're
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.680]   not a skilled subject matter expert.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.680]   In the majority of those cases, you never need to bother with talking about whether
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   somebody should have term life insurance or whole life insurance because the majority
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.920]   of your people that you're working with will need a majority of their insurance needs
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.160]   a return life insurance first.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.360]   If you do good planning for people and you help them save for emergency funds and you
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.360]   help them set up disability insurance policies and you help them set up term life insurance
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.280]   policies, the majority of those cases, you're going to use up all of the available budget
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.040]   before you ever get to a whole life insurance policy.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.620]   That's the appropriate way to do planning.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.640]   Now if you do that, you'll also open up the conversations with those people for whom
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.720]   whole life insurance might be a good and useful fit for them.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.600]   And then having listened to them, made a professional recommendation, because you've listened to
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.400]   them first and you've understood it and you've spent your time thinking, "If I were in this
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.520]   person's shoes, what would I buy and why would I buy it?"
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.160]   Dave Ramsey will never come into the picture.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.900]   I promise.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:30.720]   Because that person is not going, the person for whom whole life insurance is an important
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.660]   component of their financial plan or a viable component of their financial plan, they're
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.980]   usually not listening to Dave Ramsey.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:45.500]   So I know I'm stepping around the question, but it's a really frustrating question because
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:53.180]   once you understand the products, they're as different as a Toyota Camry is from a Ford
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.180]   F350.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.980]   They're very different vehicles.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.420]   And you don't accidentally wind up in one when you were looking for the other.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.220]   They do different things.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.100]   Doesn't mean they can't go and complement one another together.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.540]   Doesn't mean they can't fit together, but they do different things.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.640]   And so you've got to assess them at different points in the fact pattern.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   Hope that helps to you.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.720]   That's just a discussion.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:25.360]   If insurance agents would stop selling their pet product and start doing good planning
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:35.560]   for people, this whole debate would be severely diminished and that would be a very good thing.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   Next question, Joshua, comes from Frank.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.200]   "Joshua, I'm mentoring a young fellow, hopefully to leave my office and move on to long-term
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.640]   financial independence.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.280]   For the near term, I'm directing him to take as many classes that my employer offers and
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.560]   giving him many projects to work on.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.300]   Long-term, he's having difficulty in focusing on where to direct his energies, true of many
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   young graduates.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.640]   Do you have any shows that specifically address this issue, if not a good show topic?
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.720]   This is a bit easier for older folks.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.080]   I have plenty of life experiences to draw from to decide on a different career or another
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.580]   business altogether.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.120]   But for younger folks, they have so many options that they have a hard time picking one to
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.120]   focus on.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   Do you have any thoughts?
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.120]   Cheers, Frank."
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:17.280]   I think this is an incredibly important issue and it's really difficult in today's world
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.680]   and young people have it really, really tough when it comes to actually being able to make
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.040]   an intelligent decision about this.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.100]   Here's the situation, the practical situation that most young men and women face.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:36.060]   They are told, "Follow your passion," right?
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.200]   This is standard advice.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.420]   I give this advice.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.920]   Other people give this advice.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.800]   It's a cultural context now that we all are told, "Follow your passion.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.400]   Do what you're passionate about."
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.760]   This creates a bunch of people who are saying, "Wait a second.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.960]   What am I passionate about?"
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.400]   Everyone wants to follow their passion.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:58.960]   We're told, "Follow their passion," but the challenge is that â€“ two challenges.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.080]   The first challenge is we're told, "Follow the passion," but we often haven't had
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.720]   to know what it means to follow something.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.840]   I'm thinking here of somebody who's not in the work world.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.760]   Many young men and women have had so many things given to them.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.920]   They don't know the joy of working for something themselves.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:24.840]   The bigger problem is simply that their lives have been very focused on one specific track,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.480]   primarily academics.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.960]   Most people today, young people who are just coming out of the academic context are basically
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.640]   one trick ponies.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.880]   If you look at how many young men and women today are groomed and sheltered, they have
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.480]   a single area of experience.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.160]   I'm certainly stereotyping here, but I think I'm stereotyping to a useful degree where
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.600]   it sets the point.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.880]   If you think about how we groom people, it's all about academics.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.080]   We start them young, get them into the right preschool.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.600]   It's all this competition in high society about getting them into the right preschool.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.360]   They come through and they go through 12 years of schooling in which they're taught, "Prepare
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360]   for college.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   Okay, great, great, great.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.520]   Prepare for college."
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.400]   Academics are held as the key area of focus.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.240]   If it's not academics, then it's sports or it's some area of specific talent that they're
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.600]   focusing on, sports or singing or whatever their thing is.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.960]   So focus on, build academics, then go to college.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.200]   Okay, build academics.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.360]   They come out and they have very little broad-based experience.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   Many times if you talk to young men and women, the little bit of experience that they have
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.040]   came from a context that was on the periphery of their schooling.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.400]   It came from a football camp that they went and they all of a sudden realized that there
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.160]   was this other thing available to them or they went to a sports camp and they realized
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.960]   that they could have this job leading sports camps.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.360]   So the challenge here is exactly what you identified in your question where you said,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.120]   "This is a bit easier for older folks.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:02.160]   I have plenty of life experiences to draw from to decide on a different career or another
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   business altogether."
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.920]   You answered it in your own question.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:15.080]   So I don't have a good answer simply that other than to be aware of yourself and gain
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   experience.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.560]   Now one of the challenges that a lot of people have and I see this changing in popular culture
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.320]   is that we're taught we need to protect our resumes.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.480]   We have to continue to build our resumes.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:31.680]   This oftentimes leads to the very industrious go-getter, 22-year-old graduating from college,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.400]   get the job, build it up in the industry, work, work, work, work, work and then you
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.680]   wind up with this quarter-life crisis in their late 20s where they say, "Wait a second.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.920]   I never had a chance to try different things."
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.400]   I personally encourage people and this is my simple advice is get a broad level of experience
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.680]   and there are a few ways to do that.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.240]   There are ways that are very disruptive and there are ways that are not so disruptive.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.080]   Let's go with least disruptive.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.600]   Take an interest, a broad interest in life.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.960]   I don't know how to do this other than to read.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.840]   I guess the non-reading way to do this would be subscribe to interesting YouTube channels
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.960]   but just follow interests a little bit and go and read and get exposure to different
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   scenarios.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.760]   It's easy for me to go and consider a whole lifestyle and a whole life plan and a whole
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.160]   change that I could make simply by absorbing somebody else's experience.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:32.800]   When you read broadly as a kid, this is â€“ I wish one way you can really help boys and
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:39.160]   girls is give them opportunities to read broadly, especially in fiction where when they can
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.680]   read in the context of fiction, of a diverse types of fiction, they can get exposed to
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.320]   all kinds of different lifestyles, different jobs, different careers, different hobbies.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.960]   It's very easy to access all these different things when you're reading a book about
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.080]   it and those ideas will simmer in your mind.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.880]   I could give you multiple careers that I would be interested in that I know were influenced
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.800]   based upon books that I read.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:09.240]   I would enjoy certain types of private investigator work.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.200]   I would enjoy being a detective on a police force.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.720]   I would enjoy that type of work.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.880]   Now of course, it's not all it's cracked up to be as far as every job involves a large
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.040]   amount of grunt work.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:28.400]   It's not all spies and stakeouts and most stakeouts are pretty boring.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.600]   But I would enjoy the net result of bringing justice to the world.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.040]   I share this deep feeling of a desire for justice.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.760]   So I know that but my exposure to that came through reading Hardy Boy books.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.160]   I was obsessed with Hardy Boy books, really enjoyed it, used to get all kinds of books
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   on private investigator work from the library.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   I read all the techniques.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.880]   I loved military thrillers.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.640]   So I had exposure to this whole field and industry but I never knew anybody who did
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.000]   it and I've discarded it as not something I want to pursue right now.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   But it's there as an option.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.520]   It's on my list of, "Hey, this is a career that I would enjoy."
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.120]   And I would personally â€“ I've met different investigators.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.440]   There are a few different niches that I think would be really interesting.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.560]   I've gained exposure through nonfiction, just simply reading career books, reading
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   different accounts of people, reading biographies.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.800]   I mean you read biographies, you start to gain different people's experiences.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.820]   So this is not disruptive to your life to gain experience vicariously.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.700]   You can also gain experience through just simply exposure to a diverse group of people.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:47.200]   One mistake that many people, especially young people make is you get into your circle of
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.600]   friends or your circle of acquaintances where you're comfortable and they don't branch
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.100]   out.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.680]   We don't do a great job of teaching social skills to young men and women.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.560]   So you put people into a diverse social environment.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.760]   Many people are very uncomfortable.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.160]   Kids are very comfortable with other kids but they often don't know how to talk very
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.260]   well to adults and this transfers on.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.120]   You often see this when â€“ if you look at your company and it sounds like you're working
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   with a young adult but you often see this where you're looking at somebody who doesn't
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.520]   know â€“ they don't know how to walk over and have an intelligent conversation with
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.240]   the CEO of the company.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.640]   All the interns gather together with all the interns.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.000]   Well, that's a silly plan.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.800]   The interns aren't going to give you any life experience that's different than yours.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.000]   Go make friends with other people.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.980]   Also this can happen just through a focused, dedicated plan.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.680]   Just simply by reaching out to people and walking over and smiling and extending your
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.080]   hand and say, "Hi, my name is Joshua."
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.720]   It's really all it takes.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.640]   But somebody like you has to come along and mentor somebody and say, "Listen, you need
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.280]   to expand your experience."
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.420]   Most people have not done something as simple as taking a class on social skills or read
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.800]   a book on social skills or how to be a good conversationalist.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.400]   And so they don't know how to enter into these engagements and they can't gain from
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.180]   other people's experience.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.680]   So all you simply need to do is teach somebody, be interested in somebody else's experience
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.080]   and all of a sudden you'll find all these options open up to you.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.200]   I'll tell a story that specifically relates that happened about 30 minutes ago before
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:31.220]   I hit record on the recorder here.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.160]   Right before I was â€“ I was just sitting down to record this show.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.080]   My wife had taken the kids out for a walk and she had just come back and she said, "Hey,
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.680]   by the way, there is a van down the road and you might want to look at it."
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:49.880]   She knows I have an interest in these â€“ in vans and different ways that they can be configured.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   I like big vans.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.880]   I like campers.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.000]   I have an interest in that.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   It's like it's two doors down.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.040]   You might want to like take a look and see how it's configured.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.800]   I know you have an interest in those things.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.740]   So I humored her and I didn't think I'd be interested.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:08.160]   I walked out and I look â€“ I was just kind of doing this casual stroll by to see what's
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   going on.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   I thought it was a construction van.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.600]   I get closer and realized that the person had a bed in the back and they had built a
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.040]   bed and it was kind of a homespun camper van.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.040]   Well, now that really engaged my interest because I have a weird fascination with living
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.280]   in vehicles.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.680]   So I'm looking at this thing and I go over and talk to them and I make a little comment,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.940]   just a polite introductory comment to see if he wants to talk to me or not and wound
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.220]   up standing there talking to the guy for about 30 minutes.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:43.060]   He is a man who travels all over the US and he sells headlight restoration products and
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.060]   services at flea markets and different places.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.020]   He has the van just very simply fixed up.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.620]   He's got a little air conditioner in there.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.620]   He's got a little bed in the back, a little generator.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.640]   He's got the van fixed up that he can live in it while he travels.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:02.420]   He makes a lot of money going to these flea markets and selling headlight restoration
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420]   and doing headlight restoration.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.700]   He told me how much he made and he makes a lot of money.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:15.900]   I just asked him how and why and all the skills and immediately, I gained access to a whole
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.860]   new different lifestyle that I thought, "Oh, that's really interesting," and I got all
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.300]   the details on how he prices his stuff and how he sells it and how he sets up his booth
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.420]   and how he does it and we looked at the products and now I've got another business idea as
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.140]   a backup business idea to file away in the back of my head if I ever need it.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.320]   I can take that and as I walked home, I was thinking, "Oh, here's another thing that
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   could be applied."
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.340]   Well, if I knew a young person that were looking for â€“ let's say that they knew they had
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:51.700]   a passion for windsurfing or paddleboarding and they want to kayak all over the place
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.020]   but they need a way to make a living on the road.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:59.020]   Well, here's a business that with the right skill and the right experience can be established
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.420]   and this guy makes a ton of money and he works on his own schedule.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.180]   He just identifies the shows where he wants to go and lives this itinerant lifestyle.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.740]   So the point of that story is to say that a little bit of interest in somebody, a little
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:18.340]   bit of conversation skill to ask somebody some engaging questions so they open up and
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.740]   all of a sudden, here's a whole another lifestyle that I have exposure to that I can
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.820]   take and incorporate in.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.340]   This is not hard to learn.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.340]   Anybody can do it.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.920]   It just takes taking an active interest in other people.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.300]   That doesn't â€“ it's not disruptive to your life.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.340]   Volunteering in different organizations as a way of testing things or volunteering in
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.140]   different â€“ trying different activities as a way of trying things and being exposed
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.640]   to things is another excellent, less disruptive way to do it.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.860]   Go and try new hobbies.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.300]   Go and take a class in something that you have never had exposure to.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:59.520]   The famous example of this, of how these things build over time is Steve Jobs and his calligraphy
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.900]   courses in college which then went on to affect his design ethic for the rest of his life.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:11.700]   In the Apple design, you still see the impact of it from him taking somewhat happens â€“ by
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.340]   happenstance a calligraphy class.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.540]   So encourage the young man to try different things.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.700]   Try different things with no intention of finishing them.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.940]   Just address different things.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:21.940]   Take some classes.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.940]   Go join some clubs.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.020]   Go to some local meetups.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.540]   Meet some different people from a diverse background.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.900]   This helps him to gain experience from other people.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.920]   Then you can get to the base place where you start to change jobs.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.820]   Working different jobs I think is very important.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:47.140]   I don't see how it's possible in a work environment to know yourself without having
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.140]   been exposed to different approaches.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.360]   You want to work for good bosses and bad bosses.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   You want to work at constraining companies and free companies.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.140]   You want to work at jobs from different perspectives.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.720]   If you can get that exposure over time, it makes a huge difference.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.480]   One of the biggest benefits that I had was that my parents put a lot of work into giving
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.580]   me the opportunity to be exposed to different jobs and that helped me.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:18.860]   I've always felt like I know myself much more than most of my peers know themselves.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.940]   I understand who I am, what I like, what are good fits, what's a good fit, what's not.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.020]   I understand my values, my vision, all of those things much better.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.220]   Well, it just comes from working different jobs.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.700]   I don't know that experience can be fully gained vicariously.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.780]   I think a lot of it's got to be done personally.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.900]   Experience is the common advice is they don't come by accident.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.060]   They come from exposure.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:52.420]   Those are some ideas of some ways that you can encourage this young man to get some experience
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:27:00.420]   so that they are able to make a better decision.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:06.540]   Again, I quote from your note, "This is a bit easier for older folks.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.220]   I have plenty of life experiences to draw from to decide on a different career or another
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.300]   business altogether.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.180]   But for younger folks, they have so many options that they have a hard time picking one to
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.940]   focus on."
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:23.020]   The reason they have a hard time is because they have very little experience.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.020]   Next question comes from Tyler.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.660]   "Hey, Joshua, would you describe your note-taking for books?
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.820]   I follow you on Instagram and I noticed that you use a combination of various colors of
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.420]   highlighters underlining with a pen, stars.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.380]   I'd love to get more out of the books I read based on what you recommend on the podcast.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.740]   Any method of the madness?
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.100]   Thank you for all that you do and for being the best personal financial teacher around.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.100]   Kindly, Tyler."
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.420]   Tyler, thank you for the compliment.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.420]   I do sometimes.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.420]   I like to post quotes.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.620]   I go on Kix.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.500]   Sometimes I post a bunch and sometimes I don't post for a long time.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.460]   But I post quotes and interesting things I read on Instagram.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.460]   You're welcome if any of you are Instagrammers.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.620]   @JoshuaSheets, spelled S-H-E-A-T-S, you can find me there.
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.020]   I post pictures of my kids and pictures of things that I read.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.380]   But Tyler, I have a very simple system.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.860]   I would not â€“ if you hadn't asked me the question, I wouldn't personally have tried
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.980]   to teach the subject.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.540]   I don't think I'm particularly brilliant at this.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.980]   I'll just tell you what my system is.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.100]   But I have a very simple system but I do have a little bit of thought behind it.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.620]   First, I read paper books.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.260]   I don't read e-books.
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:29.020]   I find that reading on a phone or a computer or an iPad or whatever is way too distracting.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:34.980]   Now, of course, that's not to say that there's not a place for that.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.980]   Reading novels, that's fine.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:42.540]   But when I want to read a nonfiction book, I just â€“ I found that my level of attention
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.100]   span has suffered so much over the last decade and I've been working really hard to get
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.100]   it back.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.500]   It really bothered me because I used to be a really good student.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.420]   I could sit down with a nonfiction book, go cover to cover, not get distracted, not get
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.740]   â€“ just not get distracted.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:04.660]   Over the last decade, I lost a lot of that skill and that really frustrates me because
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:12.420]   in order for me to feel confident with the work that I'm trying to do, I need to be
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.860]   an excellent student.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.620]   And so I've been working hard to regain that focus.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:22.820]   One of the things is I need to read in a focused way where I am not distracted by dings and
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.780]   anything.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:31.100]   Reading on a device, reading on my phone or whatever, it's just too easy to flip to
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.100]   something else.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.060]   It's too easy to follow that path and look up that word, etc.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.380]   So I like to read on a paper book.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.020]   I try to leave the phone and the computer in the other room, that kind of thing.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.300]   That way, I can stay focused.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:48.340]   Paper books, I've made this decision that I want to be able to destroy the books that
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.620]   I read with my â€“ they call it marginalia.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.420]   Marginalia, the stuff that you put in the margin.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.580]   So I like to â€“ I want to destroy the books that I read with my marginalia.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.100]   So I don't get nonfiction books from the library unless I'm just going to just flip
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.100]   through them.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.860]   I just buy them used on Amazon.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:12.020]   Amazon used book marketplace is so fantastic and at this point in time, it's usually
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.260]   you can find a book for a buck plus $3.99 shipping.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.600]   Paying four bucks or eight bucks or whatever for a book is relatively inconsequential.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.320]   So I try to just get the book, had it shipped to my house and it's done.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.460]   So getting them used on Amazon helps me and then I can destroy it.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.460]   I can write in it.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.580]   I can keep my notes, etc.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.860]   I am a â€“ well, I always write my name on the book.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.700]   I've gone to the point of trying not to lend out books.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.420]   I'd rather just buy somebody a copy than lend the book.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:47.300]   It's not the most frugal thing but I want â€“ it's important to keep my books.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.980]   I write my name and I write the date that I read it the first time and if I come back
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.260]   through again, I write the date that I read it again.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:59.260]   So if it's April 2016, I'll write just this morning, I'm starting a new book.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.820]   May 2016, I'll write in the front cover of the book.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:08.540]   I am a generous highlighter and I do it for a couple of reasons.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.820]   I do it to help me pay attention.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.660]   By having something in my hand, I'm more focused and I'm less distractible and that's
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.580]   helping me to regain and rebuild my â€“ the skill of reading, rebuild the attention span
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.060]   that I used to have.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.380]   I don't â€“ so that's the first reason.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.940]   The second reason that I highlight is that I want to be able to simply skim my highlighting
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.500]   if I want to absorb the book in the future.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.680]   I'm unlikely to read most books twice.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.220]   Most books are simply not great books.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.100]   Great books are books you're going to return to again and again.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.300]   Well, most books, you're not going to return to them.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.220]   But if I am going to return to them, I just usually want to just skim my highlighting.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:55.580]   And so I do highlight extensively to the point where if highlighting is just intended to
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.620]   bring attention to the important things, I probably overdo it.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.260]   But it helps me and I like it because then I can come back and I can just skim the highlighting
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.820]   and get all of the important points from the book.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.340]   There's no method to the color of highlighting.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.260]   That method is just simply I buy highlighters and they usually come in packs of whatever.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.980]   So whatever one is not run out at the moment.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.060]   A lot of my books will have four or five colors in them.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.940]   There's no method or color coding to the highlighting.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.100]   I do also sometimes underline important points as well.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:31.900]   I will â€“ in my marginalia system, I will outline books sometimes as they go.
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.180]   So if they're pointing one, two, three, I will just put a little one, two, three.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.580]   So that way I can come back and just real quick look here.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.180]   Those are the one, two, three points.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:51.180]   I also will â€“ well, I also try to converse with the author as I read.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.700]   I think of books as a conversation between me and the author and I try to argue with
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.700]   authors.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.740]   I think authors are the best people to argue with.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.700]   So generally because you don't hurt their feelings when you disagree with them.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.580]   So I write down the questions.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.140]   I make comments.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.620]   I point down things that I'm thinking of.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:13.460]   I try to just keep a note of my thoughts on the page so that â€“ again, helping me stay
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.980]   focused and helping me to interact with it.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:23.340]   All the highlighting and the marks also help me to know how far I got in a book.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.460]   I have a habit.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.140]   I don't know whether it's good or bad.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.540]   It just is but I'm often reading multiple books at once.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:36.620]   I'd probably say I'm reading â€“ there's about nine books on my desk right now.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.620]   I don't finish all the books.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.940]   I try to follow a little bit of my interest when I'm reading and a lot of it is based
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.940]   upon mood.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.180]   If I'm going to read something heavy or if I'm going to read something light, I
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.780]   just go based upon the mood.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   So I don't finish all the books.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.980]   There's no reason to finish all the books.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.100]   If a book is not worth finishing, just dump it and move on.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.180]   I circle words I don't understand.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.180]   So if it's a new word, I always circle it.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.700]   I look it up and then I write the definition at the bottom of the page.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:10.740]   That helps to build my vocabulary and it helps me to make sure that I'm engaging with it
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.340]   and really understanding.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.020]   Then sometimes I'll write notes, takeaways, actions, questions in the covers.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.380]   Then if I'm really a good student, which usually I flake out and move on to the next
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:25.500]   point, then I'll try to outline and put a little something in the covers.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.820]   So I just flip to the back cover and I write the notes, takeaways.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.580]   I use a simple system of if there's a question that I have about something, I'll write
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.900]   a big question mark.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:40.340]   If I have an action step, I'll write a checkbox there that helps me to take an action step.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.980]   Those are the two basic symbols that I usually use.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.500]   So if somebody references in the bibliography this other book and I say, "Hey, that sounds
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.500]   interesting.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:54.720]   I want to go and follow that book up."
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.540]   So that's my system I guess.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.540]   Not fancy.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:04.460]   I'm not going to claim that it's great even but that's the system.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.820]   I will conclude with this question simply that reading is a skill and it's a skill
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.020]   that has to be developed consciously and proactively.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:18.920]   If you can read it and if you can get through it, a good place to start is the classic book
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.020]   by Mortimer Adler called How to Read a Book.
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.540]   The reason I say if you can get through it is because the majority of people who would
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.060]   probably consider themselves fluent readers can't get through the book because it's
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.700]   just a totally different style and a totally different approach.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.580]   It makes you think just to read the book on how to read a book.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:42.460]   The major takeaway and the major premise is simply that reading is a skill that has to
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.980]   be developed.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:50.260]   The unfortunate case of what you see is that the vast majority of people are illiterate.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:57.140]   They might be able to read but they can't gain the information and grasp from the book.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:02.940]   So what I would encourage you is don't be â€“ if you're working to become a more
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:08.380]   skillful reader, expect it to take time and don't expect it to come easily.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:15.940]   You will have to work with books and your fluency with different books will vary depending
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:22.900]   on the subject matter.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.740]   So when you're reading something that's a subject that you're very familiar with,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.140]   you can jump through it.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.780]   If you're reading a subject matter that you're not familiar with, you can â€“ it's
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.780]   going to take you some time.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.180]   I'm going to go ahead and â€“ there's a question further down my list.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.740]   I'm going to go ahead and pull it in here because it's relevant to what I'm saying
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.740]   here.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.740]   It comes in from Alan.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.540]   He says, "Josh, I'd like your thoughts on if you recommend gulping or savoring information.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.940]   Savoring is reading many books at the same time, sort of skimming and grabbing the golden
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.180]   nuggets, listening to many, many podcasts, reading book summaries, etc.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.180]   Savoring is slowly engorging yourself in a single topic at one time, perhaps reading
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.740]   one single book at a time and only listening to podcasts on that same topic while reading
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.740]   it.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.860]   I tend to savor stuff but I saw an interesting video by Tai Lopez on this where he says he
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.020]   prefers gulping.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.980]   He has a point and he seems to be quite successful."
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:15.740]   So tying in to that question and â€“ because it's important.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.900]   The skill of reading is developed over time and you're going to want to apply that skill
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.440]   depending â€“ differently.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.780]   So there's an initial stage.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:31.540]   I think kids should read a lot of fiction to build a love for reading.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:36.700]   Maybe there's a better way but I find that fiction is the way that you get people engaged.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.700]   So if you're not a reader at all, you might want to just start by reading fiction and
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.900]   not necessarily read nonfiction.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.820]   But find some books, find some genres, find some things that engage you and build that
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.440]   basic skill of being able to understand the words and being able to read quickly.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.220]   If you get to that point, then you'll be able to read quickly.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.900]   In fiction, you can build your reading speed.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.900]   I can sit down.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.620]   I don't allow myself to read a military thriller except if I'm on vacation.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.420]   I know I'm going to have time to read because it destroys my life.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.740]   I find it difficult to put down.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.900]   But when I was younger, it was Tom Clancy.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:17.620]   I always had a soft spot even though the novels were just terribly repetitive for Clive Custler.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:23.980]   Today it might be Brad Thor or who's the other guy, the guy that died in that genre.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.420]   There are some really great writers writing this type of â€“ this fiction.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:34.380]   Well, I could sit down with a thousand-page Clancy book and get through that in a couple
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.540]   days on vacation if I've got time to read during the day.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.020]   My lifestyle is different now that I have kids.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:46.180]   So you can learn to read very quickly when you're reading a subject that you are engaging
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.180]   with.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.740]   That's the basic level of skill.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.900]   Then you go over to the level of skill of engaging with the content and the topic.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:57.620]   And so here's where I think it's important to learn the skill of gulping and reading
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.740]   a lot of different books from a lot of different genre and also savoring.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.420]   And here's my answer to Alan's question.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.900]   They're both important.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:12.380]   My personal practice is to gulp a lot of information from a lot of different genres simply based
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.380]   upon interest.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:20.900]   I just go to the library, check out 30 books, 40 books, browse through them, browse through
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.900]   the books at the bookstore and you can look through â€“ the majority of nonfiction books
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.900]   are a few hundred pages.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.980]   You can look through them in about 15 minutes, grasp a lot of what they're about.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.860]   Gulping is good to get exposure to a diverse area of topics.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.820]   But gulping is useless if you actually want to do anything with the information.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.460]   The danger with gulping, and I'm susceptible to this, is that you're always taking in
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.860]   and never doing anything.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.200]   If nothing changes in your life, you're no better.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.100]   So if you're reading a book on a subject, you don't actually do something with the
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.100]   information.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.700]   It hasn't actually done anything more than give you information.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.220]   And so Tai Lopez, his claim to read a book a day is silly.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.580]   You're not reading a book a day.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.180]   You're skimming a book a day.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.180]   I can do that.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.180]   Anybody can do that.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.180]   But you don't retain the information.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.860]   You just get exposure to a diverse area of topics.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.500]   If you don't follow that up with savoring, with an intense focus into a different area,
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.340]   you don't wind up with anything â€“ you can't really make an impact.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.740]   So the specialists are usually the ones who make an impact.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.500]   And so we're always balancing that generalized knowledge with the specialist knowledge and
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.340]   it's good to bring these two together.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.420]   So you choose an area, a focus based upon the impact that you're trying to make.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.660]   Now this could be something related to a goal that you have.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.840]   This could be something that's related to the business that you're in, to a cause
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.700]   that you're working in, to something that's important to you.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:51.180]   And then you dig deep and you focus on consuming the majority of the literature that's within
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.420]   that genre.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.820]   And that's where you should slow down your reading speed, where you should engage much
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:01.980]   more seriously and critically with the topics and not try to just go through lots of things.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.220]   You should read systematically.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.420]   In almost any field, if you would just read systematically through a dozen books in that
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.940]   area, you'll be a world-class leading expert.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:16.140]   There's almost no topic that you can't become a world-class leading expert to.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:23.660]   And if you apply this to a few areas, it can â€“ people think you're really smart.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.380]   You say, "I'm not smart.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.820]   I just read a book on it.
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.020]   I just read a dozen books on it."
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.620]   So I think that you do have to choose and then once you choose an area, you dig into
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.620]   it.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.820]   So those are my thoughts on the reading system.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.620]   Let's do one or two more.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:43.700]   This comes from Joseph says, "Joshua, I was listening to your podcast about Roth versus
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.300]   traditional the other day and there was something that was bothering me about your explanation.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.140]   I like the fact that you're bringing light to a common misconception.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.620]   It seriously drives me nuts when people claim that you don't pay taxes on the gains in
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.740]   a Roth.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:00.300]   But your math is based off of a faulty assumption, which is that you will be paying the same
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.500]   effective tax on your contributions as your withdrawals.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.260]   The problem is that the taxes that you pay on a Roth are at the marginal tax rate at
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.100]   the time of earning and the taxes that you pay on a traditional are at the effective
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.140]   tax rate at the time of withdrawal.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.940]   You said effective for both, but the way you were talking about it, it almost sounded like
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.660]   you meant marginal.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:27.180]   The main difference is that all of the money is contributed at the highest tax bracket,
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.260]   but money being withdrawn has the benefit of receiving a new standard deduction and
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.900]   personal exemption as well as being able to take advantage of the 10% and 15% tax brackets
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.300]   each year.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:47.220]   So while an individual making $60,000 might pay a marginal tax rate of 25% on that $5,500
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:54.860]   contribution to a Roth, an individual withdrawing $60,000 will pay $0 on the first $10,300,
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:08.860]   10% on the next $9,275, 15% on the next $28,375, and 25% on the last $12,050.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:18.820]   That totals to $8,196.25 on $60,000 for an effective tax rate of 13.7%.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:24.420]   Because of our progressive tax system, someone in the 25% tax bracket can never have an effective
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.460]   tax of 25%.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:33.540]   They will need to be withdrawing enough money to get into the 33% tax bracket to pay a 25%
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.540]   effective rate.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.860]   I just wanted to point this out because I thought that it might confuse some listeners.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.940]   I thought it might be beneficial for you to clarify this point.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.460]   Joseph, you are absolutely correct.
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.980]   That's exactly the case.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.340]   That's exactly the math behind it.
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.060]   I regret ever doing that show.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.980]   That show was a spur of the moment show.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.500]   I sat down and I said, "You know what?
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.260]   I'm trying to figure out what's the right type of show to create for Radical Personal
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.260]   Finance.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.340]   I create sometimes these just huge long shows.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.620]   I'm just going to create one short show on one specific topic.
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.620]   I'm going to be laser-focused.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.980]   I'm not going to dig into the Roth versus IRA question.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.740]   I'm just going to point out that the math is the same."
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:26.940]   So I sat down to do the show and I have received more feedback from listeners on that show
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:33.500]   about all the things I left out than any show in a while.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:41.660]   I regret doing it because it makes me think I just got to create these mountains of shows,
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.660]   every pro and every con.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.380]   I guess that's kind of the style I've developed here.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.880]   But you are absolutely correct.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.380]   What this points out â€“ so just in summary, I'll just summarize it.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:45:00.020]   When you put money â€“ when you defer money using an IRA, a traditional IRA, you're
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:05.900]   deferring money at the highest possible marginal rate.
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:12.220]   Later when you take it out, you're probably going to be taking it out at a lower rate.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:20.620]   This is why mathematically, I think most listeners will almost always be better off with some
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:29.060]   sort of system of a traditional IRA or traditional 401(k) as compared to the Roth.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.820]   For many people, this would be one reason.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:36.420]   I'm generally not in favor of something like a Roth 401(k) contribution.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.520]   Now the problem is there are so many other factors.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.420]   What is the actual tax rate that the person is in?
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.260]   What are their plans for their career?
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.020]   What other assets and resources do they have?
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:56.620]   Simple example, I think there's a very compelling argument to be made for people putting money
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.880]   into the Roth IRA simply that they can get it out again if they need it.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:06.860]   So you can use a Roth IRA and you have simple access to your contributions if you have an
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.860]   emergency.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.280]   That's really powerful and really compelling.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:16.420]   So â€“ but mathematically, I think that most people will be better off using a deferred
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.420]   system.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:21.380]   Now I've tried to actually figure out if I could figure â€“ find a way to prove this.
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.020]   I've never found anybody who has done the simulations.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.140]   I invite you very smart listeners to do it and send it to me or to show me where somebody
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.140]   has done it.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:36.620]   But what I would like to see is somebody do a simulation and see if it's even possible
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.420]   to come out ahead with Roth contributions.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.660]   So for example, run it as a Roth 401(k) versus a traditional 401(k), to come out ahead with
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:52.420]   Roth contributions under normal circumstances and under the same tax rates and tax chain
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.740]   codes that we have.
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:59.980]   The reason why I can't just do the analysis is for the reasons that you said here, Joseph.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.780]   But what I would love to see modeled â€“ and I know there's some tax software.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:07.580]   At one point, I tried to look for some and I tried to â€“ I did a â€“ to get some complex
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.180]   tax software to do it.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:16.420]   But I'd love to see it modeled to say â€“ let's say you have somebody who is working â€“ take
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.900]   median plus 50 percent.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:24.380]   So let's just say that a $75,000-a-year job, median income I think is somewhere around
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.380]   $52,000 currently.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.380]   Take a $75,000, $80,000 a year.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:36.700]   Put â€“ save $15,000 and model it with a traditional 401(k) contribution and then model it with
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:43.420]   a Roth 401(k) contribution and then model the distributions throughout the retirement
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.820]   and tell me the total taxes paid on either of them.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.660]   The reason it's so complicated, I can easily get to the balance.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.040]   I can do that in a minute.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.500]   But what I can't do is I can't model the standard deduction.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.060]   I can't model the brackets.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.300]   I can't model the social security income, et cetera.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:05.500]   I can't model those things easily enough to get a good handle on it.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:11.180]   But I think the Roth, most people, if they're prioritizing Roth contributions, most people
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:16.780]   would be paying a far higher tax â€“ total taxes than using the traditional scenario
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.220]   for the reasons you said.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:25.320]   It's really difficult to know how to convey that to somebody because it's got to be
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.660]   done on an individual basis.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:36.900]   Most people are not going to accrue portfolios that are going to leave them in a larger income
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.260]   bracket at retirement.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.440]   That's the simplest way to sum up the point.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:51.000]   If you look at what would be required to pay â€“ if you look at what would be required
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   for the Roth IRA â€“ for the Roth 401(k) to be better than a traditional 401(k), you would
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:10.080]   have to model a system where in retirement, somebody is receiving more money, perhaps
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.220]   even substantially more money as their retirement income than they were during their working
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.760]   income or during their working years.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.840]   That's just simply impractical.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:27.020]   It's not going to â€“ it's not going to happen for mainstream savers.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.520]   Some of you extreme savers, could it happen?
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.520]   Yes.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.720]   Somebody who's built â€“ building a great business and experiencing substantial â€“ yes,
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   you guys are the outliers.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.640]   But for the mainstream saver, that's not going to happen.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:46.600]   Just the common life cycle of the common person, you don't make more money in retirement.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.800]   You need more money earlier in life because you have more years of life to fund.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   You have higher expenses.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.760]   You have higher lifestyle expenses, family expenses, et cetera.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.480]   The retirement years, you often need less.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:03.400]   The people who don't need less are the ones who are living a high retirement lifestyle
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:09.160]   based upon intentionality and I think it's something that the financial planning industry
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.120]   doesn't talk about enough.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.760]   So I invite any listener who has the tax software that can â€“ if you can model that.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:21.960]   If you can model it for me, say from 40 to 65 and then model the distributions, model
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:27.800]   in retirement â€“ excuse me, social security income and use current tax expectations, current
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.320]   tax rates, current tax brackets and model that for me through retirement, I would love
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.320]   to see that.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.680]   I've never been able to build it myself.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   I'd love to see it.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:43.840]   The reason that this is often pushed down â€“ I apologize for the dog barking.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.480]   My software should moderate the sound so it won't blow out your eardrums but I don't
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.800]   have time to edit that today.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:54.760]   The reason I don't buy the arguments about â€“ the major argument that people make is
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.160]   well, remember, tax breaks are going to go up in the future.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.840]   After all, we have this major â€“ we have all this major debt.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.920]   We have all this major â€“ we're going to have to raise taxes in the future.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.280]   That's the argument that the people make.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.200]   Personally, I have no crystal ball.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   I am unconvinced of those arguments.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:19.360]   I don't think that â€“ number one, I don't think that debt will ever, ever be paid.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.560]   It's simply never going to be paid, neither the official on-budget debt nor the unfunded
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   liabilities.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.280]   I see no way for it to be paid.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:37.200]   Second, I see no way that the US American population is going to accept any major changes
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.280]   in tax rates.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.920]   We could play some games at the corners.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.440]   We could play the political games about the 1%, blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:51.200]   They'll change it 5%, 10% but everybody agrees.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.680]   The Democrats and the Republicans all agree that raising taxes is a bad idea for business.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.960]   It's just a matter of what they argue about in the election cycle.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.040]   But the reality is when times get tough, they know they got to cut taxes.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.420]   The actual effective taxes across the country have been 20% of GDP and they haven't changed
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.420]   in decades.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:15.000]   So, when I look at that chart and I say, "Okay, put aside all the four-year â€“ every four-year
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.720]   arguments that obsess people during election season.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.320]   Put aside all the talk that gets votes and look at what people actually do," I don't
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.600]   see it happening.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:31.560]   So I don't think we should â€“ I don't think that that should be the compelling reason.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.480]   Ed Slott makes a big deal of this of get all the money out into the Roth.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   I'm going to have him on someday and talk about that.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.960]   But I don't buy the argument anymore.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   Let's do one more and â€“ no.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:47.320]   I'm going to quit for the day there since I did that other extra question.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:55.680]   We're going to save this question about how to fit in in a military context without
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.480]   breaking your budget for another Q&A show.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.440]   Thank you all so much for listening today.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.440]   Thank you for listening.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.360]   I apologize if my delivery wasn't as smooth.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.400]   I've been out of commission the last few days.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:12.320]   That's why there's been such a paucity of shows and so I'm working on getting
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.800]   back to that.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.920]   Sorry about the dog barking.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   Podcasting is real.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:22.800]   Again, if you'd like to have me answer a question from you on a show like this, feel
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.160]   free to send it in to me.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.040]   You can use the contact form on the website at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.040]   That's a great way to get the question in to me.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.880]   Happy to hear from you at any point in time.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.600]   Thank you to those of you who are patrons of the show, supporting the show on Patreon.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.880]   Super, super important to me, especially right now.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.160]   If you gain value and benefit from this show, please consider becoming a patron.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:50.520]   I don't like to oversell it, overemphasize it, and turn the whole show into a pledge
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.520]   drive.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.240]   Just know that, put simply, it's very important.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   It's helpful to me.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.640]   It's very important to me.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:01.520]   If you benefit from the content that I distribute on the show for free, please consider becoming
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.520]   a patron.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.520]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.760]   A couple of benefits there for you.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.040]   Hey, one quick thing as we go.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:12.080]   I need to do a standalone question.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:17.480]   Either way, if you would like to be of help to me, I don't like to make the show all about
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   "Hey, here's how you can help me."
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.320]   But I know many of you write to me and say, "Hey, is there something that you can do?"
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.200]   Reviews for the show would be extremely useful in a couple of different places.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.720]   First, if you listen on an Apple device, please do a review on iTunes.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.840]   That's super, super important.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.360]   The reason it's important, it helps a little bit with rankings and activity.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.740]   But the reason it's important is new listeners will come through and they'll browse the shows
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.320]   and they judge based upon the number of reviews.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.600]   I haven't focused heavily on trying to get lots of reviews, and so I could gain a lot
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   more.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.320]   So please, one or two sentences is all that's needed.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.800]   You can do it right on your phone.
