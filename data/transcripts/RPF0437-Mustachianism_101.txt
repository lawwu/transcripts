[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.420]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, Mustachianism 101, the philosophy of popular personal finance
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:29.700]   writer, Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.060]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.820]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.340]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I am your host.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.100]   Today we're going to talk about the philosophy of one of the leading personal finance writers
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.620]   online today who is very committed to the second part, well both parts, but especially
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:02.100]   that financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.220]   I had promised this show a while ago in my recent episode where I interviewed Mr. Money
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.220]   Mustache.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.260]   I ran it up with him in Gainesville a few weeks ago and was able to sit down and finally
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.260]   get him on the microphone.
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.100]   It was probably the most requested interview.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.340]   It was episode 425 of the show if you'd like to go back and listen to it.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.980]   It was the most requested interview where many of you wanted me to speak to him.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.820]   Mr. Money Mustache's name is Pete if you're interested.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.260]   But Pete said when I'd reached out to him several times he had done a bunch of interviews
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.700]   and he just wasn't interested in kind of rehashing the same old, same old.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.380]   So finally I was able to catch up with him in Gainesville and I promised him, I said
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.660]   I won't make you go through and talk about what you say on the blog.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.140]   I won't make you do it.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.580]   What we'll just do is I just want to hear about what's going on currently.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.260]   So that's why the tenor of that interview, episode 425, was not about his philosophy.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.100]   It wasn't about what he does.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620]   It wasn't about even what he writes about.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.260]   It was about him as a person because many of you will really, you're already familiar
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.960]   with his philosophy and what he teaches.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.580]   But Pete has been an internet publishing sensation, especially in the world of personal finance.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.320]   There are many, there are from time to time new personalities come along, new people come
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.380]   along and speak to people.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.420]   And on a comparison of a scale, there would be no comparison between the impact thus far
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.500]   anyway of somebody like Mr. Money Mustache and his website as compared to say a Robert
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.340]   Kiyosaki of Rich Dad Poor Dad fame or of who else.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.060]   I mean there are from time – there are other much more widely known personal finance pundits,
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.440]   somebody like David Bach from The Automatic Millionaire.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.420]   These people have affected many huge, huge audiences, much, much bigger than Mr. Money
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.460]   Mustache's audience.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.060]   However, Mr. Money Mustache has not gone out and tried to market his message.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.660]   So with regard to a grassroots message where you just have a guy sitting down typing some
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.380]   stuff into his computer, it's hard for me to find somebody in the finance space who
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.700]   has had such a big impact.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.260]   It's really hard.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.220]   Pete to his credit has been – had a very authentic story and he has just simply sat
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.260]   down and written out his stuff and people have found it because it was good.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.140]   One of the beauties of the internet.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.980]   And today, I'm going to tell you a little bit about his philosophy, summarize what he
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.320]   teaches so that you can be aware because as even I interviewed many people who were there
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.460]   gathered for his conference or the conference that his community was putting on for him,
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.580]   many people were focusing and saying, "I'm a mustachian."
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.320]   So let me explain what mustachianism means.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.540]   Before I explain the philosophy of Mr. Money Mustache though, sponsor of today's show
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.740]   is Paladin Registry.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.180]   Paladin is the go-to place for you to start your search for a financial advisor.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.620]   Now here's the catch.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.980]   Some financial advisors will probably hold and be aware of some of the teachings of somebody
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.800]   like Mr. Money Mustache or somebody like Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.900]   Many of them won't be and that's one of the biggest challenges to finding a great financial
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.220]   advisor today.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.660]   Most financial advisors are excellent in what I call the mainstream.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.900]   They're not going to tell you to sell your car and ride a bicycle but they will help
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.700]   you figure out how to properly allocate your portfolio and how to draw income out of it
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   from retirement.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.860]   I think there's a place for both and I'd love to see more mustachian financial advisors
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.260]   emerge.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.380]   But there are a ton of very competent financial advisors who are skilled planners and advisors
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.220]   and there's no reason why you can't take the knowledge that you bring from the perspective
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.700]   of Radical Personal Finance or Mr. Money Mustache, this type of hardcore stuff and integrate
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.860]   that with mainstream financial planning techniques.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.580]   It's one thing to say I'm going to sell my car and buy a bike.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.580]   That's great.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.500]   It's another thing to figure out how do I live off of a portfolio for the next 30 years
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.460]   when I don't have several million dollars extra and I got to make sure that I structure
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.380]   this thing properly.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.060]   For that, consider starting a search for a good advisor at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.

[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.980]   out to you.

[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.780]   a good place to start your process.

[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   Thank you very much.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   All right.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.740]   The philosophy of Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.620]   The story of mustachianism very much parallels Pete's own experience.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.500]   He is originally from Canada, and even his financial journey parallels much of the advice
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.260]   that he gives.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.500]   He had, in many ways, a normal upbringing in Canada.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.140]   He was born to a couple of good parents.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.020]   He had a very straightforward education.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.580]   He studied computer science in school, graduated out of college at the normal 22 years old,
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.700]   and got his first job.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.980]   He started off on a good, solid foundation, but he was not rich.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.980]   He didn't have any debt.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.460]   He didn't have any savings.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.040]   As he talks about in his writing, he graduated with a bike and a backpack and a diploma.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.360]   He did not have any student loans, which was a tremendous benefit to him and also should
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.060]   be to all of us.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.100]   But he started off with no student loans.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.500]   He had a little bit of help from his parents.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   He got his scholarships.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.700]   He had various high school and summer jobs, all of which helped him to start on a solid
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.740]   foundation.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.780]   He came on down to the United States and, as he would tell, made many of the mistakes
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:35.060]   that many people make when starting off their life, buying fancy cars, going around and
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.660]   spending lots of money at bars and restaurants and basically living the good life.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.140]   But over time, he did work really hard and he did get some raises of his income, transition
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:52.260]   jobs, and he always worked to keep his housing expenses relatively low by sharing roommates.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.820]   So over time, he and his wife got together.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.940]   At some point in time, they married.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:04.100]   Both of them continued to live on a relatively small amount of money while earning good professional
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.940]   incomes and being without children.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:12.340]   So in that context, they were able to save a significant percentage of their income.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.900]   Along the way, he dabbled in some real estate on the side.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:21.540]   He had a part-time business building houses and was able to put himself in a situation
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.100]   by working on some construction projects and also renting out some houses.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.700]   That led to the point where, after about nine or ten years from graduating college at about
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:36.180]   22 – it's called out at age 30, 31 – they officially declared themselves retired.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:43.660]   They'd been able to save over that period of time somewhere around $800,000 and, I believe,
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.220]   pay off their original house.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.140]   Because of their skill with spending a relatively low amount of money, they were able to consider
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.260]   themselves retired with that $800,000 portfolio.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.020]   Pete subscribes strongly to the theory of the 4% rule.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:08.540]   The idea of a 4% rule is if you have a portfolio of mutual funds and stocks, you can reliably
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.920]   withdraw about 4% of the value from that portfolio into perpetuity.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.300]   So that means that with an $800,000 portfolio and a paid-off house, he and his wife were
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.540]   planning on living on an income of about $32,000 per year to cover their expenses.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.460]   And to put themselves in that situation, as long as they had that money, they considered
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.540]   themselves retired.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.980]   They were able to retire by the age of about 31 before they had their first child.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.620]   Since then – that's been a number of years ago – things have continued to go on.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.140]   He's moved, sold his house that he was living in, renovated another house.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.980]   He and his wife have continued to pursue all kinds of different projects.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.660]   He works on his blog.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.940]   He does some building stuff that he enjoys.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.940]   They have at times done home education for their son.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.920]   They spend a lot of time with their son.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.100]   His wife runs a small business on the side.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.960]   And life is pretty good.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:11.940]   He started writing his blog back in – his first post was made in April of 2011.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.020]   Since that time, the blog itself has become a significant business.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.580]   He releases numbers as far as his earnings in various places, at least he has in the
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.580]   recent years.
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.980]   Say he earns probably about a half a million dollars a year of profit from his blog, primarily
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.540]   from advertising.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.360]   If he wanted to – now remember, he has the number one personal finance blog on the internet
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.180]   that I'm aware of.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.620]   And if he – it is not optimized for making money.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:43.380]   If he actually sought to optimize it and make money, he could make a lot more money off
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.380]   of it than he does.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.540]   He does his – his revenues come in in a very unobtrusive way and that fits his personal
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.980]   philosophy.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.660]   So I'm going to explain to you a few of the things that you need to know about the
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.500]   philosophy and a few of the areas that are understated.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.940]   I'm going to walk through some of these major things and also tell you for whom does
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.100]   this philosophy work and for whom does it not work.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:12.860]   It's important that you recognize up front that by all accounts, my own testimony included,
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.500]   it is who he says he is.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.020]   He is a genuine guy.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:22.740]   The guy that you meet in person is exactly the same guy that you meet online.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.500]   I have seen him a few times.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.340]   Started when – a few years ago, immediately after I had left my – closed my financial
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.540]   planning business to start Radical Personal Finance, I traveled out to Colorado and to
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.540]   visit my family.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.020]   I wanted to go out and visit my grandmother.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.300]   And so my wife and I, we traveled out there and we were on our way passing up through
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.700]   from Denver headed north into Wyoming, which would be passing through where he lives in
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.080]   Longmont, Colorado.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.740]   And so I sent him a note and said, "Hey, I'm coming through town.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.260]   Could I come by and connect with you?"
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.260]   And he said yes.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.620]   He was very gracious about that.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.620]   And my wife and son and I went by.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.700]   We spent the evening with a couple of other of his readers.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.500]   He had scheduled a public event and a couple of others of his readers.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.100]   We went on a bike ride and then wound up visiting with him at his home and he very graciously
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.340]   invited us to spend the night.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.260]   So my wife and I spent the night in his basement back when he had a basement, saw his project
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.900]   when he was working on it.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.780]   And Pete, his wife and his son are just really great people.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.420]   He is genuine to the core.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.420]   I've met him and interacted with him a number of other times and I think if any of you met
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.920]   him, you would understand that he is who he says he is.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.100]   When he talks about doing his writing because he just wants to do it, he really does.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.620]   When he talks about not wanting to be part of the system, he really is.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.300]   He's a genuine guy.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.580]   And I love that about him.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.060]   I applaud that.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.140]   It's fantastic.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:55.680]   It's also important that you recognize that his style of writing and his humor tends toward
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.980]   self-deprecation.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:03.540]   And this is one of the challenges because you have to filter through the language of
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:10.740]   self-deprecating, humble language to try to understand is this really possible for a lot
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.740]   of people.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.020]   Now, if Pete were listening to this, he would say, "Of course it's possible for a lot of
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.020]   people.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.660]   What are you talking about?"
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:23.260]   The problem is you do need to have a significant – you need to have significant skills and
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.240]   competencies.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.740]   No matter how disarmingly casual his language is about his approach, he is an extremely
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.560]   hard and industrious worker.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.780]   There are a number of lessons that you can take even from his specific story that can
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.740]   be applied to many of our situations.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.940]   Here are just some lessons.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.900]   Number one, when he started off out of college, he didn't have any debt, no savings and he
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.620]   was very flexible.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.060]   He didn't own a lot of stuff and so he was able to go and put himself in different positions.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.060]   He worked hard.
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.500]   He got a degree in something that's actually useful.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.380]   He got a degree in computer engineering and it's much easier to get a high-paying job
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.980]   with a degree in computer engineering than with say a degree in the humanities.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.340]   He was a serious worker.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.620]   For example, if you read his story, he talks about how he skipped his university graduation
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.860]   ceremony and because he didn't want to miss any work, he had already moved away to a new
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.460]   city 300 miles away from the university.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.860]   So he skipped walking across the graduation ceremony.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.700]   So don't let the persona of, "Oh, I'm kind of a slacker," fool you.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.360]   The man works hard and he's a hard worker even now.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.580]   You can't be lazy and have this type of philosophy work.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.940]   Yes, he bought a car but it took him a year to pay off his car after he borrowed about
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.260]   $16,000 from it.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.500]   So he was focused from the very beginning.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:52.380]   He talks about how – disarmingly talks about, "I flaunted my new salary around town with
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:58.420]   bar and restaurant hopping and computer equipment and furniture and accessories for my car."
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:03.220]   But the reality is, yes, his level of flaunting was nothing like what the average person was.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.460]   He was working hard at paying off debt.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.720]   Certainly he got better over time but he was working hard at paying off debt.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:19.540]   In his first time in a year in the tech market, he increased his salary from $41,000 to $57,600.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.940]   That's a 40 percent raise.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:27.060]   They don't hand out 40 percent raises to people who A, aren't in a good industry.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.740]   He was in the computer engineering industry during a rising tech market.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.940]   B, they don't hand out 40 percent raises to people who are slackers.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.540]   So all of these things.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.300]   He moved to the United States to get a job.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.540]   That's one of the most important things, increasing his income.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.500]   He and his wife met early and they joined finances early.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.120]   That makes a huge difference to the ability to save wealth.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.700]   Being a two-income household where expenses are less because of the shared efficiency
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.620]   of expenses, this is a big, big deal.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:08.620]   To add her income to his income and have the ability to enjoy more frugal activities together,
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.740]   these things are a big, big deal in terms of actual results.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:18.780]   Eight years out of college, he was earning $125,000 a year and his wife was earning $70,000
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.780]   a year.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:26.740]   So that allowed them to significantly increase their savings very, very quickly.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:33.900]   I hope in that you see, and I'm trying to cut through the casual, catchy, self-deprecating
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.540]   humor to see that don't let that stuff fool you.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.980]   A lot of times people that are very smart will conceal that smartness behind an image
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.300]   that will help to not get such bad results.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.420]   In our society, for whatever reason, people tend to be – seem to be more jealous of
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.300]   people who are successful.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.620]   And so those of us who are successful, we often learn to engage in self-deprecating
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.940]   humor, kind of a "Ah, shucks, ma'am" type of attitude and Pete does exactly those
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.240]   same things.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.780]   If you follow those lessons, however, you can do what he's done.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.500]   The basic philosophy of financial independence that Pete espouses is a high savings rate.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:22.660]   Earn a lot of money and save a high percentage of it, ideally 50 to 75% or more of your income.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:28.500]   You can see how, based upon his own experience, that would be the simplest path to financial
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.660]   independence.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:35.820]   If he was earning $125,000 and his wife was earning $77,000, that's over $200,000.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.600]   Now ignore taxes for a moment.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:44.300]   If he were spending 25% of their income, they're living a $50,000 and saving $150,000.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.580]   Again, ignoring taxes temporarily.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.900]   They're saving – that would allow you to save 75% of your income.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:58.220]   And if you're spending $50,000 a year, you're living at what the median income is in the
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.220]   United States of America.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.840]   You can live a great life.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:07.160]   And when you bring that and add to that the lessons and skills of frugality that he embraces,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.700]   you can live a great life and you can become financially independent very quickly.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.200]   This is the approach that he is so powerful at articulating.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.880]   My experience, the people who most resonate with the philosophy of Mr. Money Mustache
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.260]   and his approach are those who are high-income earners who are just sick of what they're
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.340]   doing, sick of their job and wanting to do something different.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.060]   And for that person, his writing is addictive.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.300]   I've known so many people.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.740]   They start at the beginning and they read the entire volume of his blog.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.740]   And I did that one.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.220]   The first thing – generally, one of the things that I do when I find something is
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.500]   I read the whole archives, try to really understand.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:55.060]   So I've read every article he's ever written in the past but not recently.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.540]   I've read recent articles but in the past, I read all those things.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.860]   And so that helps you to grasp the knowledge.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.900]   And if you are a high-income earner, which most of you are, if you're a high-income
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:13.420]   earner, six-figure income earner and you're feeling stuck, you probably need a face punch
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:21.180]   from our friend, Mr. Money Mustache because Mr. Money Mustache has the ability to get
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:26.380]   you excited about living on $2,000 or $3,000 a month.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.300]   Really, really remarkable, his skill with that.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.860]   He is a skillful writer.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:40.460]   He brings a sense of – I'm failing for the word.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.700]   Insubordination, there's a better word for it.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.740]   Just the sense of like, yeah, we can figure it out on our own terms.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:52.820]   So he is a phenomenal writer to the upper class, to the high-income earners.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.780]   And that's his intended audience as best I can imagine.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.060]   He wants to help six-figure income earners recognize, "Listen.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.000]   You can do this."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.660]   This also shows the weakness of some of his philosophy because in many ways, if you're
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:18.940]   feeling stuck, you don't have a high income or you have other expenses.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.300]   Perhaps you're caring for your parents, aging parents, or perhaps you're caring for children
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.420]   and you have committed yourself to certain courses of action that make your decisions
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.420]   a little bit different.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:37.060]   People find it harder to really resonate with his message and with his methodology.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.900]   Not that you can't learn, and I'm going to go through some other things that he is consistently
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.900]   teaching.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   You can learn, but it won't resonate with you quite so much.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.140]   If you think back to the interviews I've played in recent days here on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:57.260]   many of the listeners are high income, no children, young working professionals.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:04.340]   It's no accident because this type of person can get extremely, a huge amount of value
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.700]   from him and from his philosophy.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.140]   Now, he's not exclusively limited to just save all your money.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:16.180]   He gives additional ways of doing it, much of which is a mindset.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:22.980]   One of the real strengths to the philosophy of mustachianism is bringing intelligent design
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.340]   to life.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:31.060]   Reid is an engineer, and so he brings that engineering skill set to the simple and the
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.900]   complex things of life.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:41.500]   Probably what he's most well known for is his, I want to say hatred, despisement.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:48.660]   He despises people who he would affectionately call car clowns, people who drive a lot.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.780]   If you think about his approach, this is very normal for an engineer.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.540]   An engineer looks at a problem and says, "How can we set something up for maximum efficiency?"
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.920]   Especially a computer engineer who needs to understand how to make the code the simplest
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.800]   possible so that it loads quickly and so that it works effectively.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.860]   What he looks at is the massive simplicity and effectiveness of your making a choice
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.460]   to live right next to your work.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.660]   That is so valuable.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.900]   Many people don't think about that, and that's applicable no matter whether you're a high
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.380]   income earner or whether you're a low income earner.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.340]   Live close to work and you'll save time.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:30.180]   There's a reason why for years, President Trump, before he was President Trump, his
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.820]   office and his house are in the same building.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.580]   Just go up and down the elevator, and still, I guess his office and his house are in the
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.620]   same building.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.900]   It is incredibly efficient.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.820]   I love having my office and my house in the same building.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.140]   It is really, really valuable.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.980]   Pete brings that philosophy of engineering to almost every aspect of life, and I think
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.060]   that's something that we all should take and model.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.060]   Test the assumptions.
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.580]   Look at the situation and say, "If I were starting with a fresh blank slate, how would
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.100]   I design this to make it better?
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.540]   What is my actual goal, the end that I have in mind, and how can I bring intelligent design
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.300]   to this particular concept?"
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   Another thing that Pete is really well – that I see as far as one of his fundamental strengths
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.860]   is he embraces adversity.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:26.300]   I would say that he is influenced although – he aligns well.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.780]   If you're familiar with the fundamentals of Stoic philosophy, the philosophy of Stoicism
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:39.980]   is gaining a real resurgence in the young – I think primarily men, young men really
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.860]   seem to be resonating with the philosophy of Stoicism.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:48.780]   Although I don't know how deeply Pete has delved into Stoicism as a philosophy, he models
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.140]   the values of it, the embracing of adversity.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:24:00.100]   He wrote a post years ago about his embrace of having his house be hot by not putting
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.020]   air conditioning in the house.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:07.500]   This is a really useful mindset to go out and tackle adversity and take it as something
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.500]   that's powerful.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.620]   When I was with him a few weeks ago, we got together over breakfast and he was talking
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:17.660]   about the cold shower that he had just taken, the place where we were together had run out
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.380]   of hot water and so they'd taken a freezing cold shower.
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.740]   But he wasn't complaining about it.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:29.060]   He had tackled it as a benefit about what a rush, what a wake up to have a freezing
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.700]   cold shower in the morning, I feel really good right now.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.780]   That's a tremendously powerful life skill.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.220]   You don't have to embrace Stoicism to embrace that.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.540]   I don't embrace Stoicism.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.620]   I reject the philosophy, not as not having some useful points but personal reasons for
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.620]   it.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.220]   But I want to embrace the same philosophy.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.620]   I really love that and I think that's so powerful to embrace adversity.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.340]   He writes about going out and riding his bicycle in a blizzard, in a snowstorm, all through
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:03.660]   the winter or of learning how to fit in small spaces, learning how to live in less.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:10.020]   All of these things, if you turn it into an adventure, it can change your experience of
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.460]   life.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.700]   That philosophy is applicable to everybody.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.220]   You don't have to be rich or poor.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:22.180]   Just embrace adversity and embrace it as an adventure because you can grow out of it.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.380]   Really really useful.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:34.380]   Again, he's big on being able to live big on little amounts of money by nixing stupid,
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.580]   by cutting out stupid stuff out of your life.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.900]   That's something that's applicable no matter who you are, rich, poor, high income, low
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.420]   income, no matter where you live or your situation.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:49.380]   You can do really well by living large on just a little bit of money.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.860]   Pay attention to the details.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.660]   His writing is a good mix of philosophy and practice.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:01.940]   He does a good job of writing an article that is very philosophical, talks about very motivational
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.220]   and then in the next article, here's how you install a shower or here's how you tackle
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:16.140]   your, here's how you save money on your cell phone plan, things like that.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.580]   Big on again dumping the car and embracing the bicycle.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.340]   It's valuable no matter whether you have a high income or low income and these things
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.720]   start to flow together.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:30.460]   You can see how his philosophy is so powerful because if you design your life intelligently
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:36.700]   by focusing on how close your house is to your office and you embrace adversity, that
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:42.680]   makes you more likely to be willing to ride your bike even if you get a little sweaty
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.340]   or a little cold.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.720]   All these things save you money.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   It's good engineering.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.140]   It's very, very efficient and it cuts out a significant expense by having extra cars
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:56.100]   or extra car costs out of your budget by just simply making some things different.
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.180]   Now this again is applicable whether you're rich or poor.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:04.460]   In my area, just like probably in your area, a lot of the poor people ride bicycles and
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:11.020]   what Pete is doing is by embracing adversity, teaching people to become rich by changing
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.660]   the perception that riding a bicycle is cool.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.420]   It's not just for poor people.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.860]   One of the real strengths of his philosophy is embracing do-it-yourself skills and doing
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:31.860]   this for multiple benefits by tackling home repair, by tackling car maintenance, by tackling
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.300]   learning new skills like web design.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:40.020]   You are able to save money but you're also able to become a more well-rounded person.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:46.560]   His basic investment scheme is simple, index funds and rental real estate.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.520]   He really doesn't ever delve – excuse me, also peer-to-peer lending.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.380]   He does some peer-to-peer lending projects.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:00.140]   Beyond that, he really doesn't dig into investing any more than that for good reason.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.300]   It works and it's simple.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.640]   More than anybody, I think he does a great job of really modeling the cumulative value
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.240]   of small steps.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:18.120]   He wrote an article called A Millionaire Has Made $10 at a Time which focuses on the power
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.660]   of little decisions.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:24.660]   I think it's so important to constantly remember little decisions, lots of little decisions
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:30.060]   add up to the long run.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:39.440]   So there is a lot that all of us can learn from his writing.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:48.400]   His writing – he's popular because of the power of his ideas and also even his style.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.240]   He's an interesting writer.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   He writes.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.880]   He's very colorful, writes with very colorful language.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.640]   He is a wordsmith.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.920]   He's very poetic, very skilled at bringing words together in a poetic way.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.040]   This really, really helps people to be able to engage with him.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.880]   He's also meeting a need at a particular moment in time.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   We've reached an age in which consumerism has become one of the major religions of our
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.200]   day.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:29.080]   Yet consumerism is leaving many millions of people without a sense of meaning.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:34.760]   So there are many people who are casting around saying, "Where do I find a sense of meaning?
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.040]   Where do I find meaning after consumerism?
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.880]   What do I do?"
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.260]   He writes to that audience and does a tremendous job of saying, "Look, there can be meaning
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.480]   after consumerism because you don't need it.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.820]   Financial independence is going to provide that meaning."
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:56.840]   This unique cultural moment, I think, is also very key in understanding the rise of his
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.920]   success as a writer and as a voice in the personal finance space.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.480]   What worked in the past doesn't really work now and doesn't seem to work now.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.080]   There are many people who are looking at their parents and recognizing, "My parents aren't
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.080]   happy.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:16.840]   This idea of working an entire lifetime and then quitting, it's really not working for
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   them."
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.280]   So the way out seems so simple.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.480]   If I become financially independent in short order, then I can do what I want to do.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.480]   And this is powerful.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.840]   So you put these things together and you put together his skill, the strength of his philosophy,
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:39.720]   and the skill as a writer, this unique cultural moment, and it helps me to understand his
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   success.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.280]   It really does.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.180]   Now, Pete and his writing are not without controversy and they're not without weakness.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.600]   Weakness is all in the eye of the beholder.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:56.480]   I think for his audience, his intended audience, which is six-figure income, working professionals,
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.560]   I don't know that he has a weakness, certainly, especially in two of my complaints, that perhaps
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.600]   the third one would be there.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:13.640]   But for my audience or for the general public, there are three major weaknesses that I think
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.680]   are found in his message.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.240]   Again, weaknesses, you have to be careful because the most skillful and effective of
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.400]   people are speaking to their tribe.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.940]   And Pete has created a powerful tribe, done it very, very powerfully, where his followers
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.680]   and fans will self-identify as Mustachians.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.920]   This is powerful language.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.280]   But so don't think that somebody's a failure just because they don't speak to all people.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.660]   The most powerful people don't speak to all people.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.320]   But here would be three things I want you to be aware of.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:55.560]   The biggest flaw in his philosophy and in his approach is if you don't fit that profile
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:01.660]   of high-income professional.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:11.100]   If you aren't earning six figures or if you're not at a stage of your life where it's appropriate
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:18.460]   for you to make significant pivots, it can be easy to find his writing frustrating.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:25.460]   Because of his extreme casual, "This is so great, everyone should do it," attitude, which
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:31.460]   is very motivating to those for whom it is appropriate, it can be very frustrating for
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:36.700]   you to read some of his advice, read some of his approaches.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:43.260]   Because if you're earning $50,000 a year, somebody telling you that it's easy, it can
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.260]   be frustrating.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.040]   Or even if you're earning more than that, but your expenses are higher due to reasons
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:53.940]   that aren't as simple as changing to a different cell phone, it can be very frustrating.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.320]   So you need to focus on increasing your income.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   That might not be easy.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.040]   You need to focus on recognizing that sometimes you're just at stages of life where you've
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:10.760]   made certain commitments that aren't worth giving up in order to get out.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:21.660]   It's okay to simply decide, "I'm not willing to give these things up in order to get out
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.700]   and be financially independent."
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.180]   So if you have a lower income, focus on your income.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.460]   You should learn from Mr. Money Mustache and others because lowering money on your cell
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.960]   phone plan is still valuable.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.280]   Building DIY skills is still valuable.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:43.760]   But look past the "easiness" of it and recognize that you have an income problem and an expense
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.560]   problem and you're going to need more than moving close to work to save you money.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.920]   Moving close to work is something you should probably do and you should probably think
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.500]   about, but you're going to need bigger benefits.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.640]   Another major weakness of his philosophy is just the investing ideas, simplicity of investing
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   ideas.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.760]   I think he misses a major area of potential return.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.860]   Again, not a problem.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.760]   If you're a high income earner, you probably shouldn't be dabbling in creative investment
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   ideas.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.980]   If you're a lawyer and you're earning $250,000 a year, your best use of your time is to figure
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.960]   out how to go from 250 to 450 and you shouldn't be figuring out how to make a higher rate
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.000]   of return here on the side.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.880]   But if the best use of your time is not in your income, there are alternative investment
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.480]   ideas that are worth your consideration.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.900]   So you probably should go and study and research your investment philosophy and try to see
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:50.400]   if there's another way that you can get higher returns from your personal approach to investing.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.920]   Buying index funds and mainstream traditional rental real estate are not the only ways to
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.600]   build wealth.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.620]   You can embrace entrepreneurship.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.000]   You can embrace inside investing.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.960]   There are all kinds of creative ways.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.640]   When your income is not so high and if you don't have significant prospects there with
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.080]   your job prospects, then you should consider other approaches.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:24.220]   Then third and finally, what I think is probably the biggest weakness, which should be obvious
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:28.680]   from the speech that I released on the show, the speech that I gave to the mustachionism,
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.960]   is simple.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.720]   What's the point of retiring?
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.040]   One thing I don't understand, I haven't asked him personally, at some point I will, but
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:44.260]   I don't understand what the point is of this aggressive pursuit of retirement.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.100]   It sounds good and I get it.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.240]   Maybe I'll get it more when I'm actually financially independent.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   I'm not financially independent.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.680]   I can't live on the dividends of my portfolio and so maybe I don't understand it.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:05.360]   But intellectually, I don't get why this retirement thing is a big deal.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.560]   Pete right now earns more money than he's ever earned in his life.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.640]   To his credit, he doesn't seem to spend a ton more.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.900]   He spends a little bit more, but he doesn't spend a ton more.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.880]   But he could do that whether he was retired or not retired.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.120]   You can have control over your schedule, over your life, over what you do, whether you have
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:32.000]   $800,000 in the bank in a paid off house or whether you have $100,000 in the bank and
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.960]   you have your own business.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:41.320]   So this obsession with financial independence, I don't understand and I don't understand
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.600]   the point of it.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.460]   What's the point of it?
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.400]   Is the point hedonism?
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:53.960]   I think this is a major philosophical weakness that his philosophy is that happiness is the
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.480]   only logical pursuit of life.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:01.440]   That's a loose quote of one of his essays, that the only point of life is to be happy.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   I don't ascribe to that for philosophical reasons, but what is it that makes you happy?
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.600]   That's a deeper question.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.000]   And I fear that the common tendency, I don't think this for Pete.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.420]   He has different – he's more thoughtful than that.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.000]   But for many people, the basic meaning of that is hedonism.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.240]   I want to sleep in or I want to just be able to do what I want.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.680]   Yeah, but what are you going to do?
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:35.040]   And my listening to people who've achieved financial independence confirms my fear that
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.520]   it's a hollow victory.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.080]   It can be a hollow victory.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.800]   So what's next?
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.840]   I feel this is probably the biggest weakness of the pursuit of financial independence.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:53.200]   But pursuing wealth and financial independence for its own sake, it's a poor master.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.320]   What's the point?
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.360]   There should be something beyond that.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:05.640]   The pursuit of financial independence as an expression of character, of stewardship, of
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.160]   self-discipline, I think that's good.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   But then what?
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   What are you going to do when you're financially independent?
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.000]   That to me is a major question.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.040]   There's this intense fixation.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.920]   I had Bill, a reader of Mr. Money Mustache who I met.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:29.680]   I had Bill – it was episode 416, Bill on the show and he was focusing and talked about
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.240]   how he retired at age 42.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.120]   One of the key hallmarks is he talked about how maybe he should have done it earlier and
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.440]   he recommended to other people they should have retired earlier.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.200]   Pete, Mr. Money Mustache has written various essays telling people, "You should retire
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   right now."
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.000]   I don't get it.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.080]   I don't get what the benefit of retiring is.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.480]   If somebody's – I don't get it.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.720]   I don't see work as an enemy.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.760]   This would be just a deep philosophical difference.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   Work is good.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.760]   Work is helpful.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.120]   Work is important.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.800]   So I don't view work as the enemy.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.360]   Now again, I want to be very clear.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.840]   I build that on a philosophy of – a biblical philosophy.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.680]   That's how I seek to have my philosophy formed and the Bible teaches that work is
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.680]   good.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.480]   Man is built for work, built for service, and is seeking to build for something that
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.760]   goes beyond his own lifetime.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.240]   So in that context, that would be the biggest difference.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:30.440]   Now you don't have to buy into that if you don't want to, but to me I think this is
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.920]   one of the major weaknesses of retirement.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.360]   Been saying that for three years since I've been doing this show and I haven't – I
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.080]   still haven't seen any evidence that would convince me to change my mind.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.840]   That is my analysis of the philosophy of Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.040]   I would encourage you to learn from him.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.520]   He is a powerful writer.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.600]   He's just a tremendous wordsmith.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.040]   He's a poet.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   That's his best skill set.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.760]   He's very unassuming in person.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.640]   I would encourage you even just the lesson, Pete is a brilliant writer.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.440]   He struggles to communicate verbally.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.040]   He said that publicly and so I'm not criticizing him.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.960]   He struggles to communicate verbally in the sense of being able to speak clearly, speak
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.840]   publicly.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.480]   Play to your strength.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:25.520]   His strength as an introverted thinker is in writing.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.160]   And so for you, you should learn from his example of what he does and how he's built
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   it.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.520]   Learn from his skill with words to build a tribe and a community around a central idea.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:42.440]   He's built a cult, a leaderless cult as he says, a cult of ideas and it's powerfully
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.520]   influential.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.560]   Learn from that.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:53.340]   Learn from his experience and learn from – don't let again the unassuming nature turn you off.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.680]   Learn from what he actually did right.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:59.880]   He's a very smart man and his path has been intentional and designed.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.380]   Some of the things have been things that I haven't even heard him mention.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.160]   But you can't get away from hard work.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.800]   Worked very, very hard.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.120]   So learn from those things and then think how you can apply those techniques to your
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.420]   own life.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:20.200]   On his blog, there are gems for all of you, all of us.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:27.240]   Don't let the things that might be frustrating to you, don't let those dissuade you.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.600]   Life is all about going places, picking out the good and spitting out the bones.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.520]   I hope that you make that a constant habit.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:41.080]   So Pete's blog is MrMoneyMustache.com.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.560]   Hopefully you have a better introduction to the philosophy.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.040]   It is certainly influential here in Radical Personal Finance because I seek to serve among
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.040]   others.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.400]   I seek to serve the early retirement financial independence community or the so-called FIRE
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.640]   community, financial independent retire early community.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   So I seek to serve that.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.560]   So you got to pay attention to the philosophy.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.120]   Hey, that's right.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.760]   If you save 75% of your income, seven and a half years you'll be financially independent.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.080]   So if you make 200 grand, live on 50 and in seven and a half years you'll be financially
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   independent.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.080]   We'll see.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.360]   You can tune in to Radical Personal Finance in the coming decade and we'll see if I change
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.400]   my mind on retirement.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.120]   I don't expect to because I don't expect to ever retire and don't expect to ever quit.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.760]   But you never know.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.280]   Life has a way of teaching us new things.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   At least that's been my experience.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.240]   Thank you so much for listening to the show today.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:36.000]   As we go, I want to remind you, please, if you haven't done so already, please take a
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.640]   moment and record a quick three minute, two to three minute story on your phone and send
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.000]   me the file.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.460]   Record just what Radical Personal Finance has meant to you, how it has helped you and
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:53.160]   what you've done with the advice and insight and education encouragement you've received
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   on the show.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.680]   I want to hear your stories, want to profile that for episode 500 of the show so that the
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.120]   audience can hear more of the stories.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:07.760]   As you're emailing that to me at Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, as you're emailing me that audio file, Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.680]   email me also a picture of you and your family, please.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.720]   Just for me personally, I'm going to put these up as a screensaver on my computer to let
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.560]   me know who I'm talking to every day.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.720]   That's so helpful.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.720]   Email that to me as well.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.640]   And finally, as we go, I want to thank the patrons of the show.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:31.600]   There are 260 individual patrons of the show who send me, put together $1,625 per month.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.680]   Receive some other income from my personal consulting services, from advertisers, et
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   cetera.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.240]   But this is so important to me to have Radical Personal Finance be reflective of you, the
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   community.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:50.680]   So if you'd like to support the work here and add to that 260, please come to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron and show your support for the show.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.280]   Thank you.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   Thank you.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   Bye-bye.
