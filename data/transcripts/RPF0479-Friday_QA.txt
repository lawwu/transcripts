[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.080]   Live from sunny South Florida, it's Q&A Friday.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.400]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.960]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.080]   Today is Friday and to the best of my ability, we do Q&A shows on Friday.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.600]   We've got a live phone conference, callers, listeners calling in with their questions
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.120]   and we'll go there in just a moment and see if we can provide some useful insight and
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.800]   wisdom.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.200]   I enjoy doing these shows.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.400]   It's more like kind of a live call-in financial Q&A radio.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.080]   I enjoy doing them and I know you as the audience enjoy them.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.840]   It allows us to deal with some more practical topics than all the topics that I list every
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   week.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840]   I need that.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.280]   I need you guys to ask specific questions from me in order to cover these practical
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.800]   topics because often I spend so much time thinking about weird theoretical, ideological
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.760]   stuff, etc. that I really need you guys' insight and questions.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.360]   So today, it's going to be fun and we're going to get to some practical topics.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.120]   Real quick, if you would like to join and have access to a call like this, come on by
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.280]   and sign up to become a patron of the show at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.880]   Patrons always receive priority and receive access to these calls.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.800]   From time to time, if I don't get enough insight or enough calls from patrons of the
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   show, then I'll put out another message somewhere else.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.440]   So for example, this morning I put out a quick email to the email list and that's where
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.960]   a couple of callers today are joining us in from as well.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.400]   So make sure that if you have the financial means and you want to send a buck or two or
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.100]   ten my way per month because you value Radical Personal Finance, I appreciate that.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.200]   You can do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.520]   In addition to that, you can always come on by and make sure you join the email list.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   That doesn't cost you anything.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.040]   Or join the Facebook group, the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.840]   I use both of those groups for notification sometimes.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.880]   I have to do it at the moment.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.760]   I'm choosing to limit the access to these calls just so I can do enough of them.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   I probably at this point could do a daily Q&A show and just open it up to the whole
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   audience.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   Who knows?
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   Maybe I'll do that at some point.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   But right now that's not my plan.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880]   Go first to Mark in Washington State.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.280]   Mark, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.280]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.920]   Go ahead with your question, please.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.760]   So my wife and I, a bit of background, we've been following the Dave Ramsey plan and we're
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.000]   unsure of what we need to be doing in our next step since we are looking to be moving
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.800]   internationally, moving back to my wife's country.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.560]   There's a lot I could say on this, but the basic point is we've concluded the political
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.380]   situation is such that we would not want to buy a home there.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.380]   We could, as foreigners, be kicked out with 24-hours notice.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.040]   And so we don't want to have any assets tied up in something like that.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.400]   And so we're trying to figure out what we should be doing in terms of housing given
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   that.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.560]   And so we've thought up of three kind of options and would love your thoughts as to what we
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   should do.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.120]   The first would be to buy a home in the U.S., find a good rental agency company that could
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.880]   overlook that and manage it for us, hopefully near families so they could occasionally go
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.320]   in, take a look, make sure it's okay.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.960]   The second would be to invest the equivalent of our down payment in maybe a no-load, low-turnover
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.440]   S&P 500 index fund so you can get the growth on that without paying constant taxes from
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.000]   the sales and turnover.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.920]   The third option would be to just invest more in retirement savings since we are hoping
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.880]   to live overseas for life.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.800]   The risk of being kicked out is rather low, but it is still there.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.240]   And so we're just trying to figure out what we should be doing to prepare to own a home,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.000]   though we don't think we can own one in the country we'll be living in for the foreseeable
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   future.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.360]   Well, I'm not Dave Ramsey, but since you mentioned his name, I'd be happy to be a co-laborer
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.760]   with him and coach you a la Dave Ramsey's plans.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.520]   Which baby step are you in of Dave Ramsey's baby steps?
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.240]   We are in four, five, and six.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.480]   We've been doing 15%.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   That's four.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.320]   We have roughly $500 a month extra on top of that.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.120]   We have $4,200 in each of our two children's ESA health savings accounts.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.000]   They are ages two and a half and one.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.480]   And then we obviously don't have a six because that's paying off the house.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.320]   And we skipped the, if you're familiar, we skipped the 3B because we thought we would
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.680]   not be able to buy the home living internationally.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.600]   And we've since taken a second step back and say, well, maybe we ought to be looking at
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   buying a home domestically.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.200]   And so for the last couple of months, we paused our retirement savings to just build up that
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.920]   fund a little bit more in case we did choose to buy a home.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.120]   But we can throw those back in obviously if we decide to not purchase a home.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.640]   At this point, you and your wife are completely debt-free.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.160]   How much money do you have all told, including retirement accounts just all across the board?
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   How much money do you have?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.240]   So everything, if I include our emergency fund savings and Roth, it is, let me do some
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.920]   quick math, sorry, about $52,000.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.280]   And when you are abroad, will you be earning a high income?
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.240]   We will be earning the equivalent of about $60,000 US.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.480]   That goes a lot further in the country we're living in than it would be in the US.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.680]   So we have some, I forget the word for that, but the cost of living will be lower.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   Arbitrage, there we go.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   Thank you.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   Geographic arbitrage.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.400]   How long do you expect to be abroad?
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.680]   We're thinking 25 to 30 years.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.840]   So this is, you're planning to raise your children abroad, be established there, establish
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.560]   your careers abroad, and then possibly return to the United States during retirement year
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.720]   or something like that.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   Correct.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   Correct.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.880]   I think that the plan would be to retire here, most likely, with the caveat that there is
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.520]   the risk that we might need to leave given the political climate.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.360]   But I think that risk is relatively low, but high enough I wouldn't want to have significant
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.880]   assets tied up that we couldn't be able to get out.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.760]   And will you maintain US citizenship and/or apply for dual citizenship in your country
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   of residence?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.640]   US citizenship will be maintained, and we are not able to do dual citizenship in that
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   country.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   Interesting.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:14.960]   Have you ever owned real estate either personally to live in and/or as a rental opportunity?
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   No.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.440]   So let's start with that.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.880]   I would not, if I woke up in your shoes, I would not pursue real estate.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.240]   I don't see any reason to pursue real estate, at least not personal ownership.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.680]   If you had some experience in it, that would be a reasonable thing.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.680]   Or if you were going to be abroad for a short amount of time, that would be a reasonable
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680]   thing.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.720]   But 25 to 30 years, I don't see any benefit for you in engaging in real estate.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.960]   Here's why I say that.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   Real estate is an asset class.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.000]   Just speaking broadly, real estate is an asset class I'm convinced will only ever increase
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.280]   as wages increase or decrease.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.960]   Real estate is a commodity.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.020]   And so it has a specific connection to people's wages.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:12.760]   So thus it'll basically in the aggregate only ever grow at the rate of inflation of wages.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.240]   In time, real estate becomes worth less and less because the houseware is out.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.540]   The land maintains some value, but the houseware is out.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.280]   And so when you have a long time perspective, 30 years, if you bought a brand new house
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.480]   today and you move forward 30 years, your house is not going to be as valuable on a
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.400]   dollar adjusted basis 30 years from now as it is today.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.020]   It's a 30-year-old house.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.560]   Now the land may have changed and the underlying community may have changed, but on the whole,
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:48.120]   real estate is going to be a very steady asset class that will keep pace with wages.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.540]   The ways in which real estate investors make their money are a fewfold.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.840]   The most common ways is number one, to find an inefficient market, a mispriced house,
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.200]   something that is a deal because somebody's grandmother died and they got to dispose of
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.640]   the house and they want to sell quickly and they don't want to shine it up and fix it
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.200]   up and sell it there.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.520]   So that's one way.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   Another way is by finding a neighborhood or a particular market that's on a growth trajectory.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.800]   This town is growing, the business climate is growing, et cetera.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   That's another way.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.320]   Or what most real estate investors do is their basic benefit of real estate is they can borrow
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.340]   money for a house and have a tenant pay it off for them.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.680]   But it always involves some amount of work.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.160]   When you start adding management costs in, it lowers your profit margin.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.320]   If you're abroad, you're not going to be able to keep a good finger on the pulse of what's
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.840]   happening locally.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.720]   When I start adding all those things together, given the fact that you have no history and
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   no experience, I would not pursue real estate.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.920]   I don't see any benefit whatsoever in that direction.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.960]   Now the question is, what do you do?
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   Well, at first, I would do nothing except just get myself established in the new country.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.640]   If you've got, just speaking broadly, 50 grand, 50 grand can be eaten up pretty quickly in
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   all kinds of things.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.880]   Now we don't need to get into details of moving packages, who's moving you there, who's paying
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.760]   expenses, who's establishing you, et cetera.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.760]   But if I woke up and had 50 grand and two young children and I was now we're moving
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.100]   abroad, I would just keep everything in cash until I made the transition, until I got settled.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:26.220]   You might find out a year or two years from now that what looks awesome is not.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.000]   You might hate it, your wife might hate it, and you say, "That's it.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.680]   We're going back to the United States."
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.360]   You might find out that you love it and that it's wonderful, and you might start seeing
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.600]   opportunities.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.920]   So I personally, if I were in your shoes, I would be very slow to do anything right
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.720]   now.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.040]   Should you invest in stocks?
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.120]   Well, you already own some stocks.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.440]   So certainly, you might just keep what you have.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.480]   They're long-term investments, and so you might just keep what you have.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.320]   Would it work well for you to simply invest money into a broad-based index fund?
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   Sure.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.400]   That's an easy and efficient investment.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.040]   It'll probably be great.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.240]   You can buy good companies very inexpensively in the U.S. stock market by purchasing a broad-based,
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.440]   as you said, an index fund.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.600]   You can have an investment manager who's managing the fund for you, doing so very inexpensively
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.320]   in today's investment world.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.440]   You can have great company managers, your boards of directors of all the many thousands
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.520]   of companies that you own and their executive teams, and they're constantly out searching
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.400]   the world for investments.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.200]   So I would be entirely comfortable, if I woke up in your shoes, putting all of my investment
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.320]   dollars into a broad-based index fund.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   You can do it with an S&P 500.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   You can just buy a total market U.S. index fund and move abroad.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.120]   Chances are you come back in 30 years, you'll have tons of money in there, and there's nothing
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.120]   to worry about.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.520]   I would be comfortable with that.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.800]   I would be slow to make that my entire goal.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.640]   I would be open to opportunities I came across in the country of residence.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.480]   Certainly if there is political instability, that is important.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   That is a concern.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   You always need to make sure you have a backup plan.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.400]   Are you there in a governmental capacity where you have the support of the U.S. government?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   No.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   Okay.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.080]   So you need to just make sure if it's that unstable of a region, you need to make sure
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.480]   you have a plan to get out of the country.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.600]   If that means you need to keep a Jeep near the border so you can get across the border,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.960]   if that means you need to have plane tickets and whatnot, make sure that you have wealth
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.840]   that's not in the United States but that's in a neighboring country, something like that.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.960]   Just make sure you have backup plans.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.820]   If you're in a region of the world that's that unstable, you need to think very carefully
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.320]   about your backup plans.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.480]   I guess on the whole, I would move slowly, and I would wait to see until I got established
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   in a local area what my opportunities were.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.000]   I don't see a compelling value proposition to trying to take all of the cash that I've
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.760]   saved and move it directly, immediately into the market at today's valuations.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.080]   That's especially magnified because of the uncertainty of the coming days in your own
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.080]   schedule.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.480]   So I would probably just leave everything in cash for the next couple of years, move
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   abroad.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   In the meantime, we may have a recession.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.000]   There may be a dip in market prices.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.720]   You can always buy in to another market fund.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.320]   If you're investing in index funds, that means that you basically buy the premise that the
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.240]   market is pretty efficient.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.480]   And so basically, you can buy in at any point in time.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.460]   And when you've got a 20- or 30-year time horizon, you're not going to miss out because
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.520]   you keep the money sitting in a bank account for a year or two until you get established
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.320]   abroad and then go ahead and buy in.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.920]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.960]   Would you recommend to continue?
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.600]   We've been doing the 15% into tax advantage Roth IRA accounts.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.560]   Would you recommend to still do that 15% there?
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.200]   Or would you put pause on that as well until we know for sure we wouldn't be using that
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.400]   cash in a different capacity?
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.680]   Yeah, I wouldn't.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.940]   And I would – I mean, personally, if I woke up in your shoes, I would not bother with
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:08.000]   any of the U.S.-based retirement accounts and things at this point in time.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.420]   And here's why.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.620]   As someone who's living abroad, now you're going to keep your U.S. citizenship.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.880]   And so the U.S. government will continue to believe that they're entitled to your income
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.800]   even though you will be living abroad and working abroad.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.400]   The U.S. government out of all the governments in the world is the most tyrannical in the
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.360]   world when it comes to their claim on you.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.560]   And by the way, I would seriously investigate other options depending on the place that
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   you're going.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.760]   And that sounds like it would be in a politically unstable place.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.480]   I want that blue passport.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.440]   But if I were of the mental mind that I was happy to move abroad, I do think – you don't
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.640]   have enough money where this is going to matter at this point.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.960]   But I do think it's always important for people who are wealthier to consider renouncing
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.800]   U.S. citizenship and count the cost.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.680]   There are some benefits but there are a lot of costs.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.440]   And the big one is that the U.S. government thinks that they're entitled to all of your
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.120]   income that you earn in another country, that you spend in another country just because
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.740]   you have a blue passport.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.000]   That said, there is the earned income foreign exclusion.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.920]   And as long as you're out of the country, I believe it's 330 days, something around
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.320]   that, somewhere between 300 and 330 days, then up to a certain amount which is in excess
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.680]   of six figures, the U.S. government will not tax you on that money as long as you're out
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.160]   of the country for the appropriate amount of time.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.920]   So you will be able to avoid the U.S. income tax.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.260]   Well, if you're avoiding the U.S. income tax, then why should you worry about putting
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:43.000]   money into an account that's going to save you taxes on the income tax that you're not
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.840]   paying?
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.880]   Perhaps something – and I don't know the rules on this.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   It's kind of specialized.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.400]   I've always meant to think this through myself.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.620]   But since I haven't decided to move abroad, I haven't detailed it.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:58.440]   But you might – there might be benefit of putting money in a Roth IRA because you're
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.640]   not being taxed on the money anyway and maybe it would be sheltered.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.440]   The U.S. is certainly a very stable economy.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.760]   But I don't get all that excited about keeping money in the U.S. system with the exception
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.400]   of the stability.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.560]   And as an expatriate, I think there will be opportunities that will be available to you
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.240]   that aren't available to people who are full-time in the U.S.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.840]   Are you going to be in Asia or – in Asia, what region of the world are you going to
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   be in?
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.640]   Aaron Ross Powell: We'll be in the Asian regions.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:32.240]   Trevor Burrus: So if I were in the Asian region, I would establish some accounts in Singapore.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.960]   If I were in Singapore or Hong Kong, I would establish some accounts there and I would
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.280]   participate in those markets as well and I would at least keep some of my assets in Hong
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:47.720]   Kong or Singapore as being outside of U.S. jurisdiction but still in a very stable financial
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.000]   center.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.880]   And there will be things that will open up to you as well.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.720]   Don't be scared to invest where you know the opportunity.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.200]   For example, I'm going to make up a country.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.080]   Let's say that you're – you're living in a country that's very volatile but you're
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.200]   going to – nearby and you say, "All right here in Cambodia, I see some opportunities."
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.520]   There are often lots of opportunities at which you can apply capital and if you know the
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   opportunity and if you can build the network and you understand the culture, there are
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.720]   huge business and investment opportunities for somebody like you in many of these regions
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   of the world.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.520]   Where in the United States, having $30,000 doesn't do much for you, you can move in
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.840]   and you can invest in an apartment complex.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.280]   You can purchase a couple of apartments.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.880]   There are all kinds of things that open up to you as an investor with $30,000 of capital
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.440]   in some of the South Asian markets.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.040]   And many of these markets are very stable, very powerful and have a lot of opportunity
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   in them.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.200]   So I wouldn't jump on that today.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.440]   It's going to take time to get your feet under you, get your family moved.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.840]   But that's the point is look for opportunities that are there and especially if you're going
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.560]   to be in Asia, set up bank accounts in Hong Kong or Singapore, set up some assets there
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.920]   and use that as your banking center.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.360]   Investigate the five flags theories from the world of offshoring.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   Investigate some of the opportunities.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.520]   There are a bunch of big brands that do good business and maybe subscribe to a couple of
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.040]   the newsletters that'll point you in the direction of some of that if you haven't researched
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   that.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040]   That's helpful.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   That's helpful.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   Thank you.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   Great.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.400]   I wish you guys all the best.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.600]   You'll have an adventure no matter what and recognize, just give yourself an option.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.080]   A lot of times people find out that what they thought was going to be awesome isn't quite
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.640]   so awesome as they wanted.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.920]   So don't paint yourself into a corner.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.920]   Give it some time to make sure it works out.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.240]   John in Pennsylvania, welcome to the show, sir.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.800]   Hi, thanks, Joshua.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.280]   How can I serve you today?
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.440]   I have a question.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.960]   I think it's a pretty simple math question just to do an Excel spreadsheet, but I guess
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.880]   there's some other surrounding questions about it that I had.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.800]   It's about a pension from an old company that I used to work for.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:03.840]   They're offering a payout for a one or two month period window.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   It was a pension.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.480]   It's a big global company.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.120]   You may or may not be around when I'm 65.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.200]   I'm 38 now.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:20.600]   It is money that I kind of knew was there in pension form, but I wasn't really deeply
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.200]   highly counting on.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:30.920]   They're offering a lump sum payout versus a monthly payout that I can take now until
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   I die.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:39.800]   It seems to be that the lump sum payment is about 21 years worth of the monthly payment
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   if I take it now.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.840]   So if I live more than 21 years, I would, I guess, dollar-wise get more money, but of
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.880]   course that doesn't factor in inflation and all that stuff.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.840]   I guess that's kind of what I'm trying to figure out.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:57.080]   I can do the Excel spreadsheet to tell me when these two payouts equal each other, but
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:05.880]   I'm not really sure how to account for inflation just eating up the value of those dollars.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.440]   My tendency is just to say I should probably take the lump sum or wait until traditional
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.000]   retirement and take the normal payout at that time.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.200]   Are either of the amounts, the lump sum payout or the monthly income, are either of them
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.080]   substantial in your current financial picture?
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   Not at all.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.720]   I mean, nothing to say that it'd be a nice chunk to have, but I'm also not sure the tax
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.480]   implications of taking the lump sum.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:43.040]   It's about $23,500 for the lump sum and the monthly payout would be $91.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   And then there's like a 50% joint annuity survivor benefit.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.720]   So it goes down if I die from my survivor.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.160]   It's like $88 and $87 after that.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.120]   Are you required to make a decision?
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.140]   They're either going to send you a lump sum or they're going to start paying or can you
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.400]   defer the decision?
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.360]   Yeah, the third decision is do nothing.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.320]   They may or may not offer this again in the future.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.960]   That's one thing that this opportunity could come up next year or 10 years from now or
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   whatever.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:20.080]   Or if I do nothing, it's just I get the normal pension payout if the pension fund is still
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.320]   existing when I'm 65.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.200]   Why do you think they're making this offer?
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.360]   Why do you think they're trying to buy you out?
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.000]   The company, a lot of my friends still work there.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.160]   It's a big global company, but certain divisions are not doing excellent right now.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.320]   I imagine it's probably a little bit of bookkeeping or trying to save costs on administrative
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.160]   costs of how many people they have in the pension is my guess.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.640]   I don't think the huge company would completely go away.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.840]   It's been doing poor for about two or three years, but I don't think it'll necessarily
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.160]   go under or anything like that.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.280]   But the pension fund may be mismanaged or something like that.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.400]   But I think it's just cost savings for how many people they have in the fund itself maybe.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.440]   Well, there's always a risk.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.440]   Don't worry.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.920]   I mean, unless you're aware of something specific or unless you're aware that this particular
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.560]   pension fund is significantly underfunded, there are always risks.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.800]   There are always risks in investing.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.120]   Anybody can bail and they can stop paying you any time on anything.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.200]   So you've got to be aware of the fact that those risks always exist.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.920]   Your question is basically a mathematical one.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.680]   And so what I would do is I would go back and say, what's the alternative use of the
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.960]   dollar?
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:39.760]   If I, for example, if you are just going to say, I'm going to put the money into stocks.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.980]   Well, if you have a lot of stocks already, then maybe this doesn't help you that much.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.880]   Maybe it's not that much of a deal.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.420]   If the pension is you think it's poorly invested and it's underperforming, then maybe making
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.600]   that move would be useful, putting it into stocks.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.720]   But if it's not going to make a big difference, then you might just consider it as a useful
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.680]   asset and wait until you have a better opportunity.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.440]   A lot of times a pension is, especially if they're trying to buy you out, you need to
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.020]   investigate it carefully, mathematically and see, did they put themselves on the hook for
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.840]   too much of an obligation?
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.760]   Often a pension, they're wanting to get rid of it because it's too expensive.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.560]   I mean, the major trend for companies has been to eliminate guaranteed defined benefit
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:28.440]   pensions in favor of defined contribution plans, such as 401k plans, because they're
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.340]   less risk for the company.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.960]   So you want to look.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.160]   Sometimes you got a sweetheart deal.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.200]   There are oftentimes where there are things that are mispriced.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:42.760]   Sometimes annuity contracts are mispriced from insurance companies and they offer people
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   buyouts.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.320]   So I'm always very suspicious when I start getting letters from somebody saying, "Hey,
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   would you want this lump sum of money?"
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.900]   Because they might be doing that because they mispriced something and they actually have
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:24:00.640]   made a guarantee that's much more valuable than they would otherwise be.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.920]   The way that you do need to do the spreadsheet, sit down, and it's not just the break even.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.120]   That's not the...
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.400]   The break even analysis doesn't tell you anything.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.960]   It doesn't help you to say, "Well, 21 years, I'll get all the rest of this payout."
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.520]   That doesn't tell you anything unless you've got some usefulness for it.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.680]   What you need to do is you need to do a present value calculation.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:27.760]   And because this is a lifetime payment, the simplest way for you to do this is to call
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.160]   an insurance agent and ask them, "How much...
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:39.040]   If I wanted to buy an annuity payout today from a commercial, a highly rated, A-rated
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.400]   commercial insurance company, if I wanted to buy a straight lifetime annuity," line
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.900]   up the numbers with what they're offering.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.680]   If they're offering you a 50% joint and survivor, then said, "I'd like you to calculate for
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.760]   me a 50% joint and survivor annuity payout.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.520]   How much would I need to give you in order to buy a $91 monthly income?"
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.600]   Is $91 flat or is there an inflation adjustment on the amount?
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.400]   Michael O'Hara I think it's flat, but I'd have to read the
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   fine print here.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   I think it's flat.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   Tedd Johnson Okay.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.640]   So you just ask them, "How much money would I need to give to you to buy a $91 a month
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.760]   flat payout for the rest of my life with a 50% survivor benefit?"
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.840]   And they'll give you a number.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:25.480]   Now if that number is higher or lower, then you can start to understand the relative benefits
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.800]   of it.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:32.480]   I wouldn't jump to start incurring income from them unless you had some use for it.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.320]   An extra $91 a month is probably not that big a deal.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.840]   I would probably either leave it or take the lump sum and do something else.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.280]   But that's the simplest way for you to do.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.680]   Call an insurance agent, get a quote on a commercial annuity, and compare it that way
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.160]   to try to find out what the present value is.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.300]   And then just read the paperwork carefully.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   Is it inflation-adjusted?
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.720]   If so, maybe that's very valuable to you.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.840]   And how do the themes work?
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.160]   That's the extent that I would be able to answer it without reading all the paperwork.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.060]   But I think if you do that, if you call an insurance agent, get a quote on a commercial
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.960]   annuity and read the paperwork, you'll have a little more information to make a better
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   decision.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   Fair enough?
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   Michael O'Hara Thank you.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   I appreciate that.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   That's very helpful.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.160]   I think my instinct was always to not take deals when they're offered like this because
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.560]   of exactly what you said.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.680]   But my instinct is also the easy way, and I don't have to do any work to do that.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.360]   So I wanted to make sure I wasn't just jumping to the easy path.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.200]   But I will call the insurance agent since I have insurance with a guy, and he can probably
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   run those numbers for me.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   So thank you very much.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   Preston Pysh (00:36:40): Yeah.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.480]   Any insurance agent that works in the areas of life insurance, anybody that does that,
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480]   it's just simple.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.800]   They're just going to pull up the software on their computer.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   They can run that.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   It's about a 10-minute job.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.000]   And that'll be the simplest way to get some starting assessment.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   All right.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.840]   Bruce in Massachusetts, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   How can I serve you today?
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.000]   Bruce D. Lawrence (00:37:10): Hi, Joshua.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.360]   Thank you so much for taking my call today.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.360]   Really enjoy your show.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.200]   Love the advice you always give.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.440]   It's always kind of practical and well thought out.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.920]   I was calling because I read all the different financial bloggers and things like that, and
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.840]   I definitely have a plan that I'd like to be financially independent in 10 years.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.800]   But in addition to that, I certainly want to make sure the more important goal is I
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.160]   take care of my family.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.560]   And I recently just got married, sold my house, and just trying to figure out kind of what
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   the next steps are.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.800]   I've never rented before, but that's our plan for the next year, kind of assess where we
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   want to go from there.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.840]   I live in the Boston area.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.480]   The cost of housing here is quite expensive.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:51.280]   So I'd love to hear your thoughts on just kind of the pros and cons of having a family
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.360]   and renting versus owning.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.180]   I think financially it makes more sense to rent, but I feel like I might be missing out
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.280]   on other things.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.040]   So I know you always have good questions and thoughts for your guests to keep in mind when
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.080]   they're making decisions like that.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.160]   Congratulations on your nuptials.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.600]   How recently were you married?
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.740]   A couple months ago.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.480]   My wife is from India.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.640]   She's amazing, and it's really exciting to be entering this phase in our lives.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:25.760]   And we certainly plan on looking into having kids, blessed and fortunate enough to do that.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:33.280]   So kind of just big picture advice, then let's talk some specifics.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.000]   And to clarify, you sold your house.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   So at the moment you are renting and neither you nor your wife own any real estate at the
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   moment?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.920]   I have property in another state with my father.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   We built a house from – we just bought land and built a house from the ground up.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.440]   So that's like an additional property.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.920]   It's owned free and clear, so I just have to pay a little bit of maintenance and taxes.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.400]   My dad helps me with all that stuff.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   Great.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:08.220]   So to begin with, I think it's always important to start with the human factor and not the
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.800]   financial factor.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:16.360]   We don't want to serve the idol of finances or we don't want to be slaves to money.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.180]   The money is our slave.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:24.560]   And so everything we do with money needs to fit us, not the other way around.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.640]   So it's never a good idea to do something just because it's a wise financial thing.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.540]   We always want to start with what's right for us and then figure out the wisest way
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.820]   to handle the money given the constraints.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.100]   If I were newly married, I don't look around and say, "What's the cheapest place that
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.700]   I can find?" and then move into it.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.460]   I start with saying, "What's an appropriate thing for us to do, an appropriate way for
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.460]   us to live?"
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.460]   I think at the beginning of a marriage, for many people, I would recommend what you've
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:04.460]   done to start off with renting together and eliminate the hassle of home ownership and
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.960]   enjoy the phase of newlyweds.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:15.500]   There is just a simple proverb or an aphorism that I love, which is during the initial stage
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:21.260]   of marriage, just simply focus on learning your wife or if a woman is listening, learning
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.700]   your husband.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:28.740]   Focus on learning your spouse and focus on enjoying that time together.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.660]   In the Mosaic Law in the Old Testament and the Christian Bible, there was a law that
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:38.260]   says when a man is newly married, he is not permitted to be sent off to war.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:43.460]   He must be given a year to stay at home and learn how to please his wife.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.100]   So conceptually, I like that as a basic fundamental principle.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.700]   When I was married, I sought to withdraw from every community organization I had previously
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.700]   been involved in.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:31:01.780]   I sought to withdraw from every entangling connection or commitment that I could disentangle
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.300]   myself from.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.020]   Part of that includes real estate.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:11.100]   I don't think you should immediately, after being very recently married, say, "Let's run
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.060]   out and start house hunting."
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.180]   Because when you're newly married, you hardly know each other's language.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.100]   You hardly know each other's goals.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.700]   You hardly know each other's dreams.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.220]   You hardly know what you want or what you need.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:30.220]   Time has a tremendous benefit of helping those things be established to help to understand
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.380]   what your wife's preferences are, what her style is, what are the things that are important
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.260]   to her, for you to talk all those things through.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.660]   And there is no substitute for time.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:45.460]   So on the basis of that principle, I would encourage you to move very slowly and to focus
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.860]   on rent, just rent.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.100]   I don't even mind paying more.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.660]   I'm not worried about making finances number one.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.960]   My wife is more important than my money.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.500]   And so we focus on my wife first.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:04.100]   We focus on building a solid, establishing our marriage first together before we worry
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.500]   about money.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.020]   There's no reason to be wasteful.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.820]   So I'm not saying that in order to establish a marriage, you've got to go and spend massive
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.300]   amounts of money that you don't have.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   That's not the principle.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.500]   The principle is just focus on the relationship.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:24.020]   The phase of life of being newlyweds is a unique phase.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:29.380]   It is a blessing to be together, to be able to enjoy that relationship.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:35.540]   And it's a really fun phase, especially even before children arrive.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.020]   There's a phase at which when you can enjoy being husband and wife, when you can enjoy
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:45.220]   the freedom, the companionship, all of the blessings that come with being able to be
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:50.820]   together, to live together, to travel together, all of those things that you couldn't do before
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:56.860]   you were married, you now have that opportunity and you have the freedom and flexibility of
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.260]   not yet caring for children.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.340]   And so I would focus on renting and enjoying the time.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:07.020]   This is when my wife and I, we tried to do a bunch of traveling, went on ski vacations,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.180]   and we did things that would be more expensive when you're buying right now, if you go out
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.220]   to dinner and you're buying four or five meals versus two.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.780]   So we focused on doing some of those things that are really fun to do with two people
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:23.140]   that are much more challenging to do later when you have more mouths to feed, more Lyft
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.700]   tickets to buy, more ski rentals to do, all of that kind of thing.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.700]   So that's the principle.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.160]   Now let's talk practical.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.540]   Do you, are you and she settled that where you are is where you think you'll be for coming
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.220]   years or decades, or is there any question about that?
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.580]   No, I think we'd stay in this area.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:50.700]   My family's in this area and the job opportunities for both of us are really good.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:56.780]   I'm in a settled career, I'm working for local government and she's got a lot of job opportunities
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.620]   in her field in the Boston area.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.740]   Okay.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:06.960]   And do you have money saved where you can afford to buy a house?
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:13.760]   So I certainly could afford to buy a house right now if we so made that decision, but
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.140]   it would be a big mortgage, which I want to avoid.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:21.100]   So I probably have about maybe 200 that I could put down towards the house right now.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:29.140]   But I mean, in the Boston area, you're looking at maybe six, 700, the cost of houses for
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.980]   just something, you know, halfway decent.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.340]   So I'd want to say about more if we did make that choice in the future.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.900]   Is your wife a semi-recent Indian immigrant or was she born and raised here in the United
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.060]   States?
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.980]   She came over here for school for a PhD.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:50.540]   Is she, does she retain some of that flexible immigrant mentality where she's willing to
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.260]   live differently than many U.S. Americans live or is she fully acculturated?
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.740]   She says, this is what I'm going to live and this is how I'm going to live and I'm not
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.740]   taking anything less.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.220]   No, she's amazing.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:04.780]   She's got all the wonderful benefits that they always talk about that immigrant mentality.
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.780]   Good.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.220]   So that's a blessing.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.220]   Definitely.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.940]   I'm very, very, very blessed, very fortunate to have her.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:14.940]   Good.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:16.940]   It's, that's a real blessing.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:22.740]   Cross-cultural relationships and things like that bring, can bring a unique set of challenges,
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:28.420]   but they can also bring a unique set of blessings just given the varying background and if you
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.180]   fit well with the Indian culture and if she retains some of the wonderful things about
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.560]   that culture, that's a real blessing.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.420]   So I would explore options and here would be a couple of things.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:43.500]   Number one, the most important thing is to get clarity on what your plan is and her plan
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.460]   is together.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.780]   How much, you know, you mentioned I want to build a plan for financial independence in
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   10 years.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.780]   What does that mean?
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.660]   Does that mean you want to quit your job in 10 years?
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.980]   Does that mean you want to be able to quit your job in 10 years?
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   Does that mean you want to build a business?
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.980]   You know, she has a PhD.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.580]   Is that for, does she have some area of research she wants to pursue?
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.100]   Is what is the, what are the family goals?
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.820]   And I would just spend a lot of time writing down those dreams, those goals, and working
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:15.620]   on those things together to see what your long-term plan is.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.980]   And just spend a lot of time in communication, spend a lot of time dreaming, spend a lot
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.980]   of time writing those things down.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.980]   I would spend a lot of time-
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.460]   Yeah, that's exactly what we do.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.420]   Yeah, every month we go over our budget and talk about our values and goals and how we're
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.420]   accomplishing it.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.420]   So yeah.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.420]   Good, good.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.860]   Then the next thing is spend a lot of time trying to figure out, the best that you can
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.340]   determine, what do you think that you and she would like to have?
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.060]   What do you think that you would need?
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.260]   What kind of place would you like to live in?
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:48.700]   There are benefits if you buy, let's say you buy a duplex or a triplex or a quadplex, something
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.740]   like that.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:53.020]   You may have the money where you could be able to buy something like that, and that
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:58.740]   can be a really valuable way for you can get some tenants, which will pay you rental income,
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.800]   and yet you can have your own space.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.820]   So you have the benefits of having additional rental property that helps to build your net
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.900]   worth, but it also gives you a place to live.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:13.300]   If you can do that, it's not quite as nice of a luxury lifestyle as it is to have all
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.100]   four walls be your own, to have a big old yard all around you and a beautiful oak tree
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:23.500]   that's yours alone, but for a young married couple or for a couple with young children,
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.060]   that can be really, really, really, really valuable.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:32.620]   And if you and she are willing to take those lifestyle challenges, we'll say, where it's
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:39.620]   not quite the easiest, most fancy life, that can make a huge difference in your financial
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.620]   situation.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.760]   So you talk about that.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.600]   Is that a sacrifice that you're willing to make?
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.960]   In general, from my experience, I would say this.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.320]   From the time of newlyweds up through the time your children start to reach, say, the
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:59.000]   ages of four, somewhere in that range, three, four, five-ish, no hard and fast rule, you
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.040]   can pretty much live anywhere, do anything, and it really doesn't much matter if you live
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.480]   in an apartment or if you live in a house in the suburbs type of things.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:15.120]   Once your children start to reach three, four, five-ish, or once you start to have a houseful
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   more than two children, you start to appreciate something as simple as a backyard.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.520]   There's a reason why demographically today, young single people and young married couples
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.360]   often like to live in a city, and then as they have children, they often like to move
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   to the suburbs.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.640]   That has not changed.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.600]   Demographic shifts are happening, but that has not changed.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.440]   And the reason is as simple as wanting to open the door, toss the kids in the backyard
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.560]   and say, "Please, I need some quiet in the house."
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.060]   So that's really, really valuable, but you don't necessarily need that now.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:50.320]   So given that you're working towards financial independence, I would personally look around.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.160]   I would start in just the apartment that you are.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.560]   If she's willing to do some kind of house hacking, like I described, big house, have
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.560]   tenants, et cetera, that can be a major boon to your wealth.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.080]   I would try to buy something like a duplex as my first property.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.160]   If you can buy a duplex or a triplex, you live in it yourself, rent out the other units.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.800]   Oftentimes you may be able to make the mortgage work where it'll cover most of your mortgage
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   payment.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.520]   And then when you move out to the next place, if you can continue on selling when your kids
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.040]   start to reach a certain age, then you can move into that larger single family house
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.520]   that fits your lifestyle more.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.880]   Final comment, you've got to shop the market and you've got to be patient.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.540]   Real estate, the timing of the buy matters.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.540]   It matters hugely.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.880]   So that's where you need to put on your prognostication glasses.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.360]   Look at the Boston economy, look at the local market, study it, study the historical trends
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:45.200]   and ask yourself, is now the time for me to be buying real estate in the Boston area?
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.620]   Especially if you're looking into rental property, I would spend some time talking with investors
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.400]   and try to figure out what's the ratio, what's the price to rents ratio, are there deals
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   right now?
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.980]   Is this a good time to buy or is this a good time to sit tight?
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.260]   And this stuff matters.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:05.340]   If you can time it well enough, it'll make a big difference to you, especially being
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.140]   in a big economy.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.140]   But all of those things are local considerations.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.820]   Is that helpful?
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.220]   It's all the stuff that I've been thinking of.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.620]   I just, like I said, I really value the advice you give your guests and wanted to make sure
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.940]   I wasn't missing some subject or some area that I should be thinking about.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:30.700]   I did look into the idea of duplexes a while back, but I don't think it suits my specific
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.700]   needs.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:36.660]   I don't know, just my goals or the quality of those houses always seem to be because
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.580]   of zoning board and regulations and things like that, really, really old homes.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:45.260]   And even if they had been redone, there's still a lot of just maintenance upkeep issues
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.300]   that I didn't want to get into along with tenant stuff.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:53.220]   So I did explore that option a while back and kind of determined that wasn't a path
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.220]   that I wanted to go down.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:41:00.220]   I'd rather be more efficient with budgets and stuff like that, as opposed to getting
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.220]   into that area.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.220]   But I appreciate the advice.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.500]   That's definitely a path to look into, at least for people.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.700]   All those things are localized scenarios that you need to understand on a local basis.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:14.860]   Here would be my final encouragement to you, something that I learned.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:21.060]   Housing is not particularly important to me as an individual.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.900]   When I talk about crazy stuff, living in a car, living in an RV, living on a boat, living
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:32.020]   in a tent on the beach, my personality and my goals, I would be perfectly happy to live
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.540]   in those contexts.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.140]   And I'm a pretty extreme – I'm a pretty radical guy.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:41.380]   So when it comes to financial independence, things like that, I would.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.620]   I would not in South Florida.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.900]   I like air conditioning too much.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.500]   But if I lived in a place that was a little cooler, I'd set up a canvas wall tent and
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.860]   a wood stove and live in that.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.860]   I would.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:58.580]   I'd be that guy in the gold rush who was going out and living like a hobo out on the
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.700]   land to do a gold rush.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.700]   So what happened, what I learned is I brought a lot of that to my marriage.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.020]   And my wife is wonderful.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.640]   She is not high maintenance.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.740]   She is just a wonderful woman.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.580]   But I was so intense that in the early part of our marriage, I didn't spend all that
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.340]   much time listening to her.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.580]   And I was starting with always the number one thing being the money, the money, the
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.580]   money.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.580]   How do we do this efficiently?
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.100]   After all, we got to have the most efficient plan to financial independence.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.580]   This is the most important, financial independence, financial independence.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.380]   And I forget the exact circumstances.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:39.780]   But one day, I just woke up and the Lord really convicted me and I just realized that I was
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:45.860]   not listening and honoring what was important to her because – and I realized that I was
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:51.540]   diminishing by my constant commentary on housing, by my constant thing about, "Look at all
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.780]   these wasteful people and living in these giant mansions when they could live in a shack
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.380]   by the river and be just as happy because they had all kinds of free time."
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.020]   I wasn't listening to what was important to her.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.540]   I wasn't paying attention to it.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:06.340]   By always focusing on the money, I was diminishing that.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:11.460]   And I realized that our house is very, very important to my wife.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.540]   Most of her work comes out of and relates to our home.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:21.580]   And so it's important to her in a way that's different than it's important to me.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.740]   And I really realized that I had not honored her.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.740]   I had not loved her.
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.860]   I had not understood what was important to her.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.660]   And I resolved to change and I resolved to change.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:39.020]   And so I started to focus and make a bigger focus of making sure that home projects were
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.020]   done.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:45.540]   I sought to make sure that she had plenty of money available for any kind of home changes
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:52.700]   that she wanted to make, any kind of decorating things, anything that was important to her
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.860]   that I made sure to do that.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:59.540]   And I stopped talking about stupid things and started honoring the value of living in
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.100]   a beautiful, comfortable home.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.060]   And she really appreciated that and has appreciated that.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.580]   Now you don't have to be stupid with it.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.920]   We still live in kind of a lower class neighborhood at the moment.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.780]   We live very modestly, but there are certain things about our house that aren't great and
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.600]   we'll change that in days to come.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.340]   But I think that attitude made a big difference.
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:27.260]   So as one encouragement from one who's a few years down the road to you as another newly
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.880]   married man, I would encourage you, make sure that you're honoring the things that are important
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:40.160]   to her and recognizing the fact that she looks at the world differently than you do.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:47.080]   And if you honor her and make sure that everything that she needs is your priority first, there's
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.280]   a real truth to the aphorism, "Happy wife, happy life."
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.840]   I always come at it, I do all marriage counseling from a biblical perspective.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:00.780]   The scripture says, "A man should love his wife as he loves himself."
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.280]   And so that means that as I love my wife, that's an extension of it, that I always look
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   and try to understand and look through her eyes and see what's important.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:19.160]   And that means that finances and getting the cheapest place to live is not always the best
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.160]   plan.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   So good luck.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.160]   Congratulations on your marriage.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.800]   Give yourself to it and you will find the rewards are tremendous.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.640]   I think that's something that needs to be applied in frankly, just about every area
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   of life.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.920]   I think it's related to housing.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.920]   Remember, money is not the God.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.280]   Money makes a terrible master.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.360]   And those who put money as their number one priority of how can I get the most money,
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.000]   I mean, there's a reason why we don't think highly of the word miser.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.880]   You always picture some guy out in the back of his, some lonely old bearded hairy smelly
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.840]   man out in the back of his shack with a rusty mason jar filled with coins, counting his
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   stacks of money.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.240]   And he's lonely and he's miserable, but the money is his master.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.000]   It's like Gollum in Lord of the Rings.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.320]   My precious.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.460]   Money is a terrible master.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.460]   Money is a slave.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.280]   It's a servant and it should be used to meet the needs of humans.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.520]   The resources are here to meet your needs.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.020]   And so that means that they'll change over time.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.560]   If you spend all the time meeting all of your wants as fast as possible, you never have
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.200]   any money and then down the road, the needs are never met.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:27.320]   But if you do it right and are careful, but always prioritize humans and always prioritize
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.280]   life, then you can really get the best of both worlds.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.920]   You can enjoy the abundance and the freedom that plenty of money brings and you can enjoy
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:40.080]   the peak life experiences that make the difference of having a life worth living.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.520]   Life worth living is not measured by arriving in the cemetery as the richest dead guy among
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.800]   the many.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.640]   Life worth living goes much deeper.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   Money is a servant.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.640]   It's a slave.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.640]   It's something that should be used to build a big life.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   All right, that's it for today's show.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   I'm your host, Adam McLean.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   I'll see you next time.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   Bye.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   Happy Friday, happy weekend, happy Labor Day weekend to you.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.480]   If you celebrate holidays such as that, I hope that you enjoy the time away.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:09.920]   Remember, as with many things with Friday, make this weekend a special weekend.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.920]   Plan something special.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.680]   My family and I, we're leaving town.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.800]   We're going to go and visit some friends.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.600]   Really looking forward to that.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.040]   Make the day special and plan for it and make a peak experience.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.160]   A little bit of thought in advance can take many experiences from ordinary to extraordinary.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.160]   Hope you've enjoyed the show.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   Hope it's served you.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   Hope it's given you something thought-provoking.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:45.860]   I'll be back with you next week.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:48:09.420]   This is the Radical Life Media Network.
