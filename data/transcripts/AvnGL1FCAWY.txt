[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Well, recently we've received a lot of important questions on 1 Thessalonians 4, 16-17, that
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.280]   famous rapture text. Here's one from Jonathan who listens to us from New Jersey. "Hello
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.520]   Pastor John, it's fairly typical to hear Christians say of someone who has passed away,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.020]   'They're with Jesus now.'" But in 1 Thessalonians 4, 16-17, it sounds like Paul
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.200]   is saying that Christians who have died will meet Jesus at the second coming. Do Christians
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.400]   go to be with the Lord when we die? Or will we meet him when he comes back to earth? I
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.840]   guess what I'm asking is this, when a Christian dies, what comes first, seeing Jesus or being
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.640]   raised from the dead?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.880]   The reason this is an excellent question is because 1 Thessalonians 4, 16-17, really do
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:02.800]   sound like what Jonathan says, that believers who have died are raised from the dead, and
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.280]   in that sense, first meet the Lord at his coming, rather than immediately meeting him
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.880]   when they die. It sounds like that. But I'm sure that's not what Paul means there, and
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.320]   I'll try to show why. I think it's really plain from two passages of Scripture that
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.460]   Paul was certain that when he and other believers died, they would go immediately to be with
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.960]   the Lord Jesus and see him in that moment. And here are those two passages, 2 Corinthians
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:53.020]   5, 6-9. "We are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body,
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.260]   we are away from the Lord. We walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we are of good courage,
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.080]   and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord." Those are the
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.400]   two alternatives that Paul sees. I'm either here in my body, in one sense, away from at
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.360]   homeness with the Lord, or I die and I'm at home with the Lord. Now here's verse 9. "So
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.640]   whether we are at home or away, whether we're with him or here, we make it our aim to please
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.180]   him." Now, Paul did not conceive of a time when the body dies and we are not at home
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.280]   with the Lord. To die is to lose the body temporarily and go to be at home with the
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   Lord. This is not his first choice. I mean, that's one of the things we might correct
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.960]   at funerals, is not to give the impression that he disembodied at homeness with the Lord
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.680]   is the first apostolic choice. His first choice is, "Oh, that the Lord Jesus would come before
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:17.320]   I die and overclothe my body with eternal life." But, he says, if we die, it was better.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.320]   So his third choice is, "Stay here and work." His second choice is, "Go to be with Jesus
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.680]   without my body." His first choice is, "Come, Lord Jesus, and give me a new body so that
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:36.320]   I never have to be bodiless." The other passage is Philippians 1:22, "If I am to live in the
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.360]   flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet, which I shall choose, I cannot tell. I'm hard
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:53.800]   pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account." Now, those are the two possibilities
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:11.080]   for Paul, and one of them was not to die and have the soul lie in the grave sleeping. That
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.280]   wasn't the choice. Die and have the soul lie in the grave sleeping until the second coming.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.720]   No. The two possibilities were, go on living here, or go to be with Christ, which is far,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:35.880]   far better. So I conclude Paul had no doubts about being united with Christ with conscious
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:44.320]   joy, by faith, in this life, and it would never be interrupted by death, and when he
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.680]   left his body, when he was martyred, he would go to something far better than even the communion
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.440]   that he enjoyed with Christ here. Now, let's say a word about 1 Thessalonians 4. And here
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.680]   you've got to put on your thinking cap, because I'm sorry, the logic of this text is so important.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.360]   I think it's clear, but it's complicated. It goes like this. "Since we believe," this
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.440]   is 1 Thessalonians 4, we'll start at verse 14, "since we believe that Christ died and
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:26.120]   rose again, even so through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep."
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:34.080]   Now that sounds like he means to bring them with him from heaven, where in fact they are.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.240]   In fact, there are souls in heaven. We just argued for that from 2 Corinthians 5:8 and
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.680]   Philippians 1. Now, verse 15, "For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:03.080]   fallen asleep." Now that, too, might sound like we are already in our souls, body in
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.960]   the grave, souls with Jesus in the presence of the Lord, and in that sense, those still
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:20.360]   on earth have not preceded them into the presence of Christ. But here's the problem. Now comes
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:28.640]   the argument, the argument for why those who are left, who are alive, will not precede
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:36.600]   those who have died. It goes like this, verse 16, "For because," we won't precede them,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:44.000]   "because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.160]   of the archangel and with the sound of the trumpet, and the dead in Christ will rise
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:57.080]   first." That's why we won't precede them. They rise, they rise first. "Then we who are
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:05.600]   alive, who are left, will be caught up together," not a first and second, "together with them
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.160]   in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord." So
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.560]   the argument for why those who are alive at the Lord's coming will not precede those who
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:28.240]   have died is that those who have died will rise first. Then we will all go together,
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.960]   no ranking, "Oh, you got to go first," together to meet the Lord in the air. No first, no
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:43.800]   seconds, all together. So here's my conclusion when I put these three passages together.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:52.720]   Precede in 1 Thessalonians 4:15 does not refer to the dead preceding the living into the
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:00.880]   presence of the Lord in heaven, which of course they clearly do. Paul's just not talking about
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:11.740]   that. Rather, precede refers to preceding with a resurrection body into the glorious
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.080]   experience of the second coming. Let me say that again, because that's what the argument
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:26.240]   of verses 16 and 17 demands that precede means. Precedeâ€”we won't precede the dead. Precede
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:33.280]   where? Preceding them with resurrection bodies into the glorious experience of the second
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:42.560]   coming. In other words, what Paul is saying in 1 Thessalonians 4:15 is the living won't
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:51.140]   have any advantage over the dead when it comes to the fullest enjoyment of that day, that
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:09:02.080]   resurrection second coming day, including bodily sight and enjoyment and bodily celebration
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:09.940]   of the second coming, because the dead in Christ shall rise first. In other words, before
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:16.460]   there is any glorious gathering to meet the Lord in the air, the bodies of all believers
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:23.500]   who have died will be raised from the dead, reunited with their souls, and then the entire
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:31.840]   Christian Church, the living and the resurrected, will together meet the Lord and welcome him
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.920]   to establish his rightful kingdom.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.920]   Wow.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.920]   Complicated.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.160]   Yes, it is complicated. Thank you, Pastor John. You know what's not complicated? Get

[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:28.080]   Well, Jesus came to earth in the first Advent. We celebrate this glorious truth in Christmas,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.720]   but there's a second Advent to come, and maybe a third Advent too. In fact, how many
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.640]   times will Jesus return to earth? One more time or two more times? That is a really good
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.400]   question. It's an important question. It's on the table Friday. We'll see you then.
