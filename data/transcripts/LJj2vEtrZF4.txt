[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   It's the third Monday of January, and that means in the States we are celebrating Martin
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.840]   Luther King Jr. Day, a fitting day to step back and assess the current state of race
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.180]   relations in this country.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.600]   And a timely question comes to us from a listener named Mark.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.800]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.120]   What is your sense for where race relations stand, especially in the church right now?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.800]   Are we making any progress, are we at a standstill?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120]   Since 2016 things have been tumultuous to say the least, and I find myself bracing for
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.280]   another hit to these relations in this presidential election year to come.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.880]   Where are you at as you look around today?"
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.040]   Well, let's start with the easy one, the question, the glorious one.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.240]   Where am I as I look around today?
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.680]   Where am I standing?
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.360]   I am standing joyfully and expectantly with King David as he says, "All the ends of the
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.480]   earth shall remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations shall
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.960]   worship before you, for kingship belongs to the Lord, and He rules over the nations."
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.000]   Psalm 22, 27.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.760]   Kingship belongs to the Lord Jesus, and He is gathering His people from all the families
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   of the nations.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.400]   I'm standing with King David.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   Where am I?
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.880]   I'm standing in heaven, exulting with the 24 elders as they sing and praise Christ.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720]   Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.600]   blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe, every tribe, and language, and people,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.300]   and nation, and you have made them a kingdom and priest to our God, and they shall reign
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.880]   on the earth, every tribe, every language, every people, every nation into one kingdom,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   one priesthood.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.040]   I'm standing with the Apostle John and the elders in heaven there.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.040]   Where am I standing?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.720]   Where am I as I look out?
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   I'm running with Jesus, running with Jesus in obedience to His command to do our part
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.720]   in "Go therefore, make disciples of all nations," all nations, not just waiting for them, pursuing
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.740]   them, loving them, wanting them, uniting with them, every one of the ethnicities of the
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.740]   world.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.960]   I'm standing with Jesus in the pursuit of that command.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   Where am I?
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.620]   I'm smiling with Paul on Mars Hill as he looks around at these proud Athenians, and he looks
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.160]   them right in the eye, and he tells them that the blood coursing in their veins is the same
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:54.240]   blood as in the barbarians that they despise, because he said God made from one man every
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.080]   nation of mankind on the face of the earth, Acts 17 25.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.300]   No multiple forefathers, some better, some worse, you know, some one color, some another,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.160]   some smart, some dumb, some fit for subservience, and some fit for rule.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.640]   So one father, Adam, and every drop of every human's blood came from one man.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.320]   Get ready, Ku Klux Klan, we are all cousins.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.660]   Deal with it.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.720]   And I'm standing there happy to have it so, smiling with the Apostle Paul, putting the
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.080]   Athenians in their place.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   Where am I?
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   Where am I standing?
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.840]   I'm standing on the plains in Judea with Jesus, joyfully challenged by the commands, "Love
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.200]   your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who persecute you and curse you,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.560]   and pray for those who abuse you."
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:58.640]   Meaning, even if you want to make a hopeless case for division, Jesus says, "Whatever
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.920]   your divisions, my people, my real people, don't hate back.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.160]   They don't curse back.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   They don't abuse back.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.260]   They love, they do good, they bless, they pray for."
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.960]   I'm standing on the plain with the God-man who ends all race-based hate, all race-based
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.000]   abuse, all race-based cursing.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.200]   So where am I?
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.480]   I'm standing with the hated, cursed, beat up, jailed, sleepless, hungry, most radical,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.600]   most happy Apostle, namely my friend, Paul, whom I love.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.820]   And when he says, "Here, here in Christ, there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.540]   or uncircumcised, barbarian, scythian, slave, free, but Christ is all and in all," whoa,
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.380]   I say, "Well, do we see the difference, Paul?
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.380]   Do we even see the difference between these groups?"
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.780]   I think the answer is yes, but we see right through those seen differences to the new
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:10.940]   creation until the differences become no hindrance to unity, but only a help to joyful unity.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.820]   So where am I standing?
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:21.860]   I'm standing finally at the bloody, wall-breaking, new man-making, hostility-taking cross of
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.180]   Jesus who made us both one and broke down in His flesh the dividing wall of hostility
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:36.180]   to create in Himself one new man in place of two, so making peace and thus reconcile
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.580]   us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.620]   They don't get much better than those words right there.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.940]   So that's my answer to Mark's last question, "Where are you at?"
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:59.180]   As you look around today, and I start there because I think that answer, that glorious,
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:07.180]   biblical, Christ-exalting position is a hundred times more, a hundred times more important
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.500]   than John Piper's fallible estimation about where racial relations are today in America
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.980]   and will always be more important.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.620]   So let me give you three reasons why I say that, that is why it's so much more important,
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.500]   why I'm putting 95% of the emphasis there, and that will shed light on my other answers.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:38.140]   Number one, God's grace and judgment are gloriously unpredictable in human culture, secular and
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.140]   religious.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.620]   If you ask me, "How are you?" and I say, "Fine," the doctor may tell me tomorrow, "I'm dying
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.940]   of cancer," and I had no idea.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.540]   But if I answer, "Not so good, I have cancer," the doctor may tell me tomorrow, "It's gone,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.900]   it's gone."
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.660]   And so it is with God's grace and God's judgment in churches and in culture.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.820]   The moment I tell you what trajectory we're on racially, God can blow it up.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.860]   He's just gonna blow it up.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.180]   He's gonna put me in my place.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.500]   Beautiful things may be on the front burner for us, or more judgment.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.420]   That's the first reason that I put so much emphasis on where we stand, not my predictions
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.760]   about where we're going.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:31.420]   Number two, America is simply too big and too diverse, both secular and church world,
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.500]   for any assessment to be made that would cover every corner of the church and culture.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:45.460]   Just when you point to 10 churches that vote to fly the Confederate flag on MLK weekend,
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:54.180]   somewhere else in this amazing land of ours, 50 churches have sat under faithful, Christ-exalting,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.960]   soul-searching, biblically faithful preaching for the last 10 years, and a thousand sinful
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.380]   attitudes about race have been taken captive and destroyed, and a whole new day is dawning
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.100]   in those churches, right when the other churches are doing something absolutely outrageous.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   That's the second reason.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.900]   It's the country's too big and too complex.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.180]   God's doing more things than we realize.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.500]   And here's the third and final reason.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.580]   It's the most important one, too.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:32.760]   Even though it's right and helpful to see sin and name it, it's a hundred times more
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   important to see the Savior and name the beauty of the salvation He calls us to—salvation
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:50.120]   from the punishment for sinning and salvation from the slavery to sinning, salvation from
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:58.120]   final judgment, and salvation from indifference to present injustice.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:07.160]   Another way to say it is, it's good when MLK weekend blows some fog away from past
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.600]   and present racial sins.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.640]   That's a good thing.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   But it is a hundred times better when MLK weekend blows the fog away from the face of
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:27.880]   Christ and the blood He shed to make us radically out of step with this sinful world.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:35.960]   So Piper's take on the state of the world is of very little consequence.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:43.800]   God's take in the Bible on the truth and the power of His Word, His book, for the sake
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.680]   of every ethnicity, is of infinite importance.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.040]   Amen.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.240]   There's a great hope because the victory at the end is inevitable.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.440]   And may that hope root us today.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.080]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that perspective.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.040]   And wherever you're listening in the midst of your day, driving to work, driving from

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.200]   On Wednesday, we return to look at one of the dominant cultural mottos of our age.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.520]   It's only evil if it harms somebody else.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.000]   What's wrong with that definition of evil?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   We'll find out on Wednesday.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
