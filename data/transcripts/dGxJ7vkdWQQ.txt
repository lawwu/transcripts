[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Welcome to the Bogleheads chapter series.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   This episode was jointly hosted by the Tampa Bay and
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.520]   Retired Life Stage Chapters and recorded March 13th, 2024.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.600]   It features Betsy Pecor, CFA, sharing perspectives
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.280]   about her journey from active portfolio manager
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.000]   to retired passive investor.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400]   philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.200]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.120]   and should not be construed as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:40.920]   And again, hello everybody.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160]   I'm Alan, one of the coordinators for the Tampa
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.400]   Bay and also the Retired Life Stage Chapter.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.720]   We have a very unique meeting on tap tonight
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.880]   with one of our Tampa Bay local chapter
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.960]   members, Betsy Pecor, CFA.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.880]   Betsy is a former active portfolio manager who
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   will share perspectives about her journey from
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.720]   being an active portfolio manager, now becoming
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.440]   a passive investor in retirement.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.200]   And Betsy's husband, Chris, will be assisting us
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.440]   tonight as a moderator, along with Lady Geek
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.360]   helping, and I believe Henry is on as well,
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.720]   and Jim from Chicago.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.640]   I appreciate your help.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.320]   Raj or Robert, if you're on, shoot me a PM
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.640]   and I'll make you co-hosts.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.640]   Rather than me muddling up Betsy's introduction,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.400]   I'll turn the mic over to Betsy's husband,
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.840]   Chris, and let him do that.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.320]   No, actually he's very kindly offered to formally
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.360]   introduce her and serve as moderator
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.440]   for her presentation.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.920]   Thank you very much, Chris.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.200]   And I will turn the mic over to you now.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.360]   Thanks Alan.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.240]   I'm glad to be here for this and share Betsy's perspective.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.160]   So I'd like to introduce my best friend, my wife,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.040]   a mother of two great kids, my partner in life,
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.080]   and a 25-year veteran of Wall Street, small scap,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.040]   small cap, scap, right?
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.800]   Cap, stock analysis and investing.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.440]   I just, I didn't want to read her resume,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.880]   but I wanted to hit, there's, I'd say,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.840]   seven different moments that shaped her investing career.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.160]   It all started back in 1988 when she graduated
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   from UVM, University of Vermont,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.560]   with a physical therapy degree.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.440]   You say, how the heck did that, where is that relevant?
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.960]   Well, number one, she was able to graduate
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.560]   with a degree in physical therapy,
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.880]   which is no small task.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.680]   It introduced her to the healthcare systems.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.720]   And as she found out later on,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.080]   she did learn that bedside manner was not her forte.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.960]   So that's one of the reasons why she got out of it.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   She did start an investment club in 1997
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.680]   in one of our, in our neighborhood where we lived,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.280]   in Tampa, actually.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.520]   And then while she was still in physical therapy,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.920]   she was trying to get her master's degree
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.200]   in healthcare management at USF.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.440]   And she, she bumped into a guy named Keith Shillett,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.160]   who, who talked to her a little bit about switching
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.560]   to finance, and that's when she switched to a finance major.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.520]   Coincidentally, she also did an internship
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.200]   with Raymond James during that time while she was in school.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.680]   In around 2000, January 2000, we moved to Vermont
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   and she got her first finance job.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.800]   So ended her physical therapy career,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.320]   got into finance at a company called National Life
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.920]   in their corporate finance department, not in investing.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.520]   But that didn't take long because within 11 months,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.760]   she was hounding the Sentinel Investments
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.960]   equity folks at lunch and whatnot in the elevators
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.920]   to to get a job in the investment side.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.720]   So that's when she became an equity analyst.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.320]   And then finally, you know, 13 years
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.560]   after she had her career with Sentinel,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.080]   she was able to get a job at Raymond James
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.160]   and the Eagle Asset Small Cap and Smith Funds.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.680]   So with that, I'm super proud to introduce my wife, Betsy.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.400]   Wow. So hello, everyone.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.280]   And thank you, Mr.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   Peacore, for the kind introduction.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.600]   When I attended my first Tampa Bay chapter meeting
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.520]   for the Bogleheads, I saw Alan kind of raise his eyebrows.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.320]   You know, I told him what my past career was as an active manager.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.560]   And I think he was thinking, why would an active stock picker
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   be at a Boglehead meeting?
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.480]   Was I there to abuse the members?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.720]   Or was I just plain lost?
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.280]   What he and other members didn't realize is that I was actually there
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.920]   to learn from all of them
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.200]   to have a deeper understanding of the Boglehead way.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.880]   Yes, I was very lucky in my 25 year career managing small cap stocks.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.840]   We were able to successfully beat our bogey.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.720]   We gave our clients the return they wanted
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.760]   and at the right level of standard deviation or risk.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.800]   And actually, even to this day, I do still feel
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.840]   that there could be advantages to owning both active and passive products,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.280]   especially when it comes to small and micro cap land.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.240]   But for me and my time and my life of investing,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.920]   it's all about Bogle right now.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.040]   And I will give a shout out in case they're here.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.880]   They might listen to the YouTube after to my daughter's boyfriend, Spencer.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.760]   At Christmas in 2021, he did present me
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.440]   with a Jack Bogle book on passive ETF and passive investing.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.560]   So thanks, Spence.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.720]   So sorry about this.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.680]   I have to go through two different two different screens to get to where I want.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.160]   So for this agenda, there will be two parts to the presentation.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.480]   Part one will be what I call the active management slides.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.680]   I would like to give an overview of how my team looked at the world of small caps.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.240]   I'll provide a number of slides to describe our rigorous investment process.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.720]   And you'll hear that term quite a bit throughout this presentation,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.720]   because it's very important to long term success.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.480]   This include how we found our investments or what you guys might say stock picked.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.200]   Then show you a couple of tools we used every day
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.680]   on a daily basis to kind of monitor the portfolio and some on a quarterly basis.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.120]   And finally, I'll show you an attribution analysis.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.520]   And I'm not I know we have a savvy group here, but I'm not sure how familiar
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.840]   you are with how we were judged by our clients and our
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.680]   and our bosses for how we got paid.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.160]   And then part two will be the fun part, that's retirement.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.200]   I'll show a brief slide of how to compare the two sides
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.720]   of active management versus passive investing.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.360]   Then my adorable spouse will come back into the screen
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.560]   and will answer a few questions that we anticipate people might ask out there.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.520]   But then I'll open it up to Q&A.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   Oh, and before I move on,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.480]   I did put little quotes in purple.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.120]   So in case you get bored looking at the presentation of the slides,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.800]   you can always read the quotes.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.760]   And they are something that I tried to live by.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.800]   And somehow they resonate with me and I hope they resonate with you.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.480]   I should have had you do this, Chris.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.160]   OK, so here's the bio we start.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.600]   Actually, I do want to read the first quote.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.760]   And boy, did you ever need this when you were in a.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.720]   I got it there, I think.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.840]   And boy, did you ever need this on my job?
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.040]   You are never as dumb as you think you are when you are wrong.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.920]   But you are never as smart as you think you are when you are right.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.640]   And since most of the time I was only 60 percent right,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.760]   that was a good thing because I was beating most of my voting.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.680]   I guess I'll point out I was not a typical analyst, as my husband said.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.160]   My bachelor of science degree was in physical therapy.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   I stayed in PT for about seven years before I decided
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.280]   that the health care industry was not for me.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   And I really didn't want to hear about everybody's aches and pains every day.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.000]   So I always enjoyed following stocks.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I think I bought my first company when I was 18 years old.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.200]   And if you need to know, it was Outback Steakhouse.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.080]   I can't remember if I made money or not, but we'll give it that.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.240]   It also helped that my eldest brother, who still remains in finance,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.400]   he started out as a chemical engineer for Pfizer.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.160]   And he also decided to pivot.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.400]   And now he's made his way up to the big ranks and Fidelity Investments.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.600]   He was the one who helped me open my first brokerage account.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.320]   So anyhow, I decided in 1998 or 1997
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.080]   that I would follow this passion as a career.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.840]   And I went back to school, like Chris said,
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.400]   and I obtained my MBA in finance and entrepreneurship.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.520]   It took a lot of time and energy
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.120]   and also a move back from Florida to Vermont to break into this business.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.520]   Because you don't get many looks if you don't have a Ivy League degree
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   or or at least a background in finance or mathematics.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.360]   But I had the I had the passion and I had the drive.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.120]   And I definitely desired a career in small caps.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.160]   So my first foray, as Chris mentioned, was at Sentinel Investments.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   Sentinel was owned by National Life.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.160]   There I was hired as an equity analyst and began.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.480]   And because of my undergraduate degree, the team put me in charge of health care.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.080]   We did very well.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.000]   And the product grew from a little over 200 million to three billion,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.320]   which is which is a fantastic feat.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.880]   And then we actually stopped assets from coming in.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.400]   As one might suspect, though, our team,
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.240]   who at the time had been together for over a decade, began to be pursued by suitors.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.640]   And in 2012, we decided to leave and work for Eagle Asset Management,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.960]   which is a division of Raymond James Financial.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.360]   This was good news to me because it was sort of karma.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.880]   I started my internship where being pro bono equity analyst to now
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.680]   I was being paid in the higher ranks.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.080]   Let's put it that way as a portfolio manager.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.600]   Raymond James also provided the team more flexibility to build new products.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.920]   We didn't have to run a mutual fund.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.080]   We could run SMAs or separately managed accounts
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.960]   and more resources to help us sell the products.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.600]   OK.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   Just hold on a second.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.240]   Sorry about that.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.680]   So the world of small caps, and I didn't put much on this slide,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.120]   I just really enjoy this quote, find what you love and do it
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.440]   every weekend for the rest of your life.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.400]   Find what you're good at and do it every weekday.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.360]   So, again, I think the group that we have here is pretty financial savvies,
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.160]   but just so that you know, the market capitalizations by my team as definition.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.440]   And this is when I ended my career.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.560]   Small cap was defined as 500 million to five billion.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.080]   My team, of course, stayed up towards that one billion mark because of liquidity.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.480]   And we let our winners run all the way to 10 billion.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:48.520]   Mid cap was five billion to 20 billion and large cap was 20 billion and above.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:56.920]   So the world of small caps, so how did I fall into it?
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.600]   I lucked out. I lucked out.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.280]   There was an open at Sentinel Investments on the small company fund.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.560]   This fund was managed by an extremely passionate
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.880]   and somewhat odd portfolio managers if you've ever met a portfolio manager, not me.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.640]   They're they're somewhat different.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.480]   And that said, he and the other analysts who I worked for
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.960]   taught me a great deal about proper investment process thing.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.960]   There goes the term in case you're drinking a beer and.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.520]   And it really became they really became my mentors into the business.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.480]   So the positives, I was excited to follow small caps.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.040]   It was an area on the street where I think you could really add value
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.520]   as an active manager.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.120]   It's just easier to beat the Russell 2000 than the S&P 500.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.480]   And I'm sure you could find many statistics that show so.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.240]   Plus, there's a lot more companies to follow.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.320]   And you could really find your own niche or in a specialty industry.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   I also enjoyed the fact that I could talk to the CEOs
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.000]   and CFOs of many of my companies frequently.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.160]   And you didn't just get put in front of some division head
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.960]   that my counterparts who followed large companies would only have access to.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.120]   Because unless you have a significant amount of AOM or assets
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.120]   under management, such as the T-Rows and the Fidelity's of the world,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.520]   you're not speaking to the corner office.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.720]   Takeout premiums were very exciting.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.360]   I remember Phillips.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.840]   They received a big package for me personally.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.800]   Because they took out one of my companies for four Fridays in a row
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.000]   for a pretty significant premium.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.600]   Thank you, Phillips.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.760]   And we developed our own big picture.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.720]   Everyone talked about the market, the S&P 500, the Dow Jones.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.160]   But I'll tell you, we were able to see signs and symptoms
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.600]   of a different market from the smaller guys, and it gave us an advantage.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.440]   The negatives of following small caps.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640]   Well, later in my career, the market cap moved up.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.600]   It became difficult for us to trade as we grew assets.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.880]   Volatility, both up and down, as you know.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.600]   It wouldn't be so it wouldn't surprise me to see a stock move 50 percent
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.720]   upside or downside.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.080]   And of course, the coverage of our companies was slim,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.680]   which could be an advantage, but we never used the price targets
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.000]   that you'll see the sell side post.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.720]   But we did like to hear what they said about our companies,
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   because sometimes misinformation was an opportunity for us.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.040]   All right, here we go.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.800]   Get in there.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:38.040]   The ever important investment process.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.160]   This is key for when I was an active manager and now as a retiree.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   It's basically the same process, although in Vermont, in retirement,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.680]   I'm using passive investments instead of small companies.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.000]   I'm learning new tools and techniques.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.080]   Instead of small companies, I'm learning new tools to monitor my progress.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.280]   And I'll be checking our performance, my husband and I,
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.760]   at the end of the year with a different type of analysis.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.880]   But for the next nine boring slides,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.800]   I'll review the components of the investment process
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.760]   as an active manager.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   Investment will be the first five slides of how we describe
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.760]   how we found our very high quality companies.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.000]   Then I'll give you two slides that show just a sampling of our tools
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.520]   that we used again to monitor and then finally evaluation,
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.680]   which is the attribution analysis, which I described to you.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:41.280]   Find your investment.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.200]   So, again, I'm not going to go over these slides
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.360]   as you probably all beg me not to in any big detail,
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.000]   but I just really want to demonstrate the due diligence
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.640]   that our team put
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.880]   when we found any of our companies or an investment idea.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.760]   And the order of these slides, by the way, is key to our success.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.960]   Our search always started with management.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.360]   And I used to love it when my companies grew.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.000]   Interesting enough that is that a CEO would come from a larger company.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.440]   They had the right experience to lead the company, hopefully
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.200]   to mid cap or even large cap level.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.040]   For example, I would love to see when a CEO or a leader
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.240]   from J&J, Medtronic or Stryker showed up as the CEO of one of my companies.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:41.480]   Product and market.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.320]   We always needed to know the secret sauce
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.400]   of our companies in one line.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.000]   So this was not only important for our clients.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.080]   But for also for my teammates, a good analyst
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.240]   can give an elevator pitch on any of their companies on any given day.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.480]   Can you do that with your passive investments?
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.920]   Sorry, I have to do that.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:14.720]   Let's see, manufacturing,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.920]   marketing and distributions.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.320]   Operations, logistics and sales are tricky for small companies.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.160]   They had to outsource many of the functions, as you probably read about.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.920]   So you had to be not only aware of your company,
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.440]   but you had to be aware of the company that they outsource
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.120]   their product or their their manufacturing to.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.640]   These relationships are sometimes very key to operations.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:45.520]   Research and development.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.640]   And again, this is just another aspect of the company
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.120]   that we had to do to be that had to be heavily investigated.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.880]   It can be a game changer.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.280]   What I found interesting to me was always to listen to the CFOs of my companies
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.000]   and how they allocated those research dollars to the division leaders.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.040]   Some would do a competition among the division leaders to see who
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.160]   who could come up with the best product or service,
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.680]   and they would receive the bulk of the R&D dollars.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.920]   But some would just use the numbers.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.040]   And finally, last but not least.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.800]   Was our financial accounting.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.120]   Now, I will tell you, we always say valuation for last.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.280]   We wanted to find all those aspects that I just described to you
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.560]   in those four other slides before we did any valuation work.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.720]   This could be this was tricky doing valuation on small cap companies,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.960]   and we didn't want to waste our time.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.880]   There were so many companies out there to study.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.320]   So if they didn't have those high quality attributes,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.840]   we said goodbye without any valuation work.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.640]   So also what this did for us when we were doing our work,
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.200]   it allowed us to determine if we were going to give a premium
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.800]   or a discount to some of these to some of the model
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.520]   to what the model spit out for us.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.320]   And we always, always determined a fair value
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.200]   of where we got into the company and a price target of where we would exit
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.760]   based on what we came up with.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.560]   And again, we use a number of tools and models to determine this.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.320]   And that's basically the find the investment part of the investment process.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.760]   So now a couple of slides on on a sampling of our tools.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:33.880]   Something that passed, yes.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.920]   So first, I have to start with a quote, because I was a practice
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.320]   and physical therapist, but man, is it more important now than ever?
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Bend your knees.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.040]   So anyway, that's that's just a little.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.880]   The next, like I said, this is this tool here is what we call a val table.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.600]   And I know as much as far as I went, not my other team members.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.720]   I ran it every morning.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.320]   And through the years, as you note at the top, this was 2003
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.400]   of the value table that I gave you, but the columns continually changed.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.360]   So we we evolved our process, but not far from where we where we came from.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.640]   But they changed throughout the years.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.720]   But it was a quick and dirty way of where to concentrate your time.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.920]   And maybe I should focus more time on certain areas.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.760]   This particular value table was mine.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.080]   And yes, those are my scribble notes.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.160]   And yes, I somewhat remember what I wrote there.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.600]   The next tool, again, these are just a sampling
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.760]   was called our sector strategy tool.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.640]   It was a one pager.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.320]   This tool was basically a deep dive that each of us did every quarter.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.640]   And of course, I'm presenting you with the health care sector as that was my forte.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.520]   This tool was used quarterly, like I said, to determine
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.800]   if a particular sector was on track and always make sure
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   that we didn't miss out on something.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.960]   And it was a good way to compare the sector performances among the portfolio.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.400]   And I know this sounds between the two tools like we traded quite often,
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.160]   but really, we traded less, our turnover rate, I think, was less than 20%,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.120]   which is actually really good for an actively managed portfolio.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.880]   And that also includes all the money that kept coming into us.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.560]   So it included all our small program trades that we had to do to to invest that money.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:34.200]   All right, the last two slides, hopefully I didn't bore you too much,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.480]   is our attribution analysis.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:44.520]   So I love this quote, and I said it often to my clients as I was leaving the profession,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.840]   the best way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it in your pocket.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.480]   I still, I still crack myself up.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.760]   So anyways, attribution analysis.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.080]   And I'm not sure you folks are familiar with this, but this is how we were paid.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   So we were paid not only by the returns that our companies delivered to the portfolio,
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.760]   but by which I think is measured by selection interaction.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.920]   And that's in the third to the last column.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.760]   But we also were paid by allocation effect.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:27.160]   So did we put enough weight into the particular holding to make a difference from the index?
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.960]   And in this case, the index is in that second set of columns, the Russell 2000.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.040]   So, for example, under health care equipment, the very first line you'll see there,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.880]   I opened it up to the Massimo Corporation.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:48.320]   And Massimo, if you look to the right, was up 62.37% in 2016.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.480]   Woohoo! Good stock pick, Betsy.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.720]   We owned it the entire year, but so did the index.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.880]   So guess what? I got a big fat zero for stock selection or selection interaction, as it's called here.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:08.240]   But we own 98 basis points of it, and the index only owned 15 BIPs.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   So I received a positive contribution of 26 basis points towards the health care performance.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.280]   So 2016, as you can see here, was a very good year for the health care sector.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.240]   It was up 5.3% over the index.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.400]   So just to bring it back to reality, my performance was up 28%.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.160]   The index was down 7.36%.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.520]   And health care was the number one performing sector for the sector.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.960]   But if you looked, and many of you probably are, looking down at the bottom to see the total,
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.440]   you'll notice that, yes, we had a good year.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.480]   We were up 19.2% or 19.92%.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.960]   The index was up 21%.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:00.200]   Unfortunately, so yes, we lost in 2016 by 1.40%.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.120]   But I can't end on that.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.560]   I can't end where the portfolio does crap.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:13.320]   So the very next year, 2017, I will present to you.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.280]   And of course, health care was towards the bottom of the barrel.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.400]   But luckily, if you notice, if you're able to read these tables and I circled it,
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   my stock selection was awful, down 71 basis points.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:34.440]   But because I over-weighted the sector by 17%, the index only had 15%,
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.880]   my allocation effect was up 70 basis points
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.360]   for an overall contribution of only negative 1%.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.480]   So that's not bad, or negative one basis point.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:51.200]   So if you look at total on the bottom, though,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.200]   the portfolio product had a good year.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.680]   We were up 20.6%.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.400]   The index was only up 14.6%.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.640]   So we beat the index overall by 5.96%.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:09.120]   Now, as I describe this whole investment process,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.040]   the investment, the tools, the evaluation,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.800]   I hope it somehow kind of feels familiar to all of you Bogleheads.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.200]   Again, in this case, the investment is based on small cap individual companies.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.640]   The tools were developed by very, very incredibly intelligent IT people
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.120]   who worked for both Bloomberg and Faxit.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.440]   Those are the two platforms that I used while I was an active manager,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.120]   Bloomberg and Faxit.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.440]   And evaluation, of course, is the attribution analysis.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:47.480]   So I'll end my active part of the presentation.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.560]   We're just like, OK, what's what's a day in the life
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.920]   and what was a day in the life of an active manager or analyst?
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.840]   Every morning at 6 a.m., I was checking company company news or holdings.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   Then I was checking the market news.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.640]   Then I prepare for a team meeting, which we had at eight o'clock every morning.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.600]   Then we had between two to ten calls set up with the sell side,
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.200]   the buy side, management teams, competitive companies, others.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.240]   We were always searching for new ideas.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.800]   We built models.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.280]   We had a team exercise that we did
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.320]   and a team exercise is exactly what it's actually what it means.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.160]   Literally, we would exercise.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.440]   So one person would go out for a run.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.640]   We anything we did for 30 to 60 minutes to get us away from the market every day,
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.200]   except maybe during earnings seasons or when we had clients.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.880]   All right, on to the fun part.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.080]   And retirement.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.640]   Now, this is what I anticipated retirement to be.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.240]   I started to be this amazingly fun life with with paddleboard
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.120]   and mountain biking and hiking and just big views.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:06.800]   But wow, for someone who has always been in control, at least financially,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.960]   I felt a total disarray and I'll explain why.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.360]   The I had to consolidate over 20 different accounts
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.480]   with so many different moving pieces, stocks, bonds, alternatives.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.320]   There were HSAs.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.640]   They were backdoor loss that I needed to convert to regular loss.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.200]   And then, oh, my God, I had a husband who was retiring seven months later
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.560]   and I had screwed up his personal portfolio just as much as I screwed up mine.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.320]   So there was chaos.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.520]   And the real kicker.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.480]   Was when I transferred all my separately managed accounts in kind,
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.360]   I ended up with over one hundred and fifty, yes, one hundred and fifty
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.800]   different individual companies or stocks that span from micro to large.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.840]   But at least I felt I could.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.320]   I had confidence that I could consolidate these equity positions over time.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.440]   But oh, no, the confidence slowly began to be waning.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.040]   Because I realized one of these SMAs that I had transferred over
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.120]   had over a hundred individual bond positions in government,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.960]   munis, corporates, ABS, ABS.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.640]   I had no clue what that asset backed securities,
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.400]   of which I knew nothing about bonds.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.520]   Now, you might ask yourself, so how did someone so knowledgeable
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.240]   in markets allow herself and her spouse's personal portfolio
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.640]   to become so complex?
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.840]   Well, I'll give you the answer.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.640]   It was my gang compliance department at Raymond James.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.680]   They encouraged us all, all active managers to hire
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.520]   a Raymond James financial advisor and allow some of our assets
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.600]   to be managed by a person basically given up our trading rights.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:59.080]   Because the SEC likes to see that among those of us
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.360]   who manage assets, reduce our conflict of interest.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.800]   So just like some of you out there who have experienced,
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.840]   Chris and I sat down with a financial advisor,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.560]   a really good guy who proceeded to go through our goals,
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.760]   our investment risk levels, and kind of et cetera, et cetera,
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.400]   to follow a certain plan until we hit retirement.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.280]   And just like all of you out there.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.480]   I came to the conclusion that after I retired because I had to pay
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.240]   my financial advisor, just like you, that I would say goodbye to him.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.040]   Who is still a good friend, by the way, and become a do it yourself.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   But I need a serious new plan.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.080]   And after much research, including just like all of you,
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.760]   I read retirement articles on Morningstar, on Motley Fool,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.480]   on brokerage sites where like houses like Fidelity and Charles Schwab.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.040]   I listened to 100 podcasts and I watched many YouTube videos.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.200]   And I finally decided to go with the Bogleheads.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:07.880]   Yay. So the ever important investment process comes back to us.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.280]   But in this case, we're not looking at individual companies.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.800]   They are well known, maybe a few.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.840]   I still have not so well known passive ETFs in a very diversified categories
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.400]   that I think will provide my husband and I solid returns for the next 30 to 40 years.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.960]   Tools, I have brought it down to just a few tools
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.320]   to monitor both our cash flow and our portfolio.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.000]   So just for example, I use Tiller for budgeting, although I was a mint person forever.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.040]   That helps with budgeting.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.200]   I use personal capital, similar to Allen, to monitor my overall portfolio.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.360]   But I also, like many of you, have a self-built Excel file
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.080]   that I created many years ago and I keep tweaking.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.760]   And now I have it linked to a service called Why Sheets
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.240]   that just provides pricing and dividend data that I will never let go.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.800]   And evaluation.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:04.080]   So now I use new retirement to build a fairly sophisticated plan
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.920]   with a bunch of well thought out assumptions.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   And it's all based on assumptions now.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.000]   But that's similar to what I did when I planned a price target of fair value
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.720]   to determine if if we can continue to live the retirement style that we like
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.920]   and not outlive our assets.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.160]   I also use e-money with Fidelity for a double check.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.680]   And I still question myself whether I should consult with a financial advisor,
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.080]   maybe a fee only advisor once a year just to confirm our plan.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.240]   So in summary.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.640]   Let's see if I can find the summary.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.560]   What's the difference?
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.880]   I'm just going to read the slide and I'll let you guys read the slide.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.400]   So an active portfolio management versus retired passive investor.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.320]   I focused on a rigorous investment process.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.880]   Bogle headway use a simplified process, which I find much easier.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.840]   Quality back then meant finding high quality companies.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.160]   I showed you all the things we did to evaluate.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.600]   Now I use a highly diversified passive ETFs or funds.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.680]   I think I'm leaning more towards ETFs just to minimize my cost valuation.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.560]   I had to do a number of methods to determine fair value and price target.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.440]   They included assumptions.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.480]   Now I use proper asset allocation to minimize our taxes balance.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.400]   I set up a portfolio with the right mix, including appropriate sectors.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.880]   Here, balance includes.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.840]   Guess what?
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.920]   Never time the market.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.320]   Stay the course by rebalancing annually only if necessary.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.000]   So with that, I will lead us to the question and answers,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.720]   which is the next slide.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.400]   And Alan, I think I'm going to let Chris go ahead with our canned questions first.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.080]   If that. Yeah, that's great.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.040]   Fantastic, Betsy.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.720]   It's really interesting to see how the the Wall Street
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.680]   insider sausage is made behind the scenes.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   And there it is.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.720]   That's that's a cookbook.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   That's a recipe right there for any of you.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.920]   Absolutely fascinating.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.120]   I wonder how many active managers, you know, any other active managers
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.240]   in retirement who have embraced passive.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.440]   Investing over that file or similar.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.960]   They're all telling me to go to hell.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.240]   Now, I'm just that's that's basically the ones who are still working in the business.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.080]   I have not.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.360]   I actually tell you the truth.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.400]   I'm I'm the my colleague does use a number of ETFs
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.000]   to use for his portfolio just because we find that
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.720]   it was a stressful position.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.040]   And a lot of us are just done with it, you know, so well.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.800]   Yeah. Right.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.720]   Before we get on to the questions, I was going to point out.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.360]   Interesting. Today, I was walking and listening to the current
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.720]   Morningstar Longview podcast, and they had on.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.920]   You may be familiar with this individual from Wasatch Global Investors
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.880]   based in Salt Lake City.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.280]   They had the CEO, J.B.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.360]   Taylor, who is a small cap fund investor talking about his process,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.520]   their process for stock picking.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.360]   Quite interesting with Ben's interviewing him.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.840]   That's cool. Yeah, I do know of James.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.400]   Yes, I have met him.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.360]   He's a growth guru.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.240]   He's more growth. But yes, I have more growth focus.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.240]   Yeah. Yeah. All right, Chris.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.360]   OK, we'll start with the ones that she
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.760]   prepared for me, and then we'll get into some of the ones.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.000]   Thanks, everybody, for hitting the chat.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.120]   And we'll get to those for sure.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.360]   So, Betsy, we've been in our household.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.800]   Vanguard passes investing zones, always known as the evil empire.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.200]   Yes. So how are you going to turn your back on active investing,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.800]   especially in the small companies you've invested in for years?
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.680]   That's a great question.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.360]   Thanks. I thought so.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.600]   Yes, I Vanguard was always known as the evil empire and
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.760]   and they continue to gain assets and continue to gain assets
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.000]   as as active managers continue to watch.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.280]   And that's why I think you see Fidelity and T.R.O.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.480]   take a take a bit into that that foray.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.400]   So for me, I'm not really turning my back on active investing,
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.800]   but I just know that.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.160]   What it takes to pick good stocks, as far as my mentality goes,
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.840]   I don't have access to the people, to the tools, to it,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.200]   to the to what I needed to do for a deep dive into small companies.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.480]   Now, that being said that I still own a few names to this day.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.240]   But just like the market constantly change, so do companies.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.440]   And I know there's going to be a point where I can't follow it as closely
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.360]   and tell you the truth. I just don't want to.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   Good. OK, so what do you tell someone
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.920]   who wants to or desires to pick their own stocks
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.880]   instead of investing in an index?
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.480]   I'd say good luck.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.200]   I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.960]   There there's definitely opportunities to find,
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.200]   especially in small companies, an advantage over the market.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.720]   I do believe if you follow a company closely and maybe you have access
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.880]   to Yahoo Finance and Google Finance, that you could probably do a decent job.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.600]   And sometimes it's just a hobby for people.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.160]   So go go for it.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.040]   But that being said, I truly believe, and especially as I've learned,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.640]   that index investing, you're going to get a solid return over the long term.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.360]   It's a buy and hold.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.960]   And I believe in it. I believe in those returns.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:34.200]   And you can't go wrong with a nine percent, nine, 10 percent return
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.400]   in an index investment.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.200]   Well, like you said, you guys had a good year and you're six percent over the index.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.520]   So that's but that's a lot of work to get to be six percent over.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   So and then we lost we lost the year before.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.360]   So, yeah, so it's just it's just super hard.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.560]   And you had you had access to the tools faster.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.240]   Yes. Like Yahoo and others aren't as fast as Bloomberg.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.600]   We had news.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.960]   I'll tell you right now, anything you see on CNBC,
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.240]   we knew it three hours before you got told.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.600]   So, yeah. Oh, especially in small, maybe not large.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.760]   So we've got we've had 80 to 90 people on here.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.400]   Can you give us a hot stock tip?
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.440]   A hot stock to follow the ball go ahead and win.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:30.480]   All right. So it's only been a little over a year
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.960]   that you began following the bottle head method.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.520]   So are you there's two parts of this.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.720]   Are you truly there?
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.400]   Meaning do you say your portfolio totally looks like a like a bottle?
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.960]   Yeah, no. As Alan or any of you
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.160]   probably know, when you
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.320]   adopt a portfolio of one hundred and fifty stocks and you adopt
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.600]   one hundred bonds, there's no way I can change.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.560]   Although I would love to change in a day
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.120]   to get everything moved over.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.840]   I have been moving towards that way.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.080]   I bet you don't take me at least three, if not five years,
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.280]   if not 10 years to become completely vulnerable.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.360]   Well, that relates to a question that Steve had, you know,
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.040]   that we have a big tax bill.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.640]   If you just converted everything over and sold everything off.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   You're exactly. Is there anything else to that?
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.880]   I mean, some of some of those sales weren't necessarily taxable.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.280]   Is that true or?
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.800]   It is true. It is true.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.480]   I thought it was a mix.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.360]   It was a mixture because my financial advisor
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.400]   not only had taxable money, he had tax deferred money.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.760]   And I believe I ran my small, very small Roth at the time.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.040]   And and then, of course, my company had a lot of other products
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.960]   that they were managing for us.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.560]   OK, so with the Bogle method, is there
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.760]   is there anything you see for improvement with this methodology?
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.160]   Well, I'm glad Lady Geek was on here earlier and I will bring her up
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.200]   because as I told her and she and she admitted that the Bogle
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.720]   head site was created as a billboard site many, many years ago.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.400]   And right now I'm lost.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.440]   I'm a little lost.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:17.080]   So I find myself, as you all feel as an analyst.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.680]   I find a link and then I go to the next link and then I go to the next link.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.320]   And but the next thing you know, it's two hours later.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.400]   And I didn't consolidate my brain.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.520]   So I request that maybe we get a millennial.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.000]   I Alan, you took the poll.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.440]   There's hopefully one person who's early retired.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.480]   Maybe they can help us develop a more simple.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.720]   I mean, I actually even went with your suggestion out
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.840]   and looked at the tools provided, you know, the financial tools.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.160]   And that's even that section is kind of tough to to figure out.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.080]   If I can interject for a minute,
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.800]   I think a good starting point for the basics is the Bogle
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.560]   has university that has taken place the last two years at the conference.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.880]   They're concise, short lectures covering specific topics,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.560]   especially the Bogle has one on one for beginners.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.360]   And then the Bogle has five on one that they did this past conference
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.560]   for more advanced topics.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.520]   But yes, the the wiki and the and the Bogle has website
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.880]   can be certainly be overwhelming.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.320]   You can really go down the rabbit hole.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.600]   Well, there's a and if there's any other consolation,
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   I was a civil engineer working for a consulting firm
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   for thirty five years and and our website stunk.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.720]   I mean, we couldn't find anything on it.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.600]   We had mountains and piles of information and things.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.520]   But so they they they need to be updated in general.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.880]   All of them do. Periodic.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   You know, it's just another tool.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.120]   It's like going going through your, you know, your desk
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.000]   and cleaning out the books you don't need anymore.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.560]   You know, so one last question that I got.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.960]   So retirement so far, what's your biggest eye opener, Betsy?
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.600]   Like all of you,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.800]   let's Bogle heads were savers, right?
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.640]   We don't like to spend money.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.280]   And it's been so, so tough for me to let those dollars go.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.360]   So to go from accumulation all those years
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.120]   and not hope the young people hear it to distribution, it's scary.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:20.840]   And you and for some reason you're not thinking you have 30 years.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.920]   You you think that you still have another hundred years for some reason.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.800]   I don't know my brain.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   And and you need to be allowed to spend money.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.280]   And it's tough.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.440]   Betsy, for what it's worth,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:39.480]   I did a column about 10 years ago for Forbes on that exact topic,
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.000]   switching gears, going from saving to spending.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.720]   And I interviewed a lot of people for it and Bogle heads.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.240]   And I was not unique.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.480]   I found out that a lot of people really have a problem.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.600]   And I think the big problem is we don't know how long we're going to live.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.560]   If we did, we could divide
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.960]   and we would know the answer, but we don't.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:09.080]   And the fear of the fear of running out of money is after saving
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.240]   all your life to have a good retirement.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.760]   And then you get there and you're afraid to spend it.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.000]   So it's a it's a common problem.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.920]   And I was guilty of it.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:25.000]   My editor at Forbes was approaching retirement.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.800]   She knew I was already retired.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.080]   So she asked me what it was like.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.880]   And I said, well, that's a good topic for an article.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.680]   And so then I started interviewing the
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.640]   the members and found out that I was not the only one
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.000]   that was really worried about it.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.640]   So, yeah, you're not alone, Betsy.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.880]   Thank you. Thanks, Mel.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.480]   We're trying to spend honestly.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.400]   So you want me to
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.200]   read through some of the questions or you want to take some or
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.320]   why don't we alternate
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.280]   between people who want to raise their hand and ask a question?
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.600]   And then I haven't been following the chat that closely, but maybe
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.160]   some of my co-coordinator colleagues can can read them off as well.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:12.640]   But let's start.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.520]   If anybody has a question they want to ask live, raise your hand, please.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.320]   Don't be shy.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.520]   This will only be viewed by a few thousand people.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:29.480]   Yes, Russ.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   Russ, you had your hand up.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.600]   Yes. Oh, really?
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.640]   Welcome from Wharton, Colorado.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.760]   Hey, first the snow tonight.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.720]   That's what I hear anyway.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.480]   And the wife and I were both 76.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.600]   We've been retired.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.920]   We're both retired military and used TSP and all that,
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.400]   which was in way index funds.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:02.560]   And what I want to say is I use Quicken
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.320]   and they've got a planning function in there, it's really great.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.400]   And, you know, I can say, you know, we're going to do this.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.240]   We're going to do that.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.120]   We want to go there, put money in it and say, OK, what's going to happen?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:21.160]   And they take what we have, our assets, checking accounts, everything.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.360]   And then they run it through
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.440]   and say, OK, here's a graph and this is.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.280]   You're not going to go broke in your lifetime.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.000]   That's that's what I want to hear, because I plan to live to 100.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.800]   That's what I believe.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.840]   I, you know, I can put anything in there.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.480]   I can do all kinds of manipulations.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.080]   The other thing is we are pretty much into Vanguard
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.840]   time dated funds, mostly somewhat
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.080]   2065 for the money that I don't think we'll ever use.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.320]   And then we've got Ross on the side of that.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:02.360]   And then it's still I still have 20, 20 and 26.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.440]   Well, I've got 20, 22, 20 also
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:11.840]   because, you know, it's sort of more safe because there's more bonds in it.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.640]   And I like the 2065 because it gives me a little exposure
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:20.800]   to the international stocks, not so much of international bonds.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.440]   So I wanted to ask
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.880]   with all this money in the 2065 and
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.200]   it's really hard to like move around things.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:40.520]   So what's your position on moving some money from the 2065
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.040]   or any of the Vanguard funds?
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.960]   If you look at the makeup of it, they've got these
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:52.240]   bond funds and stock funds and moving into their ETFs.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.880]   So, yeah, it's you're playing the market more.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   But it's it gives you ability to,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.640]   you know, if it's down, whatever.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.880]   And that's the other thing is we keep we're 76 years old.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.120]   So we keep two years of mandatory
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.240]   required distributions in a money market fund.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.840]   So it's safe. It's cash in the bank.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.680]   It's cash.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.360]   So if the market tanks, we got two years at least of
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.360]   we don't have to worry about us.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.560]   So what we did in 20 was like 2020 and everything is like, yeah, OK, whatever.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.800]   If I can interject for a moment, Ross, I think you're talking about target
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.160]   date funds, I presume, which all the major fund families offer
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.000]   and with varying types of asset allocation.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.160]   So it's only this one that we're there managing the basically the overtime,
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.840]   how the allocation changes, typically, you know, increasing the bonds
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.560]   and becoming more conservative.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.320]   You're talking about breaking it up into this individual components
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.360]   and and managing it yourself.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.000]   Is that what you're referring to? Correct. Correct.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.800]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   I have thoughts on that.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.960]   We'll let people speak, but my thoughts would be as you get older.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.360]   I'd love to hear if you if just my own personal thoughts
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.120]   is that the beauty of a target date fund is it's a sentence, forget it.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.800]   If you agree with the asset allocation and the glide path,
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.840]   you go out and live your life, let the pros manage it.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.040]   Now, if you get older, if you're concerned about cognitive decline
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.160]   or other issues, you want to start taking more responsibility
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.440]   where you're more agonizing and potentially losing sleep at night,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.080]   trying to figure out what to do.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.000]   My philosophy is to simplify things as I get older, not make them more complicated.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.760]   That's my two cents worth.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.840]   OK, thank you. I appreciate it.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.160]   And so I was just going to say, I'm too new to the game.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.240]   I've never I've never invested in target funds.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.760]   I know that they offer them in my 401k.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:06.280]   But I always felt that that was a I don't know, a weak way of investing
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.880]   just from my standpoint, because I was an active manager.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.200]   So I felt like I always wanted my hands in the game.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:17.400]   But again, just like Alan said, as I get older, I need to simplify.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.320]   And I get so frustrated that the U.S.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.280]   government has created this tax system that we have to pay attention to.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.040]   Now, when I was making money, I didn't have to worry about it so much.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.080]   But now we have to figure out this asset allocation
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.560]   and maybe the target date funds are perfect for you.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.160]   But again, I don't feel like I have the experience
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.960]   to explain to you to jump in or out or market time.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:45.800]   I've I've got a set number of ETFs that I feel very comfortable holding.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.280]   And you would know.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.240]   I mean, it's a lot of Vanguard ETFs.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.640]   There's some Invesco ones I found.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.880]   I actually sort now on net expense ratio and find a few.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.920]   And then I go with the cheapest one.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.560]   And if the holdings really don't, they don't differ quite that much.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.040]   I don't I don't know how they get away with charging 20 basis points for one
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.840]   and ten, maybe they're a little bit more specialized.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   But right now, that's what I'm doing.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.200]   Yeah, there are some S&P 500 index funds
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.840]   that still charge like upwards of 75 basis points and get away with it.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.640]   I don't know. Well, we're pretty much Vanguard.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.320]   Yeah, we're yeah, we're all Vanguard.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.160]   Right. Oh, yeah.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.560]   All right. We have I think to tend to you've had your hand up.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.440]   And thank you, Russ, for that topic.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.960]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.400]   And to tend to tend to your muted.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.200]   How do I get in there?
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.440]   Can you hear me?
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.360]   Oh, yes. Yes. Yeah.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.880]   OK. Thank you, Betsy.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.120]   What a nice presentation.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.960]   The point I thought I know I see most of the people like me.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.640]   Bold headed is not bold headed.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.400]   Bold headed is that X is the situation.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.480]   Now, when you do what you were talking about.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:09.720]   Active or ETF and all the game
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:14.520]   I like to play and I'm playing it with individual stocks.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.920]   Which was the one subheading in your topic
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.800]   gives you control to maneuver this
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:26.320]   tech situation like last year when things were bad.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.800]   I look at it.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.280]   How much red I have or how much green I have.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.880]   Then I just bing bing bing.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.600]   My goal was to bring down
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.320]   my income, otherwise it goes Medicare goes up and all that.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.640]   So to that end.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   I know you can do that with ETF some easily,
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:55.000]   but individual stocks takes the advantage because, you know, the date.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.440]   Also, you know, I know it required a little active management
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.960]   because, you know, the date and you said, OK, I want to sell it
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.560]   after January or whatever. And.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.920]   As you know, all of you guys know,
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:14.080]   tax is so low on a long term, it's like a rainfall for all of us.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.320]   What do you think of that?
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.640]   Well, I don't know if I'm the right person to ask that question.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.520]   I might have Alan interject.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:29.400]   So your basic question is, it's better to stay with individual stocks
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.400]   when it comes to the tax situation versus our control over it.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:39.000]   I actually probably agree with you.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.400]   I haven't I haven't seen
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.040]   the tax situation with my ETFs right now.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.400]   I keep all my individual stocks,
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.480]   my growth stocks in my taxable accounts.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.320]   And you're right. I have more control. I decide when I sell them.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.040]   Yeah, I don't have them telling me when they're selling.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.120]   Yeah, but I am.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.400]   I am going to get in trouble because I do use.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.480]   I have to. I don't have my money's not.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.200]   I mean, we're split 50/50.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.600]   I think we did a good job with our tax deferred and our tax
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.480]   efficiency and our taxables.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.560]   But I still have to have a certain percentage in each of the ones
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:20.240]   that I haven't quite figured out how to balance because I've got so many losses
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:25.040]   in these bond positions that it'd be silly for me to sell right now
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.080]   because I just like, well, first of all, I don't like selling at a loss
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.000]   on names that I know will gain because their thoughts.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.640]   No, but I'm sure you know it more than me.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.280]   You can buy in kind next day.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.600]   Yes. Yes.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.440]   Yeah. And you just see one turnpike.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.720]   You buy California turnpike or something like that.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.080]   You're sure it's true.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.320]   But I, I, I just I don't know.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.600]   I decide that it was.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   Active men and men who want to spend the time.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:59.320]   So that's my second question, because I'm I'm all older than you guys.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:03.920]   And as I hear the word from Alan, simplification.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:08.400]   Yes. But I'm sure all of us gets a little.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.520]   I don't want to use the word cake, but jolly out of doing our own thing.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.960]   My broker said, that's your
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.440]   morphine, OK?
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.920]   Otherwise, I go crazy in the morning if I don't do a couple of trade or read.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:27.160]   So and still make the money or at least most of the time, whatever.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:31.920]   So point is, the next question is
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.760]   the simplification.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.680]   Yes. You can buy four or five.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.320]   Kipling are also right.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.800]   Want the best growth and all lowest expense ratio and buy those.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.120]   That's fine.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.360]   But that doesn't get you anything.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.560]   You you can do some tax advantage there.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.840]   If you write the date that you bought it, it's on the screen and sell it.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.200]   Maybe whatever the gain, you got it.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.320]   Maybe it does.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.040]   So any thoughts on.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:05.120]   Stay 60 to 80 percent.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:11.200]   Short of active and 20, 30.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.000]   I have something fun, which is already on.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.440]   I don't even touch.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.680]   It came from old fidelity to swap, whatever.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.160]   So that's my simplification.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.120]   Any thoughts there?
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.320]   Let me interject, I guess if I can speak.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.840]   I guess you're talking about the ability to tax loss harvest, obviously.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.920]   When you have buildings that have declined
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.320]   and that that's a very well accepted bogal head philosophy.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.640]   And if you exchange it for something similar,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.920]   you know, but not exactly the same, you're not you're going to have an issue
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.960]   with the IRS. Yeah.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.240]   So if if if people want to do that, there's actually there are firms now
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.720]   like I think maybe Wellfront, Betterment, others that actually do
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.920]   automated tax loss harvesting for you with a basket of stocks.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.240]   That's active, very active.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.400]   But relatively low expense ratio.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.040]   But the problem is you're you're stuck.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.000]   You're locked into that long term because ultimately you're going to have
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.480]   embedded capital gains.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.160]   It's going to be harder and harder to get out of long term.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.920]   You need to think about what happens to either you or those who inherit the assets.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.320]   Obviously, upon your death, it gets a stepped up cost basis
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.520]   and that'll wipe out any embedded gains if that's what you want to aim for.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:27.400]   But keeping a small portion, if you like to, you know, play around
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.760]   and it's a hobby for you to pick out and play with individual stocks.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.400]   Limited, I say, five to 10 percent of your portfolio
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.520]   is your the fun part of your portfolio that'll scratch that itch
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.760]   and the rest leave it in index funds.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.920]   That way you kind of get the best of both worlds.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.400]   You can also tax loss harvest with with index funds.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   If you have sector funds or a large cap, switch S&P 500
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.880]   for the total stock market or vice versa.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.800]   There's tons of stuff in the Bogleheads wiki about ways to accomplish that.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.840]   Where do you get that?
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   I'm sure Lady Geek can put something in the Bogleheads wiki
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.400]   has a lot of resources talking about tax loss harvesting,
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.480]   and that's all over the Internet.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.920]   You can get that anywhere on the Internet.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.440]   There's videos that talk about that as well.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.160]   One thing I'm going to interject and then I'll get to you, Mel,
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.320]   is talking about, you know, stock picking and such.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.040]   Even if you have small cap.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.600]   So, you know, there's been a lot, Paul Merriman and others
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.880]   who've advocated small cap value is being long term,
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   potentially outperforming the S&P 500.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.520]   The beauty of having, say, a total stock market fund,
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.840]   you have to worry about the small caps who grow and mature
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:44.520]   that are very well run, evolve, become the mid cap, stay in the index.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.920]   You don't have to worry about anything happening there.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.680]   And later on, if they do extremely well, they may move up
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.280]   and become large cap stocks.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.240]   So that's one thing I wish I had done.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.720]   I have a very small percentage of my total portfolio.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.400]   That's actually the total stock market index fund.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.200]   Instead, I have a slice and dice portfolio.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.600]   But I've added the in this case, the Vanguard
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.720]   completion index or the extended market index.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.400]   There's everything but the S&P 500.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.400]   So I've consolidated my small and mid a little bit that way.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.840]   But the beauty of having large index funds
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.400]   such as a total stock market index for total international,
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.000]   you don't have to worry about the gyrations amongst the asset classes
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.840]   within that fund.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:26.680]   They do what they do.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.880]   The best ones will float.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.640]   The cream will flow to the top.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.360]   Others will drop off.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.560]   And it's going to have minimal tax implications for you.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.240]   And it's OK to pay taxes.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.560]   If you're paying taxes, it means you've made money somehow.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:42.120]   And we shouldn't regret that.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.720]   It's just so much.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:49.560]   And I will just interject that, yes, I still have 20 stocks
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.840]   that I am following, but I've whittled it down.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.640]   So but it's still a lot of fun and I probably can't give it up, but I'm trying.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.680]   And every year it'll get worse.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:01.160]   It'll get I know it'll happen.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.960]   You got to wean her off her habits.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.880]   OK. OK, Mel, your hand is up.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:09.360]   Yeah, I just wanted to thank.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.040]   I have to run, so I want to thank Betsy for a very informative
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.160]   and interesting evening.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.480]   And thank you for all you do.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.720]   We'll see you all later. Take care.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.720]   Thank you. Thanks, Mel.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.560]   By the way, for those of you who may not know, Mel was a big advocate.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.880]   They call it Mel's Unloved Midcaps.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.280]   For many years on the Bogleheads Forum and elsewhere,
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.000]   he basically spouted about what a wonderful sector it was, just the midcaps.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.760]   And I think they have long term done done quite well.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.640]   I don't know if it's outperformed the S&P 500 or the total stock market long term,
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.680]   but it's certainly an under an underappreciated
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.880]   segment of the market that's worth looking at.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.400]   Definitely, definitely.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.680]   I call them midcaps and it's great place to be because they've outgrown
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.720]   the small cap status and they're not fully large
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.000]   and you could have a ton of growth potential through them.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.840]   All righty, Pat, your hand is up.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.600]   Yes. When I first started getting
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:15.720]   getting into investing, I didn't really know a lot about the index funds
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.480]   because it was quite a few decades ago.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.160]   But I've definitely kept one of my actively managed funds
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.520]   because it has done extraordinarily well and continues to do so.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:30.320]   And I also found that when the market tanked,
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:35.280]   what went down in that fund, you know, the percentage went down
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.920]   was a fraction of what the index funds did.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.960]   So sometimes, like you said, with the small cap,
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:48.160]   sometimes, you know, the act of investing can can contribute.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.240]   Well, I think the same thing kind of happens
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.720]   with protecting.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.560]   I'm definitely a bogo head and that is, you know, what I'm doing now.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.080]   But I'm going ahead and keeping this one fund.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.440]   And just when I saw it, it only went down a fraction
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.680]   compared to the dive that all my other index funds took.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.760]   You know, it makes me think.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.680]   Over what period of time was that a short term comparison or long term
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.680]   that obviously different asset allocations and sectors
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.040]   will behave differently in the short term.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.320]   But if you're going to hold on to something long term, you want to know
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.640]   how well correlated it is with the total market.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.320]   And is it really providing you any benefit over the long haul?
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.160]   Yeah, this I purchased it in 1992 and I still own it.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.000]   And I think it was during the last decade.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.520]   I can't remember whether it was 2008 or what.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.920]   But when I saw the dive that it took
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.560]   and it never, you know, when the market took a dive,
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.560]   this this actively managed fund never even came close
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.720]   to plummeting to the extent I was fortunate because I was working.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.680]   And I just left everything alone.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.000]   So I ended up when the market came back.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.640]   I was way ahead of the game because I was buying bargains.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.400]   But I just was really amazed, you know, how,
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.760]   you know, when when my other stuff was just tanking,
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.400]   you know, 50 percent and whatever, this was just like a fraction.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.040]   Yeah, it went down, but it wasn't that.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.480]   Horrible, dramatic thing that everything else was doing.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.920]   All right. So he's asking what the fund is.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.920]   Of course, you want to see if it has holdings that are comparable
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.320]   to what you're comparing it against, if it's a bond fund or something else.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.720]   You know, I'll tell you, I'll tell you what the fund was.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.360]   Fidelity Contra Fund. OK.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.560]   Yeah, that's I think, well, long term.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.600]   All that was actively manages relatively low
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.200]   expense ratio for an actively managed fund. Yes.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.280]   Interesting. Yes.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.200]   And of course, again, to remind everybody, we can't give specific custom
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.720]   advising investment advice for everybody here.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.280]   It's just speaking in generalities. Miriam.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.280]   Yes, I was just wondering what the.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:19.840]   Equity bond ratio is Fidelity Contra Fund,
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.000]   because, for example, during the Great Recession.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.720]   My Vanguard Wellington, which is an active fund, a 60 40 fund.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.440]   Did not lose much at all either.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.280]   But it was 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.640]   Fidelity Contra did not do the same as my stock funds,
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.200]   and it did not perform the same as bond funds
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.400]   because the asset allocation was different.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.920]   And also some funds have, especially if they're T.R.O.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.560]   price funds, which I owned at that time.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.800]   They have what we call the kitchen sink put into them.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.880]   T.R.O. price funds do well because they add puts and calls.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.840]   Hedge funds, foreign stocks.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.040]   They put a lot into even their target date funds.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.680]   They put a lot of that stuff in there, specifically so that when the market
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.280]   changes, you will not lose your your principle.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.960]   You will stay up ahead is what they say in their prospectus.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.160]   The difficulty is that the expense ratio is so high.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.480]   You will eventually lose what you gain in your expenses
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.320]   if you hold those funds.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.360]   I might again interject.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.800]   I'm sorry for a moment on this type of thing.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.880]   I don't think we have time.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.360]   I could pull up Fidelity Contra fund and share that with you on the screen.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.880]   But, you know, who does a lot of that is Rob Berger.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.160]   I know Betsy is a big fan of Rob Berger's YouTube channel, as am I.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.720]   And he's really wonderful.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.160]   He's he's been the last two Boglehead conferences.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.360]   He pretty much embraces the Boglehead philosophy, plus or minus.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.480]   And what he does now every other week is does a live YouTube
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:00.840]   and Facebook session for two hours, taking questions and comparing funds
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.800]   and talking about the pros, the cons, comparing their assets.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.920]   And if you watch him, I think this is the sort of thing that he does.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:14.160]   He also is currently compiling on his website, which I think Rob Berger dot com,
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.040]   a whole resource of tools,
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.720]   all the conceivable personal finance tools that are available,
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:28.240]   including links with screenshots of them, his comments on the pros and the cons.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.040]   I actually mentioned that to Lady Geek, and she put a link to his website
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:37.280]   in our wiki because the Bogleheads wiki can't keep up to the extent
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.080]   that he's keeping up with this.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.160]   And I encourage you all to check that out.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.800]   It's Rob Berger dot com.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.600]   And he's got a section there on tools that he's just now compiling,
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.120]   but includes new retirement, you know, empower formerly personal capital,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.280]   a ton of others, and it's going to grow.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.920]   And he says he's going to maintain that.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.080]   So it should be a great resource. Yeah.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:02.600]   I agree. Let me see if I can.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.720]   My guys who are looking at the chat, we have any specific questions here
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.960]   that I have missed, per se.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:14.680]   Somebody posted contra fund is pretty much almost 100 percent equity.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.120]   Yeah, I think the thesis behind the contra fund was it was contrarian, right?
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.960]   It invested in things that were not momentum.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.240]   So she was getting things very cheap, probably cheaper
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.080]   as the market continued to go down, probably did very well.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.280]   Yeah, I don't know if they did any type of things
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.800]   like shorting the market or anything else, any other type of fancy type.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.400]   Roaches, I do have access to someone who's a big wig at Fidelity,
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.520]   so I could ask that question.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.480]   OK, Greg, your hand is up.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.720]   I do. Yeah. Thank you.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.160]   I'm really curious.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.880]   I got several responses to this, including from Chris, which I appreciate.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.040]   But I'm not sure I understand the allegory.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.320]   And maybe I'm just dense.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:03.520]   But earlier you had a slide, some data and you said, bend the knee.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:09.000]   And I know I understand bending the knee may be smart when you're lifting weights.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.400]   But were you talking about lifting weights?
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.600]   I was. I was. OK.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.200]   Those are just all the quotes came from different parts of my life.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.400]   So I remember when we were when I was going through my physical therapy program,
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.160]   the way to actually transfer patients.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.240]   You had to bend the knees always to use your quads
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.600]   because the quads is the strongest muscle in the body and then turn.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.040]   So you only transfer patients from, you know, beds to chairs.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.000]   The way that it was to keep them close to your body.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.640]   And people would sometimes the family member would just, you know,
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.600]   I'm trying to show you, but, you know, they never bend the knees.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.320]   So I had to train them.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.760]   So this does not apply to the financial.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.680]   Oh, no. No.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:56.560]   But every time I saw one of my colleagues go to pick up a bunch of papers or a box,
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.640]   I'd be like, hey, bend your knees.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.360]   I have another question, if I could.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.040]   I put it earlier in the chat.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.480]   If I could move on to that. Sure.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:10.920]   You mentioned that if a CEO moves from Medtronic to one of your companies,
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   that that was a positive indicator for you
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.680]   because they might be able to grow the company. Right.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.520]   But I'm thinking, wouldn't that be a red flag as well,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.960]   or at least something you want to look into?
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.640]   Because there's a lot of CEOs that fail at certain levels.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.440]   And the only place they can get a job is maybe at Company B, which is smaller.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.360]   Well, what I would always do, Greg, is see
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.720]   where in Stryker or Medtronic or J&J that they led.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.320]   And so if I had a company like
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.920]   the CEO from Phillips who ran the electromagnetic division
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.320]   and then my company, that's all my small company focused in on.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.360]   I say, of course, I wanted them because they ran more money there
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.960]   at Phillips than they did with this company.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.480]   So I had a ton of success every time.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:03.160]   Yes, maybe some red flags on somebody just looking for a CEO position
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.080]   that didn't make sense in that area.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.960]   But for me, it always turned out to be a huge positive.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.400]   Ninety nine percent of the time.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.880]   Thank you, sir, to me, it's great.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.720]   It's not it's not the CEO of Johnson and Johnson.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.600]   It's a division leader going from there to be a CEO of a smaller company.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.720]   Yeah, that makes more sense, I think.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.880]   Yeah, correct. Correct.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.720]   Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.960]   Not to see if I saw the CEO of Johnson and Johnson, I'd be like,
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.200]   well, that would be a red flag.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.280]   OK, well, that's that's one of the advantages, obviously, of having an index fund.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.000]   There's no manager risk in terms of a manager leaving and management changing.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.400]   It follows the index.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.760]   Oh, yes. From time to time, the index might change.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.960]   But that's just one less risk that you have to deal with and worry about.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.360]   And there's a lot to be said.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.200]   Again, as we get older, certainly for me.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.240]   I like simplifying and anything that I don't have to worry about
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.360]   just makes my life easier.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.120]   Well, Alan, I could chime in on that, too.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.720]   I know Betsy went through a very tenuous, not tenuous, but
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.560]   long duration planning to retire for that exact reason,
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.280]   because she didn't want the whole thing to go in the tank when she left.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.080]   So they hired a couple, they interviewed, they hired a couple of people.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.280]   They let out the notification at the right time.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.080]   And it was all about we're going to keep our process and we're not changing.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.960]   Betsy's going to leave.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.000]   And that's that's what people do.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.440]   So don't freak out, everybody.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.800]   But that that's a valid challenge.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.200]   And she went through it correctly.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   Yeah, I think Morningstar actually tracks that.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.560]   And one of the one of the measures they track is the team.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.240]   Somebody posted a question here that I'll read about.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.520]   What do folks think of Avantis ETFs?
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.080]   In general, they are actively managed, right, and lower cost
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.160]   and have somewhat different approach.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.040]   So Avantis is kind of like, I guess,
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.480]   a kind of a spinoff from Dimensional Funds, the same concept
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.120]   where they're kind of indexy, but they have another process on top of that
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.920]   for their asset stock selection.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.560]   What are your thoughts, Betsy, as how both of those operate in their approach?
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.200]   So I'll tell you right now, Alan, I'm not familiar with those ETFs.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.480]   I'm focusing on
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.520]   the Vanguard's, the Invesco's, the
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.280]   that's another one.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.680]   I found a couple.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.640]   Franklin Templeton, I look for international,
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.320]   but I'm not familiar with Avantis.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.720]   I'd have to look that up myself.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.240]   And I don't and I don't know the Dimensional Funds.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.800]   I think they were based on.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.080]   Different types of strategies that I never paid attention to.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.320]   Yeah, they were interesting.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.680]   They start off mainly focusing on extreme small cap value,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.840]   maybe somewhere between micro and small cap, focusing on value.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.120]   And they're basically, I believe, following academic research
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.800]   coming out of University of Chicago and the Nobel laureates that
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.480]   that did that work that were consultants with them.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.160]   I don't know how they perform long term,
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.560]   but I think they're pretty highly regarded in the industry
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.360]   as a way to kind of have a more or less an index approach.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.320]   But with a little bit of an active tilt to it, that's still reasonably inexpensive.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.920]   I personally don't own any of the funds, so I haven't followed them.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.200]   Does anybody else own either
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.760]   dimensional or Avantis ETFs?
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.280]   Avantis, the guy who started Avantis broke away from dimensional.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.160]   I think he was maybe even a co-CEO because he wanted to introduce ETFs,
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.600]   which initially Dimensional did not want to.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.760]   Kind of like Bogle, just like Bogle didn't like ETFs.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.720]   But eventually now Dimensional has had to come out with ETFs
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.760]   to try to maintain their business.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.960]   But is anybody else using either of those funds?
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.520]   I don't even know how the active ETFs are doing.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.320]   I mean, do you pay attention?
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.200]   I mean, except for the only one I know is Cathie Wood, right?
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.520]   We all know how that's done.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.040]   By the way, Jay, your hand is still up.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.360]   Did you have another comment, Jitendra?
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.360]   Did you have another comment, Jitendra, your hand is still up.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.520]   Maybe not.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.520]   Greg, your hand is up.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.880]   OK, I'll persist here.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.040]   There's a few really good questions back about 5.44 p.m.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.480]   That's probably Pacific time.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.320]   So you might want to go back.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.600]   There's one from Steve that I was curious about, but I'll put in one of my own.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.560]   And that's Steve Fenn for himself.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.560]   Well, if you can read it for us.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.840]   Just read it, Greg.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.200]   All right. Well, I'll give you I'll give you a few here.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:49.200]   Which small index do you follow and why in choosing your own funds?
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:55.040]   That's the part A. Part B is do you tilt a small value or other factors?
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:00.400]   So I know that's a very good question.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.720]   I use the Vanguard. I use both.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.760]   I use the Vanguard growth and I use the Vanguard value.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:11.640]   I also have found this interesting ETF.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.760]   The ticker is PSCT, tell you the truth.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.400]   And the only reason why I use it is it's all small cap tech stocks
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:25.000]   and all of those tech stocks.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.360]   We own half of those in the portfolio.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.480]   So I called my tech analyst who still works for Eagle.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.280]   And I said, do you recognize this?
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.760]   Are we still and he's like, oh, this is this is a great.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.200]   He mentioned it as a great book.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.560]   Now, the net expense ratio is a little bit higher.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.760]   So I do do some specialized.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.880]   I have and that's one of them tech.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.640]   I do own a health care ETF and I'm not going to give you that one.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.760]   I actually have to look it up in small cap.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.840]   And then and what's the other small cap one that we've been using?
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.720]   I have to also look it up.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.120]   But I'll make sure that.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.800]   How much how much weight do you put into looking at the underlying index?
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:13.400]   I have. So in my equity, so in my equity portfolio right now,
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   I just looked at this, I have 66 percent.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:22.360]   I have. I believe I have 70 percent of that is towards large cap.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.480]   But that's just because the mega caps have done so well.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.400]   I am looking to readjust this.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.120]   I have 25 percent in mid cap and then the rest goes in small cap.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.160]   OK, I'll cut to the chase. Are you a factor believer?
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.840]   No, no. OK.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.320]   So total market approach at this point. Correct.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.440]   OK, I'd be glad to read a question from Steven who submitted this a while back.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.200]   This one is due. OK, thanks, Alan.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.120]   Knowing that you knowing what you know now about managing a portfolio
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:58.160]   in retirement, do you feel differently about the value of active investing
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.640]   during one's investing career?
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.040]   Are the potentially high gains in your active portfolio
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.920]   that would trigger taxes if you transition to a passive index
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.040]   portfolio worth it to most people?
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.560]   That's a good question.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.760]   So I know that we would
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.800]   in small cap, Greg or Steve, I should say.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.720]   Yeah, that's me. That's you.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.680]   That's a great question.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.720]   We did not have to worry about taxes as much as the large cap did.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:37.200]   And the reason being and the reason being is that our turnover.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.480]   Normally, we made sure that we matched some of our losses,
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.720]   our big losses with some of our big gains.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.720]   So I know that tax at the end of the year for the mutual funds or whatever,
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.760]   or even even the SMAs could end up as a huge tax bill for some of the investors.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.800]   I know for our actively managed, I'm sure there's many active managers
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.000]   who are now looking at this because that's one of the number one complaints
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.760]   is at the end of the year, they couldn't control their taxes.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:08.720]   So either you owned us in a tax deferred product, which we would sell,
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.360]   or if you owned us in a taxable product that we would kind of monitor
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.960]   that tax situation. It was, again, much easier in small cap
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:20.200]   than it is in large cap. And would I recommend a.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.320]   I don't think knowing what I know now.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.200]   And because I have many friends in large cap,
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:33.560]   I would not recommend an actively managed large cap that just focuses on S&P 500.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.280]   It's just too hard. It's it's I don't know.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.720]   I just found the returns minimal in small cap.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.800]   It's a different story and it would depend on the manager.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.720]   And then I asked that question because I'm I'm early in my retirement
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.080]   and I I don't know, maybe 14 years ago or so
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.040]   is when I learned about Bogleheads and I was like, oh, index.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.840]   OK. And from that time on.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.640]   Yeah, I was all indexed.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:07.160]   But I and I I managed to pare down some of my more active stuff.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.560]   But still, I wish I had gotten it all.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.760]   And and in retrospect, I'm like, gosh, you know, kind of wish maybe I hadn't.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.120]   That wasn't optimal, but all right.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.240]   I am where I am, you know, so I was like.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.960]   That's that was that was the motivation and your your
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:26.120]   your presentation, which was wonderful, is talking about how do you evaluate active?
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.400]   Oh, this is good.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.000]   We take it very seriously.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.200]   We look at the management and we look at the numbers and,
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.640]   you know, all that kind of stuff was like, that's true.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.080]   But you reach you then get to a point in your life
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   where you're like, oh, I don't want to deal with this anymore.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.840]   Yeah. Anyway, that was sort of the motivation of my question.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.720]   Thank you for your response.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.160]   It's a great question. Thank you, lady.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.200]   I'll get to you in a moment.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.960]   I want to put a question, Betsy, because you're talking about this.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.720]   Did you guys know as managers what percentage of the holdings
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.400]   or the individuals or institutional versus the
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.240]   the individual investor that held your fund,
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.680]   what the breakdown was between the two?
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.200]   Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.680]   We had software that we could tell actually
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.760]   who was trading our stock by the end of the day.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.440]   So, for instance, if Fidelity owned a big portion of one of our stocks,
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.520]   we knew it because of the movement in the stock or just where we
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.160]   or what we would see on earnings.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.520]   And I'll tell you right now, I would say in our companies.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:34.200]   We hardly saw movements from the individual investor.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.880]   It was mostly the institutional.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.120]   And I'll tell you right now, it was Artisan.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.160]   It was Wasatch. It was.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.680]   It was it was it was it was some of the big T-Rows.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.880]   You know, just any of the big ones that you see out there.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.760]   We could tell who was moving the stock.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.920]   But you didn't change anything based upon whether it was predominantly
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.840]   institutionally owned versus the individual investor.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.880]   I presume most of it was maybe institutional or separately managed
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.000]   account through, say, a Raymond James or other, you know, advisor.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.720]   I'll tell you right now, I never paid attention to the individual investor.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.280]   I always paid attention to the smart money.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.800]   And but but the smart money gets it wrong, too.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.800]   But I really paid attention if there was seven of my peers
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.560]   all in this one company that I never recognized before.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.680]   That track kind of drove me to do analysis on that company.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.120]   Interesting. Thank you.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.000]   OK, Lady Geek. Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.040]   This discussion reminds me of Gus Salter many years, several years ago
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.240]   when he was at the Philadelphia Bogle Heads Conference,
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:45.800]   when Gus was running the fund, you know, he was like Jack Bogle's right hand man.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.720]   I remember speaking with him directly and he or at least with the audience,
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.440]   he gave a very interesting talk on how the fund managers
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:00.680]   keep track, keep on track with the indices like the S&P 500.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.120]   He would say every day they would go and they have morning
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.840]   they would have all these meetings.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:09.200]   And you had to have the sharpest people who did this on a daily basis.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:13.400]   How the heck did they keep that fund tracking within like point zero
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.520]   zero one percent of the index?
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.720]   It is a very difficult job.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.160]   It is almost like an art to doing that.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.800]   So I just it just this discussion reminds me of speaking with Gus Salter.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:28.960]   And he people who know him, at least from seeing him at the conference
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.640]   every year, the guy is like phenomenal in terms of theoretical and math and stuff.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.400]   This is his this is his love, I believe.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:41.600]   But he just kept saying how difficult they really, really had to manage
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.000]   the fund, the guys who did the trades, how they tracked every index.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.320]   And it was it was really amazing how well they did that.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.480]   So you keep talking about buying an active and passive.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:56.960]   That completely masks the underlying details of how this stuff actually happens.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.360]   It actually boils down to people and algorithms.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.200]   So that's why I wanted to make that point.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.080]   Well, Lady Geek, I'll tell you, we had an advantage
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   being an active manager.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.520]   We would actually watch and we would try to play games,
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.520]   play games on end of quarter.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:15.200]   And this was early in my career because we weren't allowed to do it
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.240]   by SEC rules at the end.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:21.160]   But we knew that Vanguard had to have so much percentage in certain names.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.560]   So when they started their small cap,
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.720]   we would buy these companies that had very low liquidity.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.800]   And we would know that we would push it up a certain percentage.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.400]   And Vanguard on that Monday, we do it like on a Friday.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.680]   On that Monday, we would see that stock rise by six to 10 percent.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.720]   And we would sell immediately because we knew Vanguard
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   had to have that closeness to the index.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.080]   But you know what? Vanguard got smart about it, too.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.760]   They would watch those positions and they would keep an eye on it.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:54.200]   And now you know that they can kind of have a time frame
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.440]   before they actually actively push that passive position.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.280]   So it is very interesting.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.600]   But there is software that you that we could buy
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.320]   that could tell us what Vanguard was doing.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.120]   Yeah. Isn't it called front running?
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.840]   Is that called front running?
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   Well, you front run if you're a man, if you're personally doing it.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.800]   But if you're doing it as a fund manager, I'm running your money.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.600]   I'm doing I'm doing what's best for the client.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.960]   So I could do it all day long and not get in trouble.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.800]   Again, the SEC rules have changed since that time.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.280]   But Vanguard has become this behemoth.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.280]   So whenever they started becoming a passive manager
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.280]   for one of our one of our indexes, we loved it.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.200]   And I think front.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.440]   I think front running implies really illegal.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.480]   You know, information with you definitely know information,
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.480]   before you're supposed to know it.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.880]   Whereas what she was talking about is you kind of suspected
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.440]   that was going to happen, right?
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.000]   Because you'd seen it happen a lot of times.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.960]   So you kind of anticipated it.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.680]   But you didn't 100 percent know it was going to happen.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.320]   Right now. Right.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.360]   Well, that being said, right, we could never buy a company
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.360]   that was outside of our investment process.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:15.240]   You wouldn't see me buy a biotech company that had no earnings.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.000]   That just wasn't part of our.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.440]   But there was ways of watching it.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.800]   It is ways of watching to make sure that you could still get a good return
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.520]   off the stock, you know, even if Vanguard didn't participate.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:30.440]   But it is interesting.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.320]   Yeah. Yeah. The street has to make money somehow.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.360]   Everybody's going to pass it.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.720]   There's a book that was written that described front running
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.960]   called something like Flash Boys or something.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.200]   It has the word flash in it.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.400]   Fascinating book from a number of years back.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.160]   I love those.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.920]   It was about laying this fiber optic in the most optimal way
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.680]   so that they could get like a multi millisecond advantage to to what was going.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.560]   Yeah, that was a high frequency, the high frequency traders that had the computers,
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.000]   the closer they were with their mainframe.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.040]   Yes. Wall Street.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.480]   Milliseconds. That's right.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.800]   It was all. It was all speed of light.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.280]   It was like, how much can we optimize this?
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.600]   Yes. They didn't want the fiber bent. It was.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.600]   It was intriguing.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.320]   And eventually, I mean, I think the book was made five,
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.120]   six, seven years ago, something like that.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.680]   I think the SEC came up with some new regulations
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:31.120]   that they had to all route everything through a common source.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.080]   I think a common computer or something.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.760]   Yeah. Even out the playing field.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.760]   They eliminated that from some regulation.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.200]   It sort of slowed it down a little. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.720]   Well, I'll tell you, though, the last big event or cool.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.240]   Well, not cool or neat.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:49.280]   Neato kind of thing that happened with me was watching that GameStop
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.280]   because I actually did it.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.800]   We actually our poor consumer analysts had dumb money.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.120]   It's gone. Have you guys seen that movie?
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.800]   That's it's called some money. You better watch it.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.680]   It's all on the GameStop.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:06.280]   And it's fascinating to see what the little little investor could do
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.360]   to those who have heavily shorted a terrible company.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.360]   It was a terrible. We were not invested.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.560]   But we kept monitoring it every day. It was it was fascinating.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.440]   Yeah. And very interesting.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.600]   Yeah, I'm curious, I know you said you're I don't know if you're
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:24.080]   your children, adult children are on this zoom at all, Betsy,
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.200]   but I'm just curious without I'm not putting them on the spot.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.240]   But when you have conversations with your children,
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.320]   as all of us that have children and now we're retired and they're in
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.840]   they're approaching hopefully their peak earning years.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.680]   It's been interesting in trying to have financial discussions
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.160]   and having an opportunity to share our values and teach them,
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.400]   which for me personally has been slow going.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.920]   I'm just curious how the two of you approach that with your kids.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:53.640]   Well, we were we were one of our kids followed me into the business.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.160]   So he actually he fought he he works for a hedge fund in New York City
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.680]   and he has a total different mandate.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.520]   So it was funny, though.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:06.640]   I worked I was work from home before work from home became popular.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.280]   I've been doing it for 20 years since Chris and I were based in Florida
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.880]   and my company was my my team was based in Vermont.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.720]   So he actually had access to all of the tools
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.200]   and he would come in and play a little bit, but he didn't get serious.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.840]   And so he he went to went to college at Cornell
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.560]   and he learned all the ropes and he would now every day
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.760]   we talk about or there was a time where our careers overlapped.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.080]   And so he's he's definitely fully involved
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.960]   and and believes in the passive investment, but he's an active.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.200]   His mandate is totally different than what mine was.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.120]   And his brain is so much smarter.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.640]   Our daughter. Wait, wait, wait.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.800]   So to answer your question a little bit to
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.480]   my perspective as a civil engineer,
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.080]   I've I tried to get him to get into engineering.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.280]   And luckily, I think I think at the end of the day,
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.800]   he'll be glad that he did that.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.000]   So he got a degree in engineering
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.160]   and he's he ended up on Wall Street with those guys.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.400]   And then I don't our daughter, like like you just said, she's a tricky one.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:20.040]   I try to send her those very few articles
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.200]   every week on what you should do with your money.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.480]   I started a Roth with her way back when she first started earning money.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.440]   But she's a she's a tough one
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.000]   because her whole passion is art.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.680]   And she's not afraid to spend money, even at her age.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.800]   So she'll have no problem.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:45.400]   Like we all have trouble spending money, but for whatever reason, she does.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:52.040]   Now, it's it's interesting that the two biggest challenges
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.360]   I've personally encountered in retirement is, as with you, spending the money,
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.560]   opening up the purse strings, very, very difficult after a life
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.760]   of more or less living way below my means.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.680]   And then also trying to educate the next generation,
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.440]   our children and their friends and so forth and and observing what's going on.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.920]   I'm glad to see there's an active there's also a vocal head subreddit
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.720]   that's active amongst the millennials and younger generation.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.600]   And it's nice to see.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.560]   But again, we're for the most part, the tip of the iceberg, I think.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.720]   I think worldwide or certainly domestically,
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.800]   I think probably less than five percent of individual investors
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.720]   are pursuing a passive approach.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.280]   Everybody's chasing the almighty dollar and the GameStops and the Bitcoin
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.960]   and whatnot. So it's interesting.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.280]   Well, I mean, you see a stock like NVIDIA.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.440]   I think it's, again, up like something's crazy, like 200 percent.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.720]   There's one of those. That's all it takes.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:52.120]   Yeah. Interesting.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.320]   But just do we have but even going back to your other part
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.480]   and the simple stuff like matching out your 401k as soon as you can
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.400]   and, you know, getting, you know, getting in that mindset, you know,
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.000]   and and they're both picking up on it.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.520]   But it's it's it's a process for sure.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.080]   And education, you know.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.360]   Yeah, I was very happy.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.840]   This is a couple of years ago when the crypto craze first started.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.640]   My daughter, who lives in New York, was telling me, you know,
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.360]   she asked me about crypto and I advised against it.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.440]   But she said all her friends are buying it.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.480]   And she did not.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.080]   She she picked up a little bit of what I said over the years,
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.600]   but it really made my heart go pitter patter when she said, I know, dad,
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.640]   just buy and hold.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.000]   It's time in the market, not timing the market.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.720]   And that made my day.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.960]   I said, my life is complete.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.840]   I've been self-actualized.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.440]   Wow. That's great.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.200]   Yeah, but Bitcoin's at 76,000 now.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:55.960]   So, yeah, it's well, the ETFs, all those ETFs now, everybody's piling into it.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.560]   We'll see how long it lasts. That's right.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:02.960]   Do we have more questions, folks,
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.480]   if anybody wants to raise their hand or submit it in the chat?
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.800]   I got one question about
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.200]   was Betsy and active managers in general aware of what Steve?
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.960]   We're at what the Steve report.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.480]   I lost it. Oh, I think I just saw this.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:28.920]   Yeah. How active managers lose to the index every every year.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.840]   I'm aware of it. No, I don't read it.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:38.640]   Yeah, that's that's interesting, because, yeah, those that do outperform
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:43.800]   for the first early years don't have persistence for the most part.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.720]   Not saying that you didn't.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:51.320]   But and certainly the small cap space has been easier to outperform the index.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:56.760]   But as a general rule, I think now the speed of folks, which is the S&P
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:02.360]   people actually do an analysis as well called persistence.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.440]   Those that do outperform, do they persist in their outperformance?
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.640]   And as expected, no, long term, they generally don't.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.440]   And those that do, you have to be able to pick those managers in advance
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.800]   in order to do really well and continue to outperform.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.280]   But we don't have any thing to guide us
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.760]   and being able to pick them in advance, other than pure luck,
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:26.000]   because they don't have a track record yet at that point.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   Yeah. Interesting.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.880]   Yeah, it was funny to watch us go from two hundred million to three billion.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:38.600]   And it's because we became the hot little thing on the market.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:42.360]   And it was amazing how much money rolls in when it rolls in very quickly.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:46.520]   Did you have to close your fund at all in order to limit?
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.880]   We did. And I'll tell you the truth.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.120]   We closed it at two point two billion, I think.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.640]   And the salespeople kept selling us.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:59.720]   So we finally put a hard you end up doing a soft close at two point two.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.360]   And then we did a hard close at three billion, because at that point
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.120]   we had kind of filled all the positions.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.880]   We didn't we can take any more money.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.920]   Mm hmm. Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.800]   In fact, the podcast I mentioned, the the long view on morning
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.600]   with Morningstar with that small cap manager this week talks about that,
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:21.040]   how often they have to close their their actively managed funds
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.400]   because they just couldn't purchase anymore.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.480]   They basically they had done everything they could and they had too much money
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:28.480]   coming in. Right, right.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.600]   And then I guess and the tough space is the microcap.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:35.000]   I think the microcap and that and that's why you don't see a lot of
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.640]   actively run microcaps by the brokerage houses,
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.640]   because they don't make any money off.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:44.880]   You can't you can't charge because it's that much work
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.120]   to put into these microcaps before you can actually put a portfolio together.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.840]   And then you have to immediately close it when it hits like a billion.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:56.160]   Yeah, it's very interesting.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:02.120]   I think you sold us on the viability.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.720]   If you really want to work hard and perhaps outperforming
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.960]   and picking as being a stock picker.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.680]   But I think for most of us, whether you're a true Vogelhead
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.080]   or more or less embracing the philosophy that
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:17.640]   the index approach is probably ideal for the majority of us.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:22.000]   And I think most of us, certainly myself, got
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.920]   I got my start trying to individually pick stocks.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:30.280]   And going way back, gosh, probably about 30 years ago,
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:33.160]   I had a girlfriend who was actually a day trader.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.080]   And she I live in Tampa.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.480]   She was in Orlando.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.640]   And there was a small, very small, unknown company.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:42.440]   She found a chip maker called Sawtech.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.160]   They were relatively unknown.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:44.720]   And we toured.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.760]   We went in and met with the management and tour their setup there,
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.920]   which was incredible.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.640]   And I invested in them.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.080]   I was very impressed.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.160]   And they were it went nowhere.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.440]   And I ultimately lost some.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.760]   I sold it at a loss, not a big loss.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.640]   But I realized at that point and unfortunately, it took me a while
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:08.280]   beyond that to realize that just sticking to an index would be the approach.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.600]   But I probably carried on with stock picking for another three, four years
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.880]   before I finally threw in the towel.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.520]   Well, Alan, to that point, I mean, I don't know how many different ideas
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:25.360]   and, you know, ideas for companies that have come along
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:28.760]   now that we're older and we're seeing these things, you know,
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.640]   and you got kids making an app and, you know,
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:36.200]   what else sound like really great ideas, you know, but
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:40.600]   it takes a lot to make it actually go and make it work. Yeah.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:44.880]   Well, as Jack Bogle was fond of saying is instead of trying to pick out
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.640]   the needle in the haystack, just buy the whole haystack.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.840]   Exactly.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.800]   Sounds good.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.840]   That pretty much sums it up.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.840]   Yeah. All right, folks.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.560]   Any I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.640]   No. Any further comments or questions?
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.200]   Anybody?
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:10.920]   OK, if not, I guess we'll we'll wrap it up again.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:15.200]   I want to thank Betsy and Chris for a very unique
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:20.000]   shared perspective about how the sausage is made in active management.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.320]   And you're a rare breed to have admitted and been honest
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.080]   about the utility of switching to a more passive approach.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.920]   Look forward to hearing your further perspectives.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:33.000]   Our local Tampa Bay chapter meetings.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.960]   I encourage everybody to check the Boglehead calendar of events.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.760]   Also, check out all the four life stage chapters that meet virtually on Zoom,
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.440]   as well as any Boglehead local chapters in your community or start one
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.680]   if you don't have one nearby and continue to come up with ideas.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:58.240]   And and we'll keep the all these conversations and share perspectives going.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.960]   I want to do a quick launch a poll real quick.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.760]   The final poll, for those of you still here,
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:07.920]   just to get some feedback on what you thought of this meeting.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:08.920]   So bear with me, folks.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.160]   I'm just going to do one more quick poll here,
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.280]   if you don't mind answering this just for our feedback.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:27.360]   Obviously, the people that I board already signed off,
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.160]   so we expect to have a good response here.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:35.120]   That's right, wait till the bitter end, it's skewed.
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:40.520]   Yeah, you must be one of those active managers.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.920]   Numbers.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:48.360]   All righty, everybody, I'll go ahead and share this.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.840]   Waiting for the end of the quarter to actually.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.880]   All right.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.560]   Yeah, so all the people who didn't care for it are are long gone.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.280]   But again, that was wonderful.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:03.480]   Betsy and Chris, everybody, thanks for sticking with us.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:08.440]   If anybody wants to save the chat before I end this, if you go down to the chat,
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.920]   you'll see there's an ellipsis, the three dots, and you can go save chat.
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:15.160]   It'll save it to your local computer.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.320]   Lady Geek typically saves the chat and anonymizes it
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.720]   and posts a link on the Bogleheads forum.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:23.520]   So you can also get it from there.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.440]   I didn't have a chance.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.000]   It's very hard when you're hosting to look at all the all the comments
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.680]   in the chat going by, they go by too quick.
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.960]   But again, thanks, everybody, for attending.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.000]   Hope this was useful.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.960]   And maybe, Betsy, you can drag Chris along to our next in-person
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.120]   Tampa Bay chapter meeting.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.400]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.160]   Thanks again.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:38:04.000]   [MUSIC]
