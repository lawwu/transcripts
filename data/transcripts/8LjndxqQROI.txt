[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   We come this evening to a consideration of the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:17.840]   and the section that begins at verse 21 and goes on to the end of the chapter, namely to verse 31.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:27.320]   I'm not going to read the entire passage to you, but it begins with these words, "But now the
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.280]   righteousness of God without the law is manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.680]   even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.840]   believe. For there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God," and so
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:01.600]   on. Now here we are starting on a new section of this great epistle. You will remember that when
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.200]   we began the consideration of this third chapter, I indicated that it can obviously be divided very
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.120]   conveniently into three sections. The first section running from the first verse to the end of the
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.320]   eighth verse, and then we had the section of quotations and so on beginning at verse 9 and
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.160]   going on to the end of verse 20, and then we come to this third section. So that as we start with
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.920]   this twenty-first verse, we are starting on a new section in two senses. One is that it's a new
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.800]   section of the third chapter, but still more important, and indeed altogether more important,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:58.320]   it is the beginning of one of the major sections of the whole epistle, because verse 20, as we saw,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.800]   ended a section which began right away back in the first chapter. You can say, if you like,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.760]   at the eighteenth verse of the first chapter, indeed you can almost say the sixteenth verse
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.400]   of the first chapter. But perhaps for the sake of having the thing clearly in our mind, it is still
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.560]   wise to regard verses 16 and 17 in the first chapter as the statement of the gospel, and why
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.520]   the apostle was so glad and proud of it, and glad to preach it. And then, starting at verse 18 in
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.000]   the first chapter, is this tremendous statement about the wrath of God which has been revealed.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.760]   Then you remember he goes on to prove that this is as applicable to the Jews as it is to the
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.120]   Gentiles. And so he's worked it all out, and therefore he ends at verse 20 in this third
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.840]   chapter by saying, "Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.680]   for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Very well. He has established it beyond any question
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   or doubt or cavil that no man ever has or ever will be able to justify himself in the presence
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:28.880]   of God. No man ever has or ever will provide a righteousness that will satisfy God and the
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.640]   demands of his most holy law. That's clear, that's definite. He's proved it from every conceivable
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:46.680]   angle. Very well. Having established that, he now goes on to show how there is only one way
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.720]   of salvation, therefore. But thank God there is one. As we left it at the end of the 20th verse
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.360]   in this third chapter, we saw ourselves in a completely hopeless position. And that, may I
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.680]   say, is something that is always essential. I cannot see how a man can be a Christian without
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.360]   realizing his own utter hopelessness. It's no use talking about coming to Christ if you don't see
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.240]   your hopelessness and your helplessness. You can't just come to him for help or something.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.160]   There is but one reason for going to Christ, and that is that you realize that no flesh can
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:38.800]   possibly be justified by the law in the sight of God. Every mouth has been stopped, and the whole
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.200]   world lieth guilty before God. Very well, there it was. So that having come to that point, the
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.160]   question we ask obviously is, well, is there no hope for us? Can nothing be done for us? Are we
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:04.400]   irreprovably doomed? And now the apostle goes on to answer the question. And he does so, you
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:16.280]   notice, by two words, two little words. And here they are, "but now." Now, there are no more vital
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:25.880]   words in the whole of the scripture than just these two words, "but now." What vital words
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:37.840]   these are? These are the kind of words with which the apostle always introduces the gospel. It's
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.600]   something that you'll find constantly in the New Testament scriptures. He paints his dark and his
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.720]   black picture, and not only this apostle, but the others also in the same way. But particularly,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.280]   is this true of the apostle Paul and his particular style? He first of all paints his black and his
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:07.360]   dark and his hopeless picture. And then, having painted it, he says, "but now." It was because
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.920]   they also had understood this, that the Puritans and many of their successors until comparatively
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:23.440]   recently always taught that in true evangelism you must always start with a law work. They said
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:31.280]   there should always be a good law work before you introduce your gospel. You read the lives of some
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.720]   of the greatest evangelists that the world has ever known, and you'll find they all did that.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.480]   Not only the Puritans, but the men of the eighteenth century who leant so much upon the
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.800]   Puritans and who were so familiar with their works, they convicted first of all—and it's true of
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.920]   John Wesley as of George Whitefield, it's true of Jonathan Edwards, it's true of the saintly
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.800]   Robert Murray M'Chayne—these men always said you must start with a law work. And the apostle has
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:09.600]   been doing that. And it's only after he's done that that he says, "but now." And having been
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.800]   through that in great detail as we have, and having considered every statement that he makes
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.040]   about men under sin and in sin, all of us as we are by nature and as descendants of Adam,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:30.840]   can there be two words which are more blessed and more wonderful for us than just these two words?
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:40.360]   "But now." You know, I feel these two words are a very subtle and a very thoroughgoing
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:51.040]   test of our whole position as Christians. Would you like to know for certain at this moment whether
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.720]   you're a Christian or not? Well, I'm suggesting that this is the sort of test. As I say again,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:03.840]   these two words, "but now," is there something within you that makes you say, "Thank God"?
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   Is there a "but now" in your experience? Now, I chose that last hymn which we've been singing,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:21.160]   "Lord, I was blind, I could not see in thy mad visage any grace," because it keeps on bringing
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   that point. Did you notice it? In the third line of all the verses except the last, you had this,
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:36.680]   "but now." And he keeps on saying it. He couldn't stir his lifeless soul to come, "but now." "But
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:43.400]   now, but now," he keeps on saying it. Everything's changed. Why? Well, because the gospel has come
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:53.360]   to him. He was dead, he was blind, he was dumb. "But now." He's no longer like that. So that,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:00.400]   I say this comes to us in a kind of dual manner. It comes as the introduction of the gospel,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:08.520]   but of necessity, therefore, it comes as a word that tests us ourselves. This, to me,
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.400]   is so important that I can't leave it. I must stay with it for just another second. Tell me,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:21.640]   let's examine our experiences. When the devil attacks you and suggests to you that you're
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.960]   not a Christian and that you've never been a Christian because of what's still in your heart,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.120]   or because of what you're still doing, or because of something you once did, when he comes and thus
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:40.920]   accuses you, what do you say to him? Do you agree with him? Or do you say to him, "Yes,
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:50.080]   that was true, but now." Do you hold up these words against him? Or when it is that perhaps
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   you feel condemned as you read the scriptures, as you read the law in the Old Testament,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.760]   as you read the Sermon on the Mount, and as you feel that you're absolutely undone,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:08.520]   do you just remain there, or do you lift up your head and say, "But now." This is the
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:15.760]   essence of the Christian position. This is how faith speaks to the accusations of the devil,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   the accusations of the law, to the accusations of conscience, and to everything else. This
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:33.040]   "but." This "but now." So that you see, these are indeed very wonderful words, and it's most
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.760]   important that we should lay hold upon them and realize their tremendous importance and
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.720]   their real significance. There is an aspect of faith of which it is true to say this,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:56.320]   that faith is a kind of protest. All these things are against us. Very well, are you
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.800]   a man of faith or not? Well, this is just the question, and the way you answer it is
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:09.000]   this. Having listened to all that can be said, do you then say, "But now." Now that is a
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.800]   part of the fight of faith. Don't imagine that as a Christian you're going to be immune
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:22.120]   to the assaults of Satan or to attacks of doubt. They may well come, but the whole secret
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:29.000]   of faith is the ability, I say, to stand up with these two words against it all. We walk
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.960]   by faith and not by sight. There is a sense, then, I'm saying, in which what Browning,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.160]   I think it was, said about faith is true. It isn't the whole statement about faith,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:49.720]   but there is this aspect in it. To me, he said, "Faith means unbelief kept quiet like
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:56.520]   the snake 'neath Michael's foot." You see, he's got a comparison. This man Michael is
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.320]   standing there, and he's got his foot on the head of a snake. And this snake is wriggling,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.680]   and he's trying to get at him in order to bite him. But as long as the man keeps his
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.360]   pressure firm upon the neck of that snake, he can't do anything. There is all the wriggling
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.920]   of doubt and unbelief and denial and all these accusations. Then faith keeps its foot firmly
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:29.560]   down and says, "But now." Now, I'm just putting it that way. The kind of thing, of course,
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.600]   that Martin Luther never stopped saying from the moment he really saw this truth of justification
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:43.960]   by faith only. That is really a kind of synopsis of the whole of his great preaching and all
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   his great teaching. That is exactly what faith does. It's this protest. It's this standing
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:58.000]   up in spite of everything that may be said in hell and all around us on earth against
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.680]   us. We say, "No, no. No one can finally convict me because of my new position in Christ Jesus.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.880]   But now, I'm no longer there. I was there, but I'm no longer there."
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:22.840]   Very well, then let me leave this by just asking a question once more. Do you see that
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:31.200]   you stand by faith? It would be a tragedy for us to go on if somebody still is holding
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.840]   on to any sort of idea that you can ever make yourself a Christian or that by living a better
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.160]   life or doing this or that or the other, you're going to improve your position in the sight
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.600]   of God. Has it become clear to everybody that it doesn't matter if you were to live as
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:54.040]   old as Methuselah or even a million years, you'd never put yourself right before God?
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.800]   Time won't help you. Nothing will help you. We are all of us under condemnation. We are
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:05.600]   all under the wrath of God. We can never produce a righteousness that can stand up to God's
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:13.200]   scan and examination and investigation. We are all together hopeless. Are we all clear
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   about that? Very well. If you are, you are ready to rejoice in these two words, "but
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.400]   now." Very well, what is their meaning? Well, now they do two main things, it seems
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   to me. First and foremost, they provide us with a contrast with all that the apostle
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   has been saying before. A contrast, if you like, to all that old law position, to that
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:50.000]   being under the law in any shape or form. It's a contrast to that. But in addition to
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.880]   that, of course, the "but now" does bring in the time factor. Because what he's really
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.400]   saying is this, "But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested." And
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.320]   it's only just been manifested, says Paul. Here is a man, you see, preaching within a
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.560]   comparatively short time, after everything that is associated with the name of the Lord
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.800]   Jesus Christ, his incarnation, his life, his death, his resurrection, his everything. And
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:23.880]   he says, "Now, this thing that has happened has changed everything." And he goes on to
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:31.200]   tell them about it. Something had happened, he reminds these Romans, which is absolutely
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:40.520]   new and which is the most amazing good news that has ever come to a sinful race of men.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.520]   And that is why, you see, so far back in that first chapter he said, "I am not ashamed of
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:52.520]   the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:58.440]   For therein a righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.360]   just by faith shall live.'" Now, you see, the apostle can't think of the thing without
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.480]   being thrilled to the very marrow of his being. And he's longing to be in Rome to tell them
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:17.080]   all about it and to enjoy it with them again. And it's all, I say, because of this. This
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:24.640]   tremendous thing has happened. It took him a long time to see it and to believe it. He
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.120]   had to pass through that experience on the road to Damascus. He had to see the written
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:36.320]   Lord. But once he'd seen him, and once he'd understood, everything else became nothing.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.560]   Dung and refuse was all his righteousness. Everything recedes into insignificance. This
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.440]   is the one thing that matters.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.520]   Very well then, I say, let us look at this wonderful thing which is now about to unfold
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:17:00.680]   to these Romans, this wonderful good news. He gives us again a great summary of it, as
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:07.320]   I say, in these verses, from verse 21 to verse 31. Now, I felt it would be a good thing for
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:12.440]   me to give you a general analysis of this great statement before we come to look at
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:18.920]   its particular elements. Because it's such a great passage that it's possible for us
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.720]   to read through it and to say, "Well, it sounds very wonderful, but I'm not quite sure what
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.040]   it's saying and what its exact meaning is." Now, let me suggest to you an analysis. There
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.720]   are a number of analyses I could hold before you, but that perhaps would be confusing.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.680]   Let me suggest to you the analysis which commends itself best to me. This is my analysis of
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:49.040]   it at Ennuret. I would divide the section into two main portions, two main statements.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:59.680]   I suggest that from verse 21 to the end of verse 24, he describes the way of salvation.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:06.400]   And then from verse 25 to the end, he tells us about the characteristics of that way of
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:12.000]   salvation. Now, both these aspects are very important. Let's divide it further for you
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.040]   in this way. The first section, verses 21 to 24, is a description of the way of salvation.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:27.600]   What does he say? Well, the first thing he says is this, "God has provided a righteousness
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.000]   and has now revealed it. He had promised it before, but he has now made it manifest."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:44.240]   God has provided it. The second thing is this, "This righteousness becomes ours, not by
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:53.160]   any means as the result of our actions or our conformity to any kind of law, but solely
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:59.680]   and entirely through faith." That's the second thing. The third thing is that it is
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:06.160]   open to all. "For all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God." It's
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.200]   as open to the Gentiles as to the Jews. You see, the apostle all along has got this great
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.560]   argument that he's just finished in his mind. He's there been dealing with it negatively,
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.040]   he's now dealing with it positively. It's the same for all. It's open to all, Jews
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:28.760]   and Gentiles, no difference. Then the next point he makes is, the fourth point is, that
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:39.040]   it is entirely of God's grace. It's a free gift of God. And then the last point, and
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:46.680]   the most important in many ways, is this, "It has been made possible and available
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:55.480]   through the redeeming work of the Lord Jesus Christ." There's our first section. What
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:02.240]   a tremendous statement it is. There is the essence of the gospel. There it is stated
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:09.840]   very generally. And you needn't add anything to that, it's all there. We'll come back
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.720]   to it again in detail, but let me give you a kind of analysis also of the second subsection,
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:23.800]   the characteristics of this great salvation, described from verse 25 to verse 31. Here's
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:33.880]   the first point. "This is a way of salvation which is consistent with God's character."
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:41.200]   I want to repeat that. "It is a way of salvation that is consistent with God's character."
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:51.320]   That's verses 25 and 26. "It is a way that gives all the glory to God and none to men."
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:21:00.480]   Those are verses 27 and 28. "All the glory goes to God and none to men." Thirdly, "It
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.200]   is a way that shows that God is the God of the whole world and not only of a section
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.120]   of mankind." He's not only the God of the Jews, but of the Gentiles also. He is the
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.640]   God of the whole world, so the righteousness that he has provided is in the same way open
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:28.120]   to the whole world. There you have verses 29 and 30. And the last thing he tells us
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:38.360]   about it is this, "That it is a way that honors and confirms the law." This is one
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:44.360]   of the most amazing statements that even this great apostle ever made. You notice that all
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.320]   along he's still got his eye on the section which he's just been leaving. Negative there,
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.000]   positive here, but he deals with it point by point, nails and absolutely fixes it and
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.040]   settles it once and forever. And that's his final point. He is not deriding the law
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:07.560]   of God, he is establishing it. He's paying it the greatest compliment, in a sense. All
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   along, you see, he safeguards his statements. Well now, there is the general analysis of
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:23.400]   the section. It is no exaggeration to say of this section that it is one of the greatest
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:34.760]   and one of the most important sections in the whole of Scripture. I therefore go on
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:46.360]   to say this, that our ideas of salvation must always be true to this section. Whatever our
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:54.480]   views of salvation, they must always be conformable to this. And in the same way, we must never
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:02.760]   state the way of salvation in any way that denies any of these tests or that fails to
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:11.040]   satisfy and to give due weight to any one of these tests. You notice that I'm emphasizing
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:19.000]   these things, and I'm doing so because of the situation in which we find ourselves today.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:28.120]   It seems to me that we are in far too great a hurry to rush people anyhow somehow to Christ.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:34.040]   We are so anxious to get results, but we are to be governed in our methods as well as in
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:41.640]   our message by this Word of God. This is the statement of God's way of salvation, and
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:48.240]   it must be ours. We must leave nothing out, or anything we may say must come up to these
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:55.440]   tests. We mustn't say less, we mustn't say more, but we must say this. Here, then,
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.640]   I say, is the great standard, especially for all evangelists. Our message must be conformable
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.120]   to this. "Ah, but you say that won't appeal to people today, they're not interested in
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:13.200]   theology." My dear friend, they must be interested in theology if they are to become Christians.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.960]   They must hear the truth and must believe it. Men have never been interested in theology,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.920]   and never will be until the Holy Spirit deals with them. So our business is to preach the
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.480]   truth to them, trusting to the Holy Spirit to open their eyes and understanding, and
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:37.280]   to apply it and to bring it to them with power. Here, then, I say, is one of these crucial
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.680]   passages which governs, indeed, the whole of our preaching. We must always be within
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.360]   the bounds of this tremendous statement which we have here.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.020]   Very well, now let's go on and begin to look at it in detail. Take this first section,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:25:01.000]   The Way of Salvation. I don't know whether you feel as I do as you read this, Apostle
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:11.560]   Paul. His mind and his way of doing things fascinates me more and more, and I am tremendously
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:17.840]   interested in the way in which he introduces this great section, this great statement.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.280]   His way of doing it is to almost repeat word for word what he said at the very beginning
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:29.400]   of his epistle. Go back to verses 1 and 2 of the first chapter. Paul, a servant of Jesus
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:37.480]   Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God which he had promised
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:44.800]   afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:51.000]   which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, etc. It is almost an exact repetition
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:00.320]   of this. And in the same way, of course, he is virtually going back and saying once more
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:10.120]   what he said in verses 16 and 17 also of that first chapter.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.880]   There are always lessons to be learned as you watch a master like this, and one of the
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:22.440]   lessons which we must of necessity learn at this point, therefore, is this one, that we
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:29.720]   must have a kind of scheme in our presentation of the truth. This man does not write at random.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:37.080]   He does not just say the next thing that comes into his mind. No, he is establishing a case.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:42.560]   He has his general introduction. He announces his gospel. Then he shows the absolute necessity
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.480]   for it. Then having done that, he comes back to it, and now he is going to go on with it.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.600]   So as it were, he is saying, as I told you at the very beginning, I am now going to put
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.520]   it before you in greater detail.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.880]   Well, now what are the cardinal points, therefore, that he impresses? Here they are. Here is
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:09.200]   the first. The gospel is entirely God's. But now, the righteousness of God without
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.040]   the law is manifest. And do you remember that we saw way back there in chapter one, what
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.720]   we will have to look into in greater detail now, that the term the righteousness of God
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:26.680]   means a righteousness provided by God, a righteousness prepared by God, a righteousness that is made
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:34.960]   available by God. Therefore, I say that the gospel is entirely God's.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.160]   You notice that he actually used that phrase in the first verse of the epistle, "Paul,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:47.440]   a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God."
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.800]   You would have expected there, wouldn't you, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, but Paul
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.880]   says the gospel of God.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.680]   Now I want to suggest to you that this kind of thing isn't accidental, that it is something
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:07.480]   that the apostle always says and always does. And I'm calling your attention to it because
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:18.320]   of the tendency today, which is so evident, of almost leaving out God altogether, and
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:27.600]   of speaking only about and in terms of the Lord Jesus Christ. I've often called your
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.960]   attention to this. It's essential I should go on doing so because, as I am putting it
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:40.960]   to you, there seems to me to be this danger of forgetting almost the first person in the
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:48.840]   blessed Holy Trinity. In our evangelical zeal, we are so concentrating on the Son, the second
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:56.440]   person, as almost to ignore the Father. People seem to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ always,
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:06.040]   and it's about him they always speak. And so God the Father seems to be forgotten, neglected,
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:13.120]   and ignored. And surely it's a very terrible and a very serious thing. But here again we
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:19.160]   are reminded by the apostle that the gospel is God's gospel. God is the planner of this
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:26.360]   gospel. God is the initiator of this gospel. Indeed, you see, everything about the gospel
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:38.480]   should be always in terms of God primarily for this reason. Sin, after all, is rebellion
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.440]   against God. Sin isn't just something that means that you and I have failed and have
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.600]   let down ourselves and our standard. Sin isn't just something that makes me miserable and
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:30:00.640]   unhappy. The essence of sin is rebellion against God, estrangement from God. And if we don't
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:08.080]   conceive of sin always in terms of God, we've got an inadequate conception of sin. Very
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.200]   well, there is the starting point then of evangelism. There is the starting point of
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:20.840]   the gospel. Man is a rebel against God who is estranged from God. And our central need,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:28.680]   therefore, is to be reconciled to God. We don't merely come to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:37.080]   Our object is to come to God. That's what we need. As our sin is separation from him,
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.880]   sin is reconciliation to him. And then the next thing that is made so plain and clear
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:51.080]   is this, that it is God himself who provides this way. It is God who provides everything
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:31:00.720]   that is in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is God who sent him. It is God who gave him his task.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:07.560]   The whole thing is from God. It is God who so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:14.240]   Son. And yet I say there is this tendency to forget that and to leave it out, and to
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:21.440]   be so Christocentric, if you like, that we are guilty thus of forgetting and ignoring
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:28.640]   God the Father, the first person in the blessed Holy Trinity. And indeed, as that passage
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.400]   after the first epistle of Peter, which I read to you at the beginning, reminded us
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.360]   of so forcibly.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:47.120]   The whole object and intent of the work of the Lord Jesus Christ is to bring us to God.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:57.360]   We believe in God by him, says the apostle. And all he did was to bring us to God, not
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:04.160]   to glorify himself, but to glorify the Father, and to bring men to the Father. He does not
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:10.560]   tell us to stop at himself. He takes us to the Father, and he reconciles us to the Father.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:20.240]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. It is, you see, God's from beginning
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:27.920]   to end. And the apostle reminds us of that here. It is a God-provided righteousness that
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.840]   is now available for us.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:35.200]   Then the second thing is this, that it is something that has been planned in eternity
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:45.080]   before the very foundation of the world. He puts that in verse 22, and he says, "But
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.240]   now the righteousness of God without the law," in verse 21, "But now the righteousness of
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:57.880]   God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets."
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:04.560]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is not an afterthought. It is not something that God thought of when
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:10.720]   the law had failed to redeem men. How often is that taught? But we saw last Friday night
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:18.360]   that the law was never meant to save anybody. By the law is the knowledge of sin. So it
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:24.000]   is complete error to say that the law was first given an opportunity to save men, and
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.160]   when it failed, God then thought of the gospel and sent that. No, no, that is entirely wrong.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:38.680]   The gospel was planned before the foundation of the world, not an afterthought. And it
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.440]   was because God had planned it before the foundation of the world that he was able to
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:50.400]   reveal it in the law and in the prophets. That is why in your Old Testament you have
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.720]   got prophecies of the gospel, and all it was going to do. You have got it in the law, you
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.320]   have got it in the prophets. "Witnessed," says the apostle here, "by the law and by
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:06.280]   the prophets." What does he mean? Well, he is referring in the term "the law," obviously,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:12.640]   to the five books of Moses, the first five books of the Old Testament. I am not going
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:18.440]   to take you through the evidence; it would take us weeks. But you know some of the evidence,
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.720]   don't you? You get it in Genesis 3.15, with a promise about the seed of the woman that
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:30.040]   was to bruise the serpent's head. There it is, "witnessed to by the law." Some say they
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.560]   find it in the story of Cain and Abel, perhaps quite rightly. It is certainly in the call
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:40.040]   of Abraham, because our Lord said, "Abraham saw my day." In the seventeenth chapter of
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:45.520]   Genesis, what happened to Abraham there is a kind of adumbration of the gospel and all
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.880]   the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. His very offering of Isaac may be a dim suggestion
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:35:00.560]   of it. It is there, it is in the law. But, of course, supremely, it is in all the ceremonial
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:07.520]   law, which you find beginning in the book of Exodus and elaborated so extensively in
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:14.080]   the book of Leviticus. What is all this? What is all this about these burnt offerings and
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:19.840]   sacrifices, these meal offerings and sweet offerings and so on, and peace offerings?
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:25.440]   What does it all mean? My dear friends, it is nothing but a foreshadowing of the Lord
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:33.680]   Jesus Christ and all that he has done. It is the law witnessing to this thing that God
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.720]   has done once and forever in the person of his only begotten Son.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:46.200]   And then, you see, you go on from the law to the prophets, which includes the book of
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.760]   Psalms, because there are many prophecies in the book of Psalms. You are familiar with
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.720]   many of them. You remember how the twenty-second Psalm is a perfect description of our Lord's
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:01.320]   crucifixion and death, and there are many others, those messianic Psalms. And then take
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:08.840]   with them the great prophecies. You remember the prophecy about a virgin bearing a son
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:15.080]   in Isaiah 7? You remember the prophecy in chapter 9 and chapter 11 of Isaiah? You remember
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:20.600]   the great fortieth chapter? "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God." God
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.240]   is about to do it, and the picture of John the Baptist preparing the way, and the great
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:30.400]   personage who is coming, and the results of his coming, it is all looking forward to him,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:37.640]   as to by the prophets. In Jeremiah 23, verse 6, you read this, "This is the name whereby
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:44.800]   ye shall be called the Lord our righteousness, the righteousness of God by faith in Jesus
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:50.520]   Christ." The prophets were witnessing to it, foretelling it.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:56.240]   Then think of Daniel with his prophecies, especially chapter 9. He will tell you the
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.760]   exact time. He will tell you about this Messiah that is going to be cut off in the middle
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:08.960]   of the third week. It is nothing but a foretelling. It is a witnessing of all this which has happened.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:14.720]   Get it in the prophecy of Zechariah. Indeed, you have got it everywhere. I need not keep
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.200]   you with this. Go through it for yourselves, but let me remind you how you will read in
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.560]   the twenty-fourth chapter of Luke's Gospel, the last chapter of Luke's Gospel. We are
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:30.000]   told there that the Lord himself, after his resurrection, took the incredulous apostles,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.920]   disciples, took them through the books of Moses, and the Psalms, and the prophets, and
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:44.800]   showed them there all the things pertaining unto himself. How they had foreseen it all,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.400]   his death, his resurrection, it is all there. Peter, you remember, put it again in that
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.560]   first chapter of his first epistle. He says, "These people did not quite understand what
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.520]   they were writing about, these things that were going to happen to us. They did not know
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.320]   when these things were going to take place. What did they talk about?" He says, "They
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:12.040]   prophesied concerning the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow."
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.760]   Now work it all out for yourselves. Go through the great details. I am much more concerned
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:24.440]   to make certain comments, and here they are. Don't you see here the importance of taking
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:31.400]   the two sections of the Bible always together? Don't you see here the importance of having
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:37.480]   the two Testaments? Don't you see how the two Testaments are absolutely vital even for
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.360]   Christians? I have known Christian people who have rather taken the view, "Ah, well
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.000]   of course now we needn't bother about the Old Testament," so they just carry a New
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.040]   Testament in their pockets. They don't need the Old Testament, they think. Oh, what a
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:55.920]   tragic error that is. You need the whole Bible. If you really want to understand the truth
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.240]   in its fullness, you see how vital it is to have the Old as well as the New. And there
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:07.320]   is no doubt that it was the Holy Spirit himself that led the early Church, which at that time
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   had become mainly Gentile, to hold on to the Old Testament, the Scriptures of the Jews,
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.600]   and to incorporate it in one book with their new literature, their Gospels, their Acts,
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.840]   and their Epistles. That was the leading of the Holy Ghost. If they had been left to themselves
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.320]   like many of us, they would have said, "Well, we don't need to know all that anymore. Of
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.120]   course, Christ has come and I know the Gospel." But oh, what a truncated Gospel you have got
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.440]   if you do that, and how incomplete is your understanding. But it is very important for
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:53.840]   this reason. Any way of explaining salvation that does not show that the New Testament
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:02.200]   Gospel is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy is wrong. And there is a great deal of that
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:09.120]   today. They deny and criticize much of the Old Testament. "Oh," they say, "we are
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.920]   only interested in the Gospel." Here I am saying the Apostle lays it down very plainly
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:20.200]   and clearly, as you find it in other places in the New Testament, that unless my explanation
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:26.280]   of the way of salvation is clearly a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy, it is not a
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:33.000]   true statement of the way of salvation. Or, to put that in another way, let me put it
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:43.320]   like this. A way of stating the Gospel that puts it as a contrast to the Old Testament
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:51.080]   is entirely wrong. But you know, there are many who do that. "Oh," they say, "that
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   Old Testament, of course, had a very inadequate notion of God and of his love in those days,
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.680]   and therefore you have got all that sacrificial teaching and all that talk about blood. That
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:08.600]   is legalism," they say, "that is Judaism. We are not interested in that at all." They
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:17.640]   deny it all, they reject it all, and they put the Gospel as a contrast to that. That
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.840]   is because they do not like preaching about the blood of Christ. That is because they
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:28.440]   do not like the doctrine of the wrath of God. You see, if you deny the doctrines of the
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.120]   wrath of God and the blood of Christ, you have got to reject your Old Testament. And
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.760]   that is why they do so, and they are perfectly consistent with themselves. Yes, but they
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.840]   deny the teaching of the Apostle, who says that this righteousness of God has been manifested
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:50.840]   now, but it was witnessed unto by the law and by the prophets. It is latent in the Old,
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:56.480]   it is patent in the New, as Augustine put it. It is there in the Old, if you have got
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   eyes to see it. The tragedy of the Jews was that they could not see it, but it was there
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:09.720]   the whole time. But now it has been revealed and manifested in a much greater and a much
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:15.920]   more glorious and fuller manner. Very well, we shall have to leave it at that point for
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:25.760]   this evening. But I do trust and pray that we have got hold of some of these great principles.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:36.160]   This section, I say, is authoritative for all preaching and presentation of the Gospel.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:42.200]   A man very quickly betrays what his view of the Gospel is when he tells you his view of
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:51.480]   the Old Testament, you see. If they wipe out all the sacrificial law and all this appeasing
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.000]   of God, this propitiation, the term we are going to come to, if they hate that and say
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.080]   they do not accept it, that that is an inadequate view of God and an unworthy view of God, well,
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:07.560]   they do not realize it, but they are denying the New Testament at the same time. For the
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:13.760]   New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old. What was prophesied there has actually now
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.520]   come to pass and is fully open before us. You cannot put a wedge between the New Testament
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   and the Old Testament. It was the Holy Ghost, I say, who led the early church to incorporate
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.680]   the Old with their new literature.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:42.240]   If we remember nothing else there for this evening, let us remember that the law is our
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:49.760]   schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. The law, at one and the same time, shows us our desperate
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:57.240]   need and points forward to his coming. What a perfect schoolmaster the law was. It did
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:04.760]   the two things that were essential. It convicts of sin; it points to the way of salvation.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:14.720]   Again, I would add that any notion of salvation that leaves out the law work is seriously
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:25.520]   defective because it was to save us from the condemnation of the law and the wrath of God
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:40.800]   that the Son of God came and did all he did on our behalf. Let us pray.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:51.600]   O Lord our God, we thank thee for these two words but now. O we thank thee for the entire
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:59.480]   difference that they make to us that the knowledge of thy dear Son and all that thou
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:08.120]   hast done in him and through him has made to us. O Lord, we thank thee that thou who
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:16.120]   didst make him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:25.600]   of God in him. We thank thee that thou hast revealed this unto us. O God open, our understanding
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:34.360]   we pray thee by thy Spirit more and more that we may rejoice in it as we ought. And now
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:42.040]   may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:51.600]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.880]   Amen.
