[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.280]   - Welcome to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.260]   Today we are joined by our friend Ted Tripp,
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.400]   known for his best-selling book,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.440]   "Shepherding a Child's Heart"
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.680]   and "Instructing a Child's Heart."
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.040]   Dr. Tripp, we often get questions in the inbox
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.640]   about family worship.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.000]   It's a practice many Christian families
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.840]   engage in together at home, but what is it?
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.120]   I mean, what does family worship look like for you,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.240]   and what are the aims and goals of it?
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.160]   - Well, I think family worship is such an important thing
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160]   because it gives weight and mass
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.440]   to the spiritual realities you're talking to your kids about.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.120]   I mean, if you're talking to your kids about
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.340]   vitality of knowing and loving God,
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.180]   and the joys of loving God, and the goodness of God,
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.880]   it makes sense that you would spend, you know,
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.920]   10 or 15 minutes in a day reading the Bible,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.400]   praying together, acknowledging God,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.880]   and seeking God in your life as family.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.960]   So I think that it's a very, very important thing.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.120]   Now, one of the things in terms of what it looks like,
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.600]   I think of it, the most simple terms of three things.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.560]   I wanna read, sing, and pray with the kids.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.280]   So I wanna sing together, I wanna read the Bible together,
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.920]   and talk about the passage that we looked at,
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.060]   and I wanna pray together.
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.120]   And I think you engage the kids in that.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.080]   I mean, singing is such a wonderful thing
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.540]   because singing puts truth into your head
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.840]   in memorable ways.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.800]   It ties truth to rhythm and melody,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.680]   and it's a great way to memorize.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.040]   We had such a fun time this summer.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.160]   We were watching five of our grandchildren
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.580]   for a week while their parents were in England.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.480]   And we rode along one day,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.480]   we were driving in the car together,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.800]   and we sang for probably an hour,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.640]   just sang hymns from memory.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.160]   And these kids had learned all these hymns
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.920]   that they had been singing at home with their parents.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.480]   And it was great fun.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.400]   They were singing away, and it was just wonderful.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.200]   I think singing is such an important part
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.500]   of family worship.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.420]   Reading the Bible, reading the passage,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.280]   looking at the passage, talking about it is key,
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.480]   and then, of course, praying.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.680]   And saying to the kids, "We wanna pray.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.860]   "We wanna pray about the passage.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.440]   "We wanna pray about any family needs
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.720]   "we have at the moment."
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.280]   And the whole range of things.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.880]   Daddy knows we need a new car.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.440]   Let's pray to God to help us to find a good car
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.320]   that we can afford, that will meet our needs, and so forth.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.600]   And so you're making that car-purchasing decision
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.200]   in a matter of prayer.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.280]   God, give us wisdom.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.560]   Lead us to the right car.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.600]   We prayed when our kids were little.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.560]   We prayed for sick cats and dogs.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.480]   I mean, everything.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.540]   Whatever the kids were concerned about,
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.720]   if it was their concern,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.760]   we wanted to convey to them the truth,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.500]   that God is concerned with the things
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.480]   that we're concerned about.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.160]   God is good, and He loves us,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.280]   and He is open to our prayers,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.600]   and there's nothing too small,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   there's nothing too big to bring to God.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.160]   So I think that that's a very, very valuable time.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.560]   I think scripture memorization's
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   another great thing to add to that.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.320]   We used to memorize, we memorized,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.840]   we started memorizing Psalms together,
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.680]   and we went through whole chapters of the Bible.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.820]   I mean, big chapters, like the High Priestly Prayer.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.080]   That's such an important chapter, John 17.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.160]   You know, the love chapter in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.000]   You know, those kinds of things.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.040]   The whole Christology there in Philippians chapter two,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.440]   of this mind being you, that was also in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.160]   But we found it was very easy to memorize with kids
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.880]   simply by reading the passage every day.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.800]   If you read it every day,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.520]   within two weeks your kids have it memorized.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.000]   You know, a month or so later,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.200]   you and your wife will know it.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.680]   It's very easy to memorize with kids.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.960]   So I found that to be an incredibly valuable thing.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.480]   You know, I had the joy, you know,
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.400]   my personal testimony is that I was raised in a home
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.240]   where we always had family worship.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.040]   My dad wasn't very creative with it.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.400]   All we did was we read the Bible and we prayed.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.240]   I can remember my brothers learning to read
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.200]   as we sat around the table reading the Bible every morning.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.880]   And you know, times when they stumbled through the words
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.500]   and had to be helped with a lot of the words,
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.360]   and eventually they could read them all fluidly.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.280]   And we prayed together, that's all we did.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.120]   And you know, dad made very little commentary.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.320]   It wasn't really, I mean,
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.880]   I think there's much more he could have done.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.640]   But the fact is we had that 10 minutes every single day
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.680]   at the beginning of the day,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.940]   that's when he chose to do it,
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.160]   where we read the Bible and prayed together.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.200]   There was that acknowledgement of God
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.320]   and God's place in our lives
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.400]   that was part of every single day.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.080]   And I think that was incredibly significant for me.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.960]   And I think, you know, of my brother Paul and I
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.560]   and the opportunities in ministry
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.440]   that God has showered on us.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.800]   And I think that in many ways,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.960]   that heritage has contributed enormously
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.540]   to our lives and to our ministry.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.400]   - Amen, the Lord has used you and your brother Paul
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.080]   and the church in some incredible ways.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.400]   Thank you, Dr. Tripp, for joining us again
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   to talk about family worship.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.680]   Who knows what opportunities for ministry
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.560]   will be open to our children in the future?
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.600]   That's one of the takeaways I take from this episode
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.120]   for me as a dad.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.520]   And I should mention, Dr. Tripp recently appeared
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.580]   in episodes number 439 to 443 of this podcast
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.960]   in a week we dedicated to parenting.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.600]   And I suppose every episode of this podcast
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.040]   reminds me of another episode we've recorded in the past.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.720]   And if you find this annoying, I'm sorry,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.360]   but this episode on family worship reminds me
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.880]   of an episode with Pastor John on family prayers
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.800]   titled Mealtime Prayers, Impromptu or Memorized.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.420]   That was episode number 126 in the archive.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.000]   Be sure to check that out.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.940]   We're back tomorrow.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.780]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.280]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.440]   (upbeat music)
