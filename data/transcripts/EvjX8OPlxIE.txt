[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   The solution to your problem is not going to be found in the problem. It's not going to be found
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.600]   in there. You have to get out of the problem so that you can look at it, make an assessment,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.600]   and you can assess how to solve the problem or whether you need to solve the problem or not.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.840]   I mean, there's a lot of things in my life right now where I shrug my shoulders and go, "Okay,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:28.720]   okay. Oh, someone's saying this. Okay. Roger that. Like, carry on. No factor. Move on."
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.240]   And then occasionally, you go, "Okay, this is something I need to contend with. This is
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.120]   something I need to deal with. This is something I need to shape or adjust or move or solve,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.600]   to use your word." And the reason I laugh when I say that is because
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.040]   problems, you have to get in there, but if you take a step back, you can usually say,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.880]   "Oh, a little adjustment here, a little adjustment there," and that thing's going to sort itself out.
