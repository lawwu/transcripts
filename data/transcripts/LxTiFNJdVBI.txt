[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   So it's mid-summer.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.700]   This means people have a little breathing room
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.060]   in their professional schedule.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.900]   They're a little bit more relaxed and open than normal.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.940]   So I thought this would be a good moment
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.940]   to revisit some of the biggest ideas
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.400]   about the biggest topic that we cover on this show,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.900]   productivity, right?
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.260]   Look, in a world in which digital distractions
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.140]   and diversions are constantly grabbing at your attention
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.260]   or fragmenting your schedule or driving you crazy
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.660]   with relentless, frenetic, shallow activity,
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.340]   it has never been harder to take control
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.600]   of your time and attention
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600]   and aim it at what really matters.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.500]   I can help you with this.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.840]   So what I thought I would do here
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.240]   would be to review five of the biggest ideas I've had
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.260]   about finding productivity in a distracted world.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.100]   You've heard these in bits and pieces
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100]   and I mention them all the time,
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.800]   but I'm bringing them all together
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.700]   into one consolidated productivity primer.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.540]   Let's get us all back on the same stage
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.940]   about how to gain back some sort of deep control
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.240]   of our life in a distracted world.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.600]   And this I thought would be a perfect time to do it.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.940]   All right, so before I get to my five core strategies
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.940]   to suggest, let's just start
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.400]   with a quick foundational question
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.340]   because I think it's important
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.800]   to calibrate everything we're doing here.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.800]   What do we mean by productivity?
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.840]   Now, in the context of knowledge work,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840]   which is the vast majority of my audience,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.800]   productivity can be a tricky topic to talk about.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   It's because this term has become more,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.440]   I wouldn't say taboo,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.000]   but more of a source of distrust or discomfort,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.480]   especially in certain online cultures.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.080]   So why?
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.900]   Why are people upset about the idea of productivity?
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.740]   We have to answer this
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.300]   before we try to pursue it ourselves.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.900]   I think there's two reasons,
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.040]   two different reasons why people are wary
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.200]   about this term right now.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.300]   Reason number one, in the context of office work,
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.580]   office workers often confuse the term productivity
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.340]   with what I call pseudoproductivity.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.440]   Now, pseudoproductivity is a concept from my new book,
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.000]   which is called slow productivity.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.840]   So I'm using the word productivity a lot here,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.540]   but in my new work, Slow Productivity,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.340]   I introduced this notion of pseudoproductivity.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.340]   Pseudoproductivity is this rough heuristic
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.740]   we use to sort of approximate useful effort in office work,
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.980]   where we say busyness, that is visible activity,
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.640]   will be our proxy for useful effort.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.540]   This rough heuristic reigns supreme in office work.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.440]   So when a lot of office workers think about productivity,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.880]   what they're really thinking about is pseudoproductivity.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   And the problem with pseudoproductivity
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.840]   is that it's performative and it's grueling.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.440]   To increase your pseudoproductivity,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.640]   you just have to be busier.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.200]   Answer emails faster, answer Slack better,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.080]   do more virtual meetings,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.000]   chime in on these conversations at night,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.640]   on the weekends, in the morning.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.740]   It is exhausting.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.840]   The only way to increase your pseudoproductivity
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.200]   is to make your life itself more exhausting.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.340]   So when people think you're saying,
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.840]   "Yeah, we wanna improve pseudoproductivity,"
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.700]   of course they get upset
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.440]   because that is performative and grueling.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.280]   It is not, however,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.920]   what we're gonna be talking about today.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.600]   The second reason why people get upset about productivity
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.640]   is the cultural critics in particular
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.960]   associate it very closely
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.020]   with the mathematical concept of optimization,
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.120]   which they take to mean in the context of work,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.600]   fitting as many things as possible into your life
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.680]   and doing those things
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.140]   at the absolute highest level possible.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.880]   So optimizing what you can fit
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.380]   and optimizing the performance of what you do.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.160]   Cultural critics say, look, an obsession with optimization
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.400]   is itself also exhausting.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.040]   As Oliver Berkman points out,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.260]   it's also ultimately gonna be futile
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.520]   because the vast majority of things you can't do anyways.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.560]   So why obsess about fitting in more?
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.400]   What's the difference?
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.160]   Why not just relax a little bit?
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.900]   I think this anti-optimization critique of productivity
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.320]   really got a sort of intellectual jolt in the arm in 2019
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.560]   from Ginny O'Dell's work,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.160]   in particular her book, "How to Do Nothing."
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.920]   Ginny O'Dell was drawing from the work
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.720]   of an Italian communist philosopher,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.760]   found a way of actually bringing labor critique concepts
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.940]   from communism and Marxism
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.020]   over to critiques of knowledge work
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.480]   and things such as like our phones,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.880]   computers, and social media.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.320]   So she introduced a lot of this sort of
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.800]   modernized Marxist terminology to critiquing optimization,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.640]   especially digital optimization,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.080]   a lot of terminology about internalizing narratives
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.840]   of capitalist production and efficiency
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.240]   and then playing those out in our own lives.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.640]   Cultural critics love this stuff.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.000]   And so a lot of that terminology has spread
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   through the discussions of productivity.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.360]   So that's the other reason why people are suspicious.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.200]   They think of it as optimization,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.440]   fit as much as possible,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.580]   do that stuff increasingly at higher and higher levels,
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.040]   which yeah, that can be tiring as well.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.440]   So what do we mean?
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.640]   Well, not quite either of those things.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.160]   When I talk about personal productivity,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.720]   I typically have two goals in mind.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.720]   The first is the ability to control your time and attention
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   so you can be intentional about what receives your energy.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.320]   This allows you to better shape your life
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.120]   towards deeper objectives.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.240]   The second goal I have for personal productivity,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.060]   separate your results from exhaustion.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.120]   Be smart about how you tackle specific work
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.360]   so that you can produce good results
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.320]   without wasting large amounts of time and energy
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.680]   or falling towards burnout.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.640]   If what you're doing isn't sustainable,
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.200]   then you're not doing it right.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.040]   Okay, so the second element of personal productivity,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.240]   find a way to do whatever you wanna do that's sustainable.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.520]   That's very unique to me, I would say.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.440]   I am very sensitive to tiredness.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.900]   I'm very sensitive to stress.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.920]   So this has been a big undercurrent
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.300]   in my professional discussion of productivity
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.560]   is how do we avoid those things?
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.820]   I do not like the idea of hustling.
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.920]   I do not like the idea of burning the midnight oil
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.800]   and just getting after it and waking up at five
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.400]   and working harder than the other person.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.940]   I'm not well wired for it.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.000]   So this is unique to my flavor of personal productivity
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   is the key is sustainability.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It's not gonna exhaust you.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   You have flexibility.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.800]   That's important to me.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.360]   This first part though, gets to the key
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.280]   of what we really mean by personal productivity,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.400]   which is you can control what you're doing when you do it,
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   why you're doing it.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.820]   So to me, here's the choice.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.960]   If you wanna pursue this definition of productivity,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.640]   you gain control over what you do,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.840]   and you're trying to be very careful
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.460]   about avoiding burnout producing patterns.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.200]   To not do this means you're in danger
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.080]   of falling to the opposite,
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.120]   being not in control of your time and attention
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.360]   and not being particularly careful
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.080]   about trying to avoid burnout or unsustainable work habits.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.700]   You're much more likely to be overloaded
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.560]   or frenetic or exhausted.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.960]   So what do you do with these skills?
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.740]   So if you do gain this definition of personal productivity,
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.580]   what do you do with them?
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.900]   Well, look, it's up to you.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.240]   Like, I think it's fine, for example,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.760]   to put these skills to use for a while,
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.880]   to kind of do the old school optimization
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.480]   that the cultural critics worry about and say,
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.100]   you know, I'm gonna try to get after it
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.600]   and get really good at these skills
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.320]   or be a huge standout at my job for the, you know,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.140]   during my 20s as a way of like building up autonomy
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.640]   and career capital and really setting myself up
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.480]   on the right foundation.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.300]   There's a time for that,
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.140]   and these skills could of course help you with that.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.680]   But you can use the exact same skills
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   we're gonna talk about here to minimize the time needed
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.520]   to do a good enough job at your job
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.280]   that no one is gonna notice you.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.520]   So if you're at a time in your life
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.040]   where you need more flexibility or just a break,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.520]   maybe you have new kids
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.220]   or you're caring for a sick relative,
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.660]   or you're really looking to invest
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.100]   in other parts of your life,
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.240]   your personal transformation
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.300]   and important involvement in your community,
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.880]   these same tools can be used to help you take your work
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.520]   and squeeze that footprint down small
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.880]   in a way that people like, hey, Cal's doing great.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.080]   It doesn't catch our attention.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.680]   And yet you've spread out and can compress this work
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.960]   in such a way you have a lot of free time.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.160]   You can also deploy the type of ideas
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.000]   we're gonna talk about here
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.700]   to systematically transform your life outside of work.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.580]   We talk a lot on the show about the deep life,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.280]   a life lived intentionally and on purpose.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.160]   I'm actually writing the book about this right now.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.700]   And the very first part of the book
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.820]   is about preparing before you start to change.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.320]   'Cause if you can't gain control of your life,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.740]   you can't hope to transform it.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.960]   So these same ideas can be used to help you
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   transform your life towards things that resonate
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.880]   and away from things that don't.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.600]   So I think there's a lot of potential uses of productivity
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.520]   beyond just these much more simplistic ideas
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.040]   that it's all about pseudo productivity
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.280]   or just trying to optimize everything you do.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.400]   All right, enough preamble.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.880]   Let's get five pieces of advice here.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   The first idea I wanna talk about is multi-scale planning.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.560]   This is my answer to the question of what should I do next?
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.720]   This is the fundamental question
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.380]   in controlling your time and attention is,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.880]   what do I do right now?
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.100]   What am I gonna do after that?
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.140]   This is a tricky question to answer
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.000]   because what you're trying to do here
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.600]   is not just find something useful to do next,
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.200]   but somehow have your answer to this question
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.080]   connect to your interest and objectives
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.200]   and systems on many different timescales, right?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.360]   That somehow when you're deciding what to do next,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.880]   you have to navigate between the reactive
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.560]   and urgent in the moment
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.960]   and things that could be completely non-urgent
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.440]   and completely optional,
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   but is maybe a project that you wanna make progress on
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.420]   over the course of the year
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.440]   that's gonna be important to you.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.720]   All of these concerns have to get integrated
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.120]   into deciding what do I do next?
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.240]   The problem, however, is we don't have the time or energy
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.440]   to take into account everything on our plate,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.000]   all of our different goals and objectives
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.360]   and what's going on in our systems
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.640]   and how our projects are unfolding
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.560]   and where things are and what needs to be done.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.440]   We cannot take this all into account
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.680]   every time we have a new moment to say,
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.520]   what do I do next?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.920]   We would just collapse into planning paralysis.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.680]   This is where multiscale planning enters the scene, right?
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.520]   Here's the idea.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.040]   You plan at multiple timescales.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.960]   Each timescale is informed by the one before it.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.500]   So you have what I call a strategic plan
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.380]   or a quarterly plan.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.840]   This is a bigger picture plan about your big objectives.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.040]   You should have one for your work.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.680]   You should have one for your life outside of work.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.760]   So you're figuring out this is what I'm up to this year.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.040]   And in this season, in order to make progress
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.440]   on this big goal, here's what I'm doing.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.840]   I'm gonna finally pick up this skill
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.000]   or this project that's been put on my plate.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.300]   I'm gonna nail this project above and beyond this winter
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.720]   because that's gonna really open up big possibilities.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.560]   Or this is the spring in which I'm gonna completely
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.520]   overhaul my fitness and my personal life.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.680]   I think my health is bad and this is gonna be the time
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.000]   where I'm gonna make this major change.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.900]   It's gonna take a few months,
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.280]   but this is where I'm gonna kickstart a new way of living.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.620]   So the strategic or quarterly plans
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.080]   is where you have these big picture visions
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.000]   for your life and your life outside of work.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.040]   You update these definitely once a year,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.080]   but you kind of check back in with them every season.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.480]   Okay, each week then you build a plan
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.960]   for the week ahead of you.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.920]   This is what we call the weekly plan.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.440]   When you build your weekly plan,
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.660]   you go back and you check the strategic plan.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.180]   That is when you consult it.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.560]   And so when you're looking at the week ahead,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.800]   you can have these questions about,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.840]   okay, what for my strategic plan do I wanna try
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.360]   to remind myself or integrate into my week?
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.060]   When you're doing your weekly plan,
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.840]   this is also where you can survey your calendar,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.660]   identify the good spots
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.320]   for getting certain types of work done.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.440]   This is where you see like, oh, Monday actually
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.800]   is a pretty clear afternoon.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.280]   So Monday at three, I'm gonna cut off work there
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.480]   to go to the whatever.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.280]   I have a giant errand I wanna do
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.200]   that's gonna be connected to a big lifestyle goal I'm doing.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.680]   I'm gonna go to the gym supply store
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.880]   to finally buy like a barbell and barbell weights.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.960]   It's gonna take an hour and a half.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.160]   Here's the right time to do it.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.320]   Friday morning is open.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.720]   That's when I'm gonna really like write the draft
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.080]   of this book proposal I'm working on.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.360]   So you're sort of looking at the whole week at once
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.140]   and seeing where you have the right times
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.200]   for working on things.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.040]   This is also where you can make some changes
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.880]   where you say, you know what?
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.800]   My Thursday would be perfect for me
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.320]   to spend the whole day working on this project
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.120]   except for I have this stupid call at two.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720]   So let's move that call
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.440]   'cause that's in the way of this day being perfect
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.160]   for my bigger picture plan.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.320]   When you're doing your weekly plan,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.040]   you might add some stuff onto your calendar.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.920]   Great, here's some big rocks I wanna make sure I get done.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.960]   Let me put them on my calendar now like an appointment
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.240]   so that time is protected.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.120]   You should also write out some sort of plan
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.440]   for your week long hand as well.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.800]   You could type this, you can write it
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.460]   into like my time block planner has a weekly plan page.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.700]   And this reminders to yourself,
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.980]   remember we're doing this every day.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.900]   Here's what we're doing like with workouts.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.820]   The main professional push this week
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.860]   is going to be trying to get this report done.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.300]   So let's try to get a couple hours every morning on this
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.880]   before we switch over to admin.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.100]   It's notes to yourself
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.260]   about how you're going through this week.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.700]   So now you have a plan for your week
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.460]   that takes into account the reality of your week
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.120]   and maybe even alter that reality a little bit.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.300]   Big things are on your calendar.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.140]   You have notes to yourself as well
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.140]   about what to keep in mind as the week unfolds.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.200]   This will reflect what you saw
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.740]   in your strategic or quarterly plans.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.940]   Now we go to the final timescale,
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.220]   the finest timescale, which is every day.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.100]   As every day starts,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.900]   you're gonna build a time block plan for your work day.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.620]   You're gonna block off the hours of your day
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.860]   and give every block a job.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.940]   Okay, during this two hours,
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.340]   I'm working specifically on this.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.860]   The half hour that follows, I'm checking my email,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.640]   catching up on as much as possible in that half hour.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.980]   Then I have lunch, then there's 30 minutes free,
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.660]   and then there is this meeting.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.800]   So I put the meeting,
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.460]   I'm gonna put 20 minutes after the meeting
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.860]   for actually consolidating my notes on the meeting.
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.700]   And in that 30 minutes between lunch and the meeting,
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.140]   I have this list here of five small chores
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.980]   that I'm gonna try to get done.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.100]   These five small tasks, submitting this form,
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.460]   calling the IT department.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.740]   Let me get that done in this space.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.700]   You're giving your time a job.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.700]   So you're figuring out a good way
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.700]   to make use of your work time in advance,
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.180]   as opposed to just going through your day
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.780]   and continually asking, "Hey, what do I wanna work on?"
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.300]   Next, here's the key.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.300]   Before you build your time block day for a specific day,
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.780]   your time block plan, rather,
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.220]   you look at your weekly plan.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.340]   'Cause your weekly plan is gonna inform
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.620]   what happens in your time block plan.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.300]   First of all, of course, you have to copy over
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.700]   everything that's on your calendar,
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.460]   but you might have these reminders in your weekly plan.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.540]   Hey, we're trying to write every morning.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.100]   Make sure that we do this at the end of the day.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.740]   So you're making sure those notes from your weekly plan
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.340]   get integrated to your plan for the day,
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.660]   and then you execute your time block plan.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.500]   So now when we get to a particular moment
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500]   in a particular day,
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.780]   how do you answer the question of what I should do next?
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.180]   It's whatever time block you're in will tell you.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.780]   But that time block is influenced by your weekly plan.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.700]   And that weekly plan itself is influenced
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.180]   by your quarterly or strategic plan.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.820]   So now you're wasting very little energy
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.700]   in the moment deciding what I do next,
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.220]   but that decision connects to your priorities
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.860]   at multiple different timescales.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.940]   So time block planning is how
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.860]   you not only get more out of your day,
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.980]   but how you ensure progress is made on things that matter,
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.060]   even if these things aren't all urgent,
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.820]   do the next day, or right there in your face.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.060]   So multi-scale planning,
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.140]   critical key to controlling your time and attention.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.980]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.580]   I wanted to interrupt briefly
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.940]   to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.140]   then you need to check out my new book,
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.940]   "Slow Productivity,
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.820]   "The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.540]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.260]   we talk about here in these videos.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.260]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.300]   I know you're gonna like it.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.340]   Check it out.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.580]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.060]   All right, idea number two,
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.920]   office hours, meeting windows, and project protocols.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.500]   These are three things that are all trying
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.480]   to solve the same problem.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.840]   So if you read my 2021 book, "A World Without Email,"
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.800]   I identify what I think is the number one productivity poison
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.560]   in the knowledge work sector.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.680]   And it's not necessarily what people think.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.180]   The number one productivity poison is context switching.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.560]   Every time you change your attention
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.840]   from one target to another,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.200]   you instigate an expensive neurological process
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.240]   where your brain is trying to actually switch
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.440]   which networks are activated
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.520]   and inhibit other networks that are no longer relevant.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.160]   This is an expensive operation.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.000]   It takes time.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.760]   It can take 10, 15, maybe 20 minutes
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.440]   for your brain to completely switch
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.000]   its semantic context from one target to another.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.360]   So what happens when you keep context switching rapidly
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.240]   throughout your work,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.300]   where you're trying to work on, let's say, a report,
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.360]   but every few minutes you jump over to check Slack,
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.440]   you jump over to check email,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.480]   maybe you send a couple of emails,
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.720]   you come back to what you're working on,
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.680]   then jump over to check what's going on with the Olympics,
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.120]   and back to what you're working on.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.920]   Every time you switch your attention,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.640]   you instigate this expensive change.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.680]   But of course, you don't sit around in your email inbox
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.240]   or Slack or on the Olympics website for 20, 30 minutes,
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   giving yourself enough time
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.280]   to completely change this new context.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.800]   You actually halt that change after it begins,
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.520]   and then try to wrench your attention back
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.920]   to what you're originally working on.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.160]   And now you have that cognitive context tries to come back,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.560]   but before it could get completely back,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.840]   you switch to something else.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.720]   This creates a train wreck, cognitively speaking,
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.040]   inside your head, which makes it very difficult to focus.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.280]   This is why you find your sort of intellectual energy
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   begins to plummet.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.920]   It's like, "Oh man, I just feel sort of like fatigued.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.960]   "I feel like I can't think straight."
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.600]   It's a terrible type of state
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.080]   in which to try to do interesting work.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.320]   So you gotta minimize those context shifts.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.040]   Well, what's the number one source of context shifts?
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.480]   Ongoing back and forth, unscheduled conversation.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.280]   So if I have multiple conversations
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.960]   that are unfolding with back and forth emails,
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.080]   I have multiple conversations
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.440]   that are sort of unfolding unpredictably
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.760]   on a Slack channel,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.480]   I have to keep tending to those communication channels
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.280]   because I don't know when the reply to my message
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.040]   is gonna come in,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.360]   but I have to see that pretty quickly
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.400]   because I have to bounce it back
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.760]   to their side of the proverbial court
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   so they can bounce it back to me,
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.080]   and then I can bounce it back to them.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.320]   So we all have to start checking these inboxes
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.240]   and channels all the time
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.800]   to keep these ongoing conversations
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.280]   actually moving forward.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.600]   This is the number one source of context shifts.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.480]   These context shifts are productivity poison.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.080]   So office hours, meeting windows,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.520]   and project protocols are three ways
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.760]   to tame this source of context shifts.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.120]   Office hours says have set times most days
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.800]   where your door is open.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.720]   Maybe you have a virtual meeting room
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.520]   like a Zoom or Teams room activated,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.400]   your phone is on.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.520]   As much as possible,
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.040]   when someone tries to instigate
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.400]   a back and forth discussion with you over email and Slack,
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.720]   defer them to the office hours.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.560]   Yeah, that's important.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.680]   We should get into it.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.240]   Just grab me at my next office hours
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.360]   next time you're able.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.440]   Now, what you're doing here
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.680]   is taking these conversations
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.360]   that would have generated lots of back and forth messages,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.800]   which means lots even more checks of your inbox
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.280]   away for these messages,
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.720]   and it pushes them all to this one consolidated time
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.760]   where you can just in real time
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.360]   go back and forth and solve them.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.560]   If you can take three or four such conversations
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.240]   in a given day and push it to one,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.880]   one hour office hours meeting,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.640]   and therefore leave the rest of your day
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.240]   relatively uninterrupted,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.120]   it is a significant, significant win
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.240]   in terms of your exhaustion
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.120]   and ability to actually do work.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.520]   Meeting windows are similar.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.320]   People are constantly in our modern world saying,
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.160]   when can we have a meeting?
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.360]   When can we have a meeting?
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.640]   Here's an invite, here's an invite.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.800]   It's Zoom, it's Teams, all these virtual meetings.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.340]   Now that the friction involved in meetings is so low,
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.020]   we are inundated with requests for meetings.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.380]   Now this can be a problem in part
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.340]   because scheduling these meetings
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.740]   requires back and forth messages,
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.940]   creates context shifting,
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.360]   and the meetings begin to fall
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.380]   pretty haphazardly onto your schedule.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.940]   So it's very difficult to get through
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.400]   any extended period of your day
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.500]   without having some meeting
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.040]   that completely scrambles your brain
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.860]   and changes what you're thinking about.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.940]   Simplify this by having,
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.380]   here's the standard windows each day when I do meetings.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.220]   Right?
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.420]   Yeah, let's have a meeting.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.500]   I usually do these, you know,
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.260]   one to four, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays,
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.420]   you know, are all great for me.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.420]   Let me know if there's a slot in there coming up.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.380]   So you kind of consolidate,
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.300]   you take the options away of when the meetings happen,
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.980]   that simplifies scheduling,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.820]   and the meetings themselves are consolidated.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.620]   So like your mornings are free in this scenario.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.500]   Your Mondays and Fridays are free in this scenario.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.940]   You're less, your context shifting less.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.580]   If you think you can get away with it,
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.900]   use some sort of meeting planning software like Calendly.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.820]   So you're gonna say, yeah, we should definitely meet.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.320]   Here's the link, grab any time that works for you.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.920]   So now you've completely eliminated back and forth planning
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.200]   and you have full control over
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.720]   when you want these meetings to happen.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.200]   So they don't just fall haphazardly in your schedule.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.520]   The final advice here for reducing context switching
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.560]   is project protocols.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.600]   If you have an ongoing project
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.180]   you're gonna be working on for a while,
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.900]   take 20 minutes upfront to figure out
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.000]   how are we gonna communicate and collaborate here?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.040]   Don't just rock and roll on email
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.620]   and throwing random meetings at each other
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.080]   and just sort of hope it works out.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.000]   Figure out your protocol for this project.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.580]   Oh, we got to produce this report.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.580]   Let's take 20 minutes to figure out
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.940]   how that's gonna unfold.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.040]   If you build a protocol,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.320]   you can save yourself a lot of unscheduled messaging.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.280]   So for example, if you're working with someone else
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.640]   to produce report, a protocol might say something like,
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.840]   okay, I will write a rough draft of this report
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.580]   in a shared document and I'll get that done by Thursday.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.080]   All right, I'll get it done by Thursday
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.400]   at close of business, right?
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.600]   So that'll just, you can expect it
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.720]   starting Friday morning, it is available.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.680]   Take a look on Friday, add any edits or suggestions
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.080]   that you have throughout Friday.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.160]   On my Monday office hours, which are from three to four,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.400]   swing by my office and we'll talk it through.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   I will read your comments before those office hours.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.620]   I'm putting that on my calendar now
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.520]   and then we can have a real time discussion about it.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.240]   Then during that discussion on office hours,
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   we can figure out what the final edits are.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.560]   And then I'll put aside time on like that Wednesday
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.480]   to make my pass on those final edits.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.400]   I'll have it done by 12, starting at 12,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.520]   you can grab the document, you finalize it,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.680]   send it to the designer, CC me when you do it.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.400]   As long as we get to him by the end of day Wednesday,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.520]   we should be fine.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.160]   Look, this sounds like a bit of a pain.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.640]   The sit down and take 15 minutes
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.000]   to figure out a protocol like that
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.040]   for this particular project.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.500]   But think about what you just saved.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.000]   With that style of project protocol in place,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.960]   there are no unscheduled emails, no unscheduled Slack chats.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.280]   No like, hey, what's going on, going back and forth.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.520]   You just know when to work and when it's gonna happen.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.520]   You have saved yourself from context switches.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.320]   So project protocol, spending 15 minutes up front
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.360]   to figure out how something's gonna unfold,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.640]   saves you so much context switching
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.040]   and unscheduled communication down the line.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.840]   So office hours, meeting windows and project protocols,
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.080]   they go a long way towards saving your brain.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.300]   All right, that's two ideas.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.140]   Let's do idea number three of five.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.240]   Deep to shallow work ratios.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.000]   All right, this is the foundational idea
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.880]   from my book, "Deep Work."
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.320]   When you're trying to do something cognitively demanding,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.920]   the best way to do this is in a state that I call deep work,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.960]   which says you're giving it your full attention
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.520]   and you're not context switching at all.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.280]   This is getting your sustained attention until you're done.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.320]   So when you're thinking about your workday,
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.960]   you have to separate and treat separately deep work
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.320]   from non-deep work, which we often call shallow work
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.360]   just for simplicity.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.040]   All right, shallow work, you're doing emails, meetings,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.840]   you're jumping back and forth between documents,
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.260]   you're seeing a lot of different information.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.680]   Deep work, you're completely locked in,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.520]   completely uninterrupted.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.220]   Treat these two things separately.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.240]   Now, once you treat these two things separately,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.660]   you can ask the question of how much deep work am I doing?
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.520]   I argue that most knowledge work jobs should identify
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.620]   an ideal deep to shallow work ratio
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.040]   for say a standard work week.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.140]   How many hours of my work in a standard week
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.000]   should be deep versus shallow?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.360]   This ratio might differ depending on your job,
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.960]   and that's fine.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.880]   This is one of the misnomers about deep work
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.120]   is that people think the argument
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.500]   is that deep work is all that matters
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.400]   and all you should be doing is deep work.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.040]   This is true for basically no one
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.760]   except maybe professional literary novelist, right?
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.900]   No, the goal is these are two different things
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.740]   that are both important,
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.040]   but you need to be very intentional
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.400]   about how much deep work you should be doing
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.080]   in order to sort of be as valuable as possible in your job.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.600]   So you should know your ideal deep to shallow work ratio.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.800]   You should measure how many hours were deep
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.920]   and non-deep this week
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.160]   and see how far you are from your ideal ratio.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.760]   If you're far off of it, now you make changes.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.480]   Now you have a target to aim towards.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.800]   And what types of changes do you make?
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.000]   Well, now you're gonna start doing things
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.500]   like pre-scheduling deep work time,
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.400]   constraining meetings to meeting windows
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.680]   so that you have enough time left for deep work,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.520]   having meeting days and non-meeting days,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.880]   like all sorts of innovations can come out of this.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.240]   I highly suggest having this conversation
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.560]   with your supervisor,
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.240]   get them on board with your ideal deep to shallow work ratio
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.520]   so they too can get involved in helping to figure out
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.040]   how you can actually hit those numbers
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.040]   during a particular week.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.360]   Sometimes you need a supervisor to come in and say,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.320]   for example, Cal doesn't do meetings before noon.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.960]   We're trying to hit his 50/50 ratio
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.680]   and this is the only way we can do it.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.480]   Use this as a core metric
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.240]   in a world of sort of non-entry level knowledge work.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.000]   Use this ratio as a core metric
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.300]   that you're measuring and aiming towards.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.160]   The key thing here for all of this
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.240]   is you have to measure in increments of an hour.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.040]   There's no such thing as I did 10 minutes of deep work.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.180]   And the hour does not count if there's any context shifting.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.120]   If you have to take a call,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.560]   if you have to jump in on an inbox,
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.880]   if you have to keep a conversation going on Slack,
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.800]   that doesn't count as a deep work hour.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.640]   You really have to respect deep work hours
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.580]   as completely uninterrupted focus.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.200]   That is the state that produces real value.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.600]   It is notably better
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.840]   than spending that same time
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.280]   sort of working on the deep thing,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.540]   but having an occasional context shift.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.240]   So have an ideal deep to shallow work ratio,
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.040]   measure it and fight to hit that metric.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.040]   That alone could 5X the value you're producing, right?
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.960]   When we're just kind of stumbling through our workday,
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.780]   if like I'm just doing stuff,
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.280]   I believe in pseudo productivity,
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.680]   I'm busy, I respond to things,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.500]   there's a lot going on, I feel very active and involved.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.280]   So much of your time there is either administrative
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.200]   or you struggling through the after effects
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.040]   of context switching that the actual amount
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.620]   of cognitive value produced could be pretty low.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.740]   Once you start caring about deep to shallow work ratios,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.560]   it's like a superpower.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.480]   Look at what happened to Cal, like he's killing it.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.080]   Like look at these code updates he's putting in,
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.400]   look at these new marketing strategies,
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.220]   look at the papers that he's producing,
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.360]   makes a big difference.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.680]   All right, idea number four, work in progress limits,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.800]   WIP limits as a terminology that I've taken
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.240]   from Kanban project management philosophies.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.800]   All right, I really pushed this in my new book,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.640]   Slow Productivity, and I really think it is critical.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.180]   You need a limit on how many non-trivial projects
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.280]   you're actively working on at any given time.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.240]   And that limit should be between one and three.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.560]   All right, this doesn't necessarily mean
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.160]   once you're actively working on a very big project
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.400]   that you have to stick with that big project
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.520]   until it's completely done.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.080]   You can break big projects down
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.280]   into more tractable milestones,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.780]   but you should only have one to three
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.040]   of these tractable milestones
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.980]   that you're working on actively at a time.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.960]   So I might not put write a book as an active project
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.400]   that that's what I'm working on until I'm done,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.440]   but I might put write chapter four of a book
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.100]   as a tractable milestone.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.360]   Okay, and so I'm gonna work,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.960]   that's what I'm actually working on right now.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.360]   Here's the key.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.280]   You keep this list of active projects
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.840]   or project milestones transparent.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.680]   Other people can see it.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.880]   Here's what I'm actively working on.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.240]   Here's what's queued up for me to work on next.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.680]   And for the things that you're not actively work on,
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.640]   you don't do administrative overhead related to them.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.760]   You don't have meetings about them.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.720]   You don't do email conversations about them.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.800]   They are just waiting,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.020]   putting no footprint on your schedule,
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.280]   no footprint on your attention
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.040]   until they move over to the active slot.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.160]   At which point now you're all in,
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.120]   you're working on it every day.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.040]   You're talking to people about it.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.560]   You're having meetings.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.400]   So when people say like,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.480]   hey, what's going on with this thing?
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.920]   You're like, can we have a meeting about it?
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.760]   Let's chat about it.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.840]   You're like, here's where it is.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.040]   It's in position three of my queue.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.520]   As soon as it moves over to active,
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.780]   I'll ping you and let's get a phone call.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.620]   Let's chat about it.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.120]   I'm gonna get after it as soon as it gets to active.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.880]   I'm not actively working on it now.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.640]   Now, this seems kind of like precious.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.160]   Like why bother?
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.480]   You know, why not just be more flexible?
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.140]   Kind of like work on what you wanna work on,
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.560]   keep everything sort of up there.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.520]   The reason is administrative overhead aggregates.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.360]   Everything that you're actively working on
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.040]   brings along with it its own administrative overhead.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.360]   This is conversations, this is email, this is Slack,
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   this is meetings, this is just brain cycles.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.280]   So the more things you're actively working on,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.680]   the more administrative overhead that enters your life.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.620]   This stuff adds up, it aggregates, right?
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.680]   So the more administrative overhead you have to handle,
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.260]   the less of your schedule is actually free
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.320]   to actually make work done.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.620]   And eventually you pass a threshold
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.000]   in which mainly what you're doing
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.180]   is just juggling administrative overhead frenetically,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.900]   unable to basically make progress on any actual work.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.160]   So on the other hand, if you say, no, no, no,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.240]   only these two things am I actively working on.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.200]   These are the only two things
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.760]   generate administrative overhead in your life.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.360]   That's very tractable.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.080]   So now you can really focus on these things,
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.600]   get them done fast, get them done well,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.880]   and bring something new over to the active slot.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.320]   The pace at which you complete things goes up
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.720]   when you reduce the number of things
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.180]   you're willing to work on concurrently at the same time.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.020]   All right?
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.860]   Key distinction here,
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.220]   you're not saying no to a bunch of things.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.060]   These are all things you're saying yes to.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.660]   It's just of the things you said yes to,
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.900]   you're distinguishing between
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.660]   this is getting my active attention
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.740]   or this is cued to get my attention.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.860]   I'm a huge believer of this.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.220]   I mean, there's a huge chapter on this
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.940]   in my book, "Slow Productivity."
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.940]   This really, along with what I talked about before
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.300]   with office hours, meeting windows, and project protocols,
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.040]   that plus work and progress limits
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.160]   utterly transforms the psychological experience
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.760]   of knowledge work.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.720]   It can really change it from this sense
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   of frenetic exhaustion where nothing ever gets done
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.100]   and it seems hopeless to something where it's calm,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.880]   it's even measured, and to the outside world
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.000]   it just looks like you're crushing it.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.280]   Thing after thing, you're just knocking out.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   It looks great, the work is really good.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.460]   All right, final idea.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.600]   One of the older ideas, actually, shutdown rituals.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.880]   When you are done with your workday,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.300]   you need a distinctive way of indicating
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.020]   that you're finished, some sort of ritual
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.200]   so that your brain can unload from all of its concerns
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.120]   and ruminations and machinations
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.280]   about your professional life so you can get a breather
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.500]   so that you can also find pleasure
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.000]   and be able to focus on other things in your life.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.880]   That's where shutdown rituals enter the scene.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.720]   Now, here's the idea.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.480]   When you're done with your workday,
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.660]   you need to go through and police your open loops.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.320]   What is anything right now that is open and unresolved
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.840]   that just exists in my head?
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.780]   I need to police all of these.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.720]   Make sure they get written down, they're in my calendar,
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.200]   they got put to my to-do list,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.320]   it's written on my list of things to handle
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.100]   during my first administrative block in the morning.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.800]   You get them all out of your head.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.360]   All right, now once you got those all of your head,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.780]   then you look at your calendar, you look at your inbox,
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.000]   you look at your weekly plan, you're like,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.600]   okay, now what's my plan for the days ahead?
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.920]   You convince yourself I'm not missing something,
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.860]   I've got a good plan,
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.340]   I have a sense of what I'm working on tomorrow,
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.340]   this keeps me on track for my bigger goals.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.460]   I checked my calendar,
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.360]   I'm not missing some urgent early morning meeting.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   I looked at my inbox,
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.540]   there's not some bombshell that landed at the end of the day.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.460]   Okay, everything is good.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.780]   It's completely safe for me now
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.580]   to turn my attention away from work.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.860]   And then you just need some sort of ritualistic way
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.620]   of indicating that you're doing so.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.940]   This could be a phrase.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.660]   I used to use the phrase, shut down complete
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.480]   or schedule shut down complete.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.820]   It could be something physical.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.260]   So if you use my time block planner,
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.020]   you'll notice every day on the daily pages,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.860]   there's a checkbox
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.900]   and it says shut down complete next to it.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.680]   That's how I do my shutdown ritual today,
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.400]   after I do this policing of open loops
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.200]   and checking in on my plan,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.420]   I check the checkbox next to shut down complete.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.260]   Now, the key thing is, after you do this,
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.540]   if your mind, as your mind probably will try to do
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.900]   from time and again, if your mind is like,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.220]   hey, let's just think a little bit more about work.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.660]   Hey, what about this thing coming up?
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.180]   Hey, let's kind of think through this email
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.980]   we might write to the boss tomorrow.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.520]   Do we really have a plan for whatever?
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.720]   I'm worried about that.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.500]   Instead of engaging in a conversation
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.260]   with this professional rumination, you say, wait a second,
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.700]   I did my shutdown ritual and I said the phrase
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.580]   or I checked the box.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.620]   I would not have done that
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.240]   if I had not systematically gone through all my open loops
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.380]   and my plan and my inbox and was completely convinced
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.860]   it was fine to shut down for the day.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.260]   So you know what rumination?
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.820]   I'm not interested.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.820]   I'm going to go back and do something else.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.900]   So you can respond to the rumination
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.060]   without having to get into the details of work
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.160]   that the rumination wants you to get into.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.180]   And as a result, you avoid falling down
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.520]   those anxiety producing internal narrative anxiety spirals.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.020]   You do the shutdown ritual enough,
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.700]   your mind just learns like, okay,
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.020]   this particular rumination gets no foothold
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.620]   and you get less of them
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.420]   and your enjoyment and presence outside of work increases.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.660]   All right, so there's a ton of other tactical things
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.840]   I talk about when it comes to productivity.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.220]   Like some things I didn't mention here
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.300]   was like how to organize your obligations
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.740]   using role specific task boards.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.740]   There's things like tactics like working memory.txt
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.800]   that I think are important.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.700]   There's the philosophy of full capture,
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.440]   which I think matters as well.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.660]   There's sort of evidence-based planning for projects.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.140]   There's the role of deliberate practice
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.220]   and career capital acquisition.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.660]   There's all sorts of ideas we talk about,
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.460]   but I think these five are kind of the basics
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.100]   that get you back in control of your life,
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.140]   especially knowledge work, right?
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.200]   So we have multi-scale planning, number one.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.620]   We have office hours, meeting windows
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.000]   and project protocols as number two.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.420]   We have deep to shallow work ratios
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.880]   as your like primary management metric as number three.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.900]   We have work in progress limits as number four.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.720]   And our final idea is implement shutdown rituals.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.940]   You do these five things, you got control.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.540]   And you're not gonna burn out.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.260]   And what you do with that control is up to you.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.580]   Again, you could try to crush it
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.280]   and make sure your startup becomes the best in the world,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.260]   or you can be like secretly getting away
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.300]   working a couple hours a day
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.780]   while you work on your stamp collecting hobby
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.860]   and your boss never knows.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.860]   You do you, but none of these options are on the table
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.860]   if your life is chaotic,
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.300]   if you don't control your time and attention.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.460]   These five things will get you a lot closer to that.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.420]   - I have two quick follow-up questions
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.260]   and then one longer one.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.660]   - Okay.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.940]   - The quick ones.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.260]   How many hours are in your workday for your time block?
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.260]   - I mean, for me, it's like roughly nine to five.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.140]   - So eight, okay.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:22.960]   - Yeah, roughly.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.980]   It might be 8.30 to five or nine to 5.30,
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.580]   but I keep my work within there.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.580]   - And then what's your ratio of deep to shallow?
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.820]   - 50/50 is good for me, if possible.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.340]   - So ideal four and four?
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.260]   - Yeah, that's like a standard.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.060]   I think in the summer I can do better
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.880]   and I wanna do better,
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.820]   but like that's the average I'm going for.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.220]   I say average because it depends on the day.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.460]   So like a teaching day, if I'm teaching two classes,
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.820]   if I count, what I'll often do is not to get like
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.400]   in the professor weeds here.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.140]   I often, I will count the lecturing as deep work
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.780]   for ratio purposes, because it is really hard, right?
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.300]   I mean, you're like producing a cognitive output
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.420]   that has value.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.340]   Now it's not like value that's scalable,
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.300]   like an article or a book,
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.380]   but still that's like deep work.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.220]   If I count the teaching itself as deep work,
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.700]   then like I can definitely hit the 50/50.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.740]   - Yeah, and then, okay, next final question.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.180]   With your active projects and your multiple jobs,
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.520]   how do you do the work in progress limits?
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.940]   - Yeah, no, that is a good question.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   So I kind of have work in progress limits per role,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.680]   because like the way I sort of multiplex these jobs,
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.260]   which by the way,
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.560]   should show you the power of these tools, right?
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.180]   Like I sort of have these multiple related jobs.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.740]   I just multiplex, meaning it's like, I divide my time up.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.080]   This is servicing this job.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.220]   This is servicing that job.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.940]   Well, imagine if you only had one of these jobs,
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.140]   you could be doing it.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.540]   Like my footprint would be relatively small.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.380]   If I was only doing one of these things,
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.760]   I would have quite a bit of time free.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.680]   So I use that as sort of an advertisement
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.540]   for controlling your time and attention.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.080]   You could do what I do and like, great,
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.620]   now I can fit three jobs.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.580]   Or you could do the opposite and say, great,
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.500]   now I can have my one job take up a third of my time.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.020]   I think there's a lot of power there.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.980]   I keep the WIPs basically per role,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.100]   but I keep them very small per role, right?
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.180]   Because they do add up.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.140]   - So like for writing, you're working on a chapter,
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.620]   for the podcast, you record an episode a week,
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.460]   and then for the teaching, whatever.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.140]   - Yeah, so for the podcast, those aren't projects to me,
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.980]   it's automated, right?
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.940]   It's autopilot scheduling.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.180]   Like the podcast, we have a half day a week,
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.060]   and I just think of it as like,
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.580]   there's a half day a week where we do the podcast, right?
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.620]   So there's not a project in progress.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.940]   It's an autopilot schedule,
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.940]   the same way that my workouts are scheduled.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.660]   In writing, I have a very strict,
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.420]   I try to have a very strict WIP
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.980]   that I keep towards one as much as possible, right?
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.820]   So it'll be like, I am doing this draft
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.500]   of a New Yorker article.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.780]   Okay, I'm done.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.500]   I'm doing a draft of this book chapter.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.380]   Okay, now I'm done.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.220]   Okay, now I'm going back and doing a draft
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.140]   of a new New Yorker article.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.980]   So I try to keep that one.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.420]   It goes to two when I have academic writings I'm working on.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.760]   So like, okay, I'm working on this academic paper,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.380]   that will overlap with like a non-academic writing,
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.620]   but I'll rarely be actively working
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.100]   on more than one thing at a time.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.300]   - That's actually technically two different jobs though,
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.140]   right?
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.340]   - Yeah, it's technically two different jobs, yeah.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.980]   But like I could, like if I was only doing,
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.040]   I mean, now I'm not as much a pure computer scientist
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.720]   anymore, more digital ethicist and technology theorist.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.180]   But back when I was doing pure computer science
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.180]   and writing books, if I was just doing one of those,
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.620]   I would probably, I could be like, hey,
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.140]   I'm working on these three academic papers
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.220]   at the same time.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.380]   But because I had this, I might be working on a book
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.260]   or a New Yorker thing at the same time,
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.100]   I would reduce that to like,
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.420]   I really should just be working on one,
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.220]   maybe two academic papers at the same time.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.380]   - Yeah, okay, it makes perfect sense.
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.300]   - They do influence each other a little bit.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.020]   Work in progress limit, by the way, is like the thing.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.540]   I'm thinking about like, if I was a manager
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.540]   or if I could wave a wand and add like new practices
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.940]   to managers and knowledge work,
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.700]   like what would be the most effective?
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.300]   Work in progress limits, I think would make a big difference.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.100]   If bosses were like, you got to write down
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.420]   what you're actively working on.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.100]   Everyone can see what everyone's actually working on.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.100]   It's on a board.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.780]   You can have like two things up there.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.580]   You can't bother someone about something
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.860]   that's not on that board.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.940]   Like that would make a huge difference.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.260]   And I think normalizing office hours
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.460]   and meeting windows would also make a huge difference.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.300]   Those would be the two things.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.380]   If I ran a company that I would be most interested
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.180]   in making sort of policies.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.380]   All right, so there we go.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.340]   It's a little productivity primer.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.420]   We got some great in the weeds productivity questions,
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.280]   but first let's hear from some sponsors.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.660]   This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.420]   So look, we just talked a lot about productivity,
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.500]   which is about controlling your time and your attention
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.980]   so you don't burn out and get things done.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.260]   But there's a flip side to this,
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.980]   a non-technical side of productivity,
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.980]   which is just the stress and anxiety
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.460]   that comes from all these things you have to do.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.820]   Work is chaotic.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.900]   Our lives are chaotic.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.260]   You work in an office job.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.700]   It's not like it used to be where what I do
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.500]   is I rivet engines on a plane.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.940]   You have an unlimited amount of things you could be doing.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.940]   You have to navigate this yourself.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.300]   You have to somehow balance your job
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.820]   versus the needs of your family
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.080]   and your other types of communities.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.340]   This is a source of anxiety.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.780]   This is a source of stress.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.240]   So just as much as we talk about productivity
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.540]   in this new distracted world,
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.860]   we also should be talking about mental health
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.260]   'cause none of this is gonna matter
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.100]   if you're struggling with your own head,
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.600]   if you're struggling with your own thoughts.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.580]   You yourself can be the biggest obstacle
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.260]   to actually sort of like a deeper life.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.860]   So this is where therapy can enter the scene.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.840]   Right, I hear this from our listeners all the time.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.740]   Having a professional help you improve the relationship
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   with your brain is really an important first step
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.700]   towards doing other interesting things with your brain.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.960]   So therapy really should be in the toolkit
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.040]   when we're thinking about productivity
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.380]   and crafting a deep life more generally.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.380]   So if you're thinking of starting therapy,
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.140]   you should give BetterHelp a try.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.380]   It's entirely online.

[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.880]   and suited to your schedule.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.420]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.200]   and you will get matched with a licensed therapist.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.720]   You can switch therapists at any time
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.760]   for no additional cost if you don't like
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   who you're paired up with.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.300]   So it's a very easy way to add this crucial tool
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.020]   to your toolkit.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.520]   So never skip therapy day with BetterHelp.

[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.520]   Also wanna talk about our friends
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.560]   and longtime sponsors at Element, L-M-N-T.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.420]   For years, I have been talking about the Element drink mix.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.800]   You can add your water to get those electrolytes you need,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.920]   especially after days of sweat,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.480]   be it like hard exercise or like I do,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.580]   a day of lecturing and giving interviews
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.780]   where you dehydrate yourself a lot by talking or teaching.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.760]   Element drink mix, you put in your water,
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.840]   it gets you those electrolytes, it gets you hydrated,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.160]   but with none of the junk.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.000]   There's no sugar,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.240]   there's no weird artificial ingredients.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   You can absolutely trust the quality of the product.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.120]   It just gives you what you need.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.160]   I use it, especially in the summer, basically every day.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.040]   Every time I work out, I'm often drinking it in the morning
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.740]   if I feel unusually dehydrated.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.960]   So we're big fans of Element here on the show.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.840]   They have a new product, which I'm excited about,
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.600]   Element Sparkling,
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   which delivers the same zero sugar electrolyte formulation
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.680]   you already know and trust,
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.520]   but now in a bold 16-ounce cans of sparkling water,
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.000]   you can just grab it cold from the fridge
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.680]   when you need that high quality hydration.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.440]   Element Sparkling offers health seekers
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.040]   and all new options support their health
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.200]   across a broad spectrum of occasions.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.160]   With each can, you can take a sip against sugar
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   and simulant loaded drinks,
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   turning the tides towards health.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.080]   So Element Sparkling is new right now.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.840]   It's available only to Element Insiders.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.680]   You can find out if you're an Element Insider or not

[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.220]   and I highly recommend it.

[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.540]   with any Drink Mix purchase

[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.280]   a bold 16-ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.740]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to some questions.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.820]   - All right, first question is from Luke.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.380]   I've been using weekly and time block planning
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.540]   to organize my professional life for some time now,
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.900]   and it's working great.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.380]   I have a second child on the way
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.780]   and still wanna be able to make modest progress
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.980]   on my non-professional pursuits.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.900]   Would time blocking be suitable here?
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.220]   - Well, I got a couple different thoughts here, Luke.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.860]   First, I wanna just give you some, a parenting thought.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.060]   So I'm a big believer from a productivity perspective
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.040]   in what I call simulated paternity leave.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.740]   So, I mean, if you have paternity leave, take paternity leave.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.780]   But if you don't, like a lot of people don't,
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.100]   you want to simulate this.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.300]   And what I mean by simulate this
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.300]   is you want to first of all reduce your work efforts
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.380]   back down to towards what I call
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.240]   the unnoticeable bare minimum.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.700]   So like down to this minimum
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.860]   where no one's really noticing.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.940]   It's not like people,
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.080]   you're actively saying I'm working less right now,
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.860]   but you're really keeping that work footprint
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.780]   as small as possible for about three months.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.460]   If you master the type of tools
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.580]   we talked about in the deep dive,
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.020]   you'll have a lot of control over this.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.740]   You can turn that dial down.
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.380]   Outside of work during this simulated paternity leave,
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.940]   you also want to redirect
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.260]   most of your non-professional energy towards family.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.620]   So like maybe you're still working,
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.820]   but now it's like, I'm working a bare minimum,
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.940]   I'm home early, like my energy is on like,
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.940]   you know, whatever, what my wife needs.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.580]   Probably in this case as a second child,
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.620]   it's gonna be a lot of like taking care of the first child.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.040]   And just be in that head space
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.340]   for the first three months or so, okay?
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.140]   You don't want when there's like a new child
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.180]   and it's really disruptive, but also really meaningful,
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:44.260]   it's not the right time to be trying to make sure
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.780]   you get your, you know, 10K run in
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.600]   because you're training for whatever.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.300]   A lot of people, especially a lot of guys
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.460]   sometimes react to the disruption
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.400]   and the sort of like existential shake up
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.500]   of a child arriving by trying to double down
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.980]   on like these things that are important to me,
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.780]   I'm gonna, I'm not gonna lose them.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.620]   You don't have to lose them in the big picture,
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.700]   but maybe for a few months,
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.900]   like that's not what you're all about.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.420]   Okay, so then beyond that, you're returning now,
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.620]   you can put your non-professional energy,
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.940]   you can put it towards some other outlets now.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.380]   Should you time block to try to make good progress
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.320]   on the things that are important to you,
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.060]   the leisure activities are important to you?
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.320]   I typically say no.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.300]   So here's how I talk about managing leisure activities.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.340]   They matter.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.820]   So you should have them in your strategic or quarterly plans
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.100]   like these things that are important to you,
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.600]   I'm trying to become whatever.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.140]   More knowledgeable about movies,
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.580]   I'm training for an athletic event, whatever it is,
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.780]   have those in your strategic plans.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.700]   Visit those then in your weekly plans, right?
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.140]   We talked about multi-scale planning, the deep dive.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.720]   When you're making your weekly plan,
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.220]   you're looking at these higher scale plans,
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.620]   you know, this is the time to integrate it.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.220]   Maybe there's some thing you have to go do
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.040]   that is gonna require a bunch of time,
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.820]   you wanna pre-block that on your calendar,
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.420]   like, okay, I need to go like
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.420]   buy this new athletic equipment.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.860]   I got time Friday afternoon,
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.020]   let me block that on my calendar.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.300]   So you can block off time
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.260]   for specific time-consuming appointments
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.880]   or things involved with your leisure activity.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.460]   You can have reminders to yourself in your weekly plan,
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.020]   like, hey, here's what I wanna make progress on this week.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.120]   You know, I'm gonna try to exercise most mornings
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.380]   or whatever it is, right?
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.860]   But beyond that, don't time block.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.060]   Like that's where I would put the end to the planning.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.160]   So now what happens when you get to a particular day?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.780]   Well, when your time block work schedule is over,
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.060]   you can then implement what I often think of
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.260]   as like non-urgent productivity,
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:43.020]   which is like do your best to choose interesting things
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.940]   to do with whatever free time you have,
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.380]   but don't sweat how much time that is
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.700]   or how much you fit in, right?
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.580]   So it's like, okay, I know what I'm working on.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.980]   I've blocked off times for stuff
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.060]   that really need to be on my calendar.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.540]   And then otherwise like, oh, it's the afternoon now,
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.180]   I have some free time.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.820]   Great, this is what I'm working on.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.820]   Let me go for a run.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.540]   Let me go like find a book on this thing
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.480]   that I'm trying to learn more about, right?
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.500]   But if I don't have a lot of free time,
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.540]   that's also not a big deal.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.620]   I don't have some sort of like hard schedule plan
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.180]   of like I need to get this many hours done on this or that.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.220]   So I'm a big believer in having a little bit more looseness
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.000]   around your non-professional pursuits.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.420]   All right, so the idea here is you're avoiding
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.740]   the stress of trying to follow a schedule.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.740]   Like time block planning is pretty stressful.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.620]   It's very effective,
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.740]   but it requires a lot of sort of concentration.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.560]   It's pretty urgent.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.620]   Like what's happening now?
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.820]   I need to get this done.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.020]   We wanna avoid that footprint as possible
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:38.940]   for your time outside of work so your mind can recharge.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.980]   On the other hand, for a lot of people,
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.260]   straight up free time's not the best.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.180]   Like we think having nothing to do
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.380]   is gonna somehow be what we need
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.440]   or that's gonna be rejuvenating and recharging,
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.280]   but for a lot of people, it's not.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.460]   So you do want to the extent possible,
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.760]   you are gonna feel better filling the time you have
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.520]   doing interesting, useful stuff.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.700]   So that's where this like non-urgent productivity approach
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.540]   comes in.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.940]   You have a great queue of things to do,
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.980]   but you're not sweating exactly how much you're gonna do
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:07.820]   and when you're gonna do it.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.820]   It's just like, hey, as I have time, let me do stuff.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.660]   I like doing stuff versus not doing stuff
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.740]   and I've got a pretty good plan of stuff to do.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.420]   And if it's 10 hours versus three hours versus 20 hours,
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.260]   like it is what it is.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.260]   You're just filling the time you happen to have.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.260]   So Luke, that's what I would suggest.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.400]   You don't wanna have nothing to do,
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.980]   but you don't wanna be over-scheduling
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.940]   the time you do have available as well.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.900]   All right, who got next, Jesse?
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.860]   - Next question is from April.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.900]   I'm a college student and I find it hard
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.020]   to fit all my activities and responsibilities
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.340]   into the 11 hours allotted by the time block planner.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.140]   So I often find myself scrambling
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.180]   with ad hoc work in the evenings.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.900]   How do I schedule a longer day?
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:48.520]   - Well, college students do have a sort of
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.340]   unique scheduling challenge
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.220]   because their work spreads out over a larger footprint
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.060]   than most jobs, right?
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.020]   So like most jobs, you can typically have something
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.320]   roughly like a nine to five
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   in the which you can constrain most of your work,
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.520]   but college students, it might be an evening block
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.340]   is a big part of your plan,
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.260]   or maybe you have an early morning class,
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.640]   you have activities in the afternoon,
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.500]   and you can really have a bigger spread of active time.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.320]   So this is a good question, this is a relevant question.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.720]   What I try to do, like what I tried to do
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   when I was a college student was to avoid the idea
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.980]   of the evenings and the late evenings
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.400]   were like your good open water to get things done.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.020]   I felt like there was a lot of usable time
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.240]   throughout the entire day
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.500]   that if you took advantage of that properly,
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.560]   you didn't have to lean too heavily
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.800]   on the like nine to midnight hours,
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.320]   the sort of wait to get work done.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.480]   In fact, I usually aim to be done with work by eight,
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.100]   which then gives you a schedule that does fit
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.760]   into like a reasonable time block plan.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.840]   Now, how is that possible?
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.860]   I mean, if you just said tomorrow,
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.960]   I don't wanna work past eight, you might be out of luck.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.120]   You're like, well, I have to have all this work
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.520]   that has to get done and three things are due tomorrow.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:05.040]   But long-term, how do you constrain your college work?
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.880]   Here's what matters.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.680]   One, and this is big picture,
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.140]   keep your course load and activity load reasonable.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.240]   The number one source of stress for college students
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.260]   is they have too many courses, they're too hard,
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.760]   they have too many activities going on.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.820]   If you're a college student,
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.280]   there's nobody in your future
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.280]   who is going to scrutinize the difficulty of your schedule.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.680]   That's something you felt like was relevant
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.160]   when you were applying to college.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.640]   It's not relevant for grad school,
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.840]   it's not relevant for jobs.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.960]   They wanna know where you went to school,
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.200]   what you majored in, what's your grades.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.020]   And for a lot of jobs,
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.040]   if you have other relevant experience,
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.360]   like you know how to program.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.680]   They do not know or care that your junior fall,
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.160]   you were taking five really hard courses.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.000]   Like that could have killed you work-wise.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.640]   No one knows, no one cares.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.800]   What'd you major in, what's your grades,
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.740]   where'd you go to school?
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.560]   So take advantage of that reality
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.060]   by keeping your course loads reasonable,
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.920]   don't overload courses, mix hard courses with easy courses,
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.480]   mix quantitative courses with other types of courses.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.880]   If you have credits that can reduce your course load
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.720]   for certain semesters,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.260]   take advantage of everything you have there.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.520]   So keep your course load reasonable.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.340]   Number two, use autopilot scheduling
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.920]   for all your regular work.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.280]   I have a problem set due every week.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.760]   When and where do I do the work for this problem set?
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.100]   I have an essay I have to respond right every other week
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.200]   for my English class.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.420]   When and where do I do the work on this essay?
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.160]   Start figuring out in advance
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.760]   where this work fits onto your schedule
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.700]   so you don't have to make scheduling decisions.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.680]   You're just executing this autopilot schedule
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.880]   and the stuff gets done.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.320]   When you do autopilot scheduling,
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.600]   this work gets done, a couple of things happen.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.400]   One, it starts to get done more in advance.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.720]   So it's not just what's due tomorrow.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.560]   Oh, I have a problem set.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.320]   Let me go work on that problem set tonight.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.840]   It gets done farther in advance
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.140]   so the work gets spread out more
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.640]   so it doesn't need to sit so much in the evening.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.120]   It also tends to get done earlier.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.000]   When you're trying to find,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.200]   when do I want to work on my biweekly essay
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.040]   for English class?
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.480]   That's where you realize like I have this hour gap
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.720]   between 11 and my noon class.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.280]   And if I use that gap on Tuesday and Wednesday,
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.880]   I could get my essay done.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   And so now suddenly work is getting done earlier in the day.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.000]   Whereas again, if you're just saying
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.160]   what do I want to work on next?
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.200]   Most students wait till they have the clear water of night
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.040]   to even start.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.400]   So you're better able to take advantage
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.340]   of the time that is available earlier in the day.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:19.520]   Adding onto that,
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.480]   time block plan your mornings and afternoons.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.960]   Do not waste the time
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.320]   that's in the morning and the afternoons between classes.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.920]   That's the good time.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.280]   That's when you want to be getting as much done as possible
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.600]   to minimize what needs to be done later.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.400]   When you do work, study in quiet places
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.640]   and don't do it without your phone.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.800]   And do it without your phone rather.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.900]   Here's where I do this work.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.800]   I go to this library.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.640]   It's very austere.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.960]   I don't bring my phone with me.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.480]   So it is full non-context switching focus.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.440]   Full non-context switching focus in a quiet place
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.560]   accomplishes work at roughly two times the speed
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.920]   of working with your phone nearby.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.440]   There's another big key
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.880]   to reducing the footprint of your student work
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.040]   is to work in full focus.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.800]   It makes a huge difference.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.040]   Trust me, your friends will survive
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.600]   if you're not answering their WhatsApp immediately.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.780]   Where am I at?
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.920]   One, two, three, four, okay.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.880]   Okay, number five, last piece of advice.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.680]   Make paper and exam studying plans.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.840]   This is an idea for my book,
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.360]   How to Become a Straight A Student.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.240]   It's coming up on its 20th anniversary,
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.640]   which is hard to believe.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.480]   20th anniversary.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.320]   - That's amazing.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.140]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.180]   I know these things.
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:28.140]   It's, you know, we've started looking through,
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.520]   started looking through my old student books
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.000]   and finding all the references
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.800]   that now there's references in these books
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.560]   that just don't make sense in like our current period.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.600]   Like just technologies that we don't use,
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.260]   like things we don't use anymore.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.160]   Just the world has changed so much
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.280]   that now we have to go back
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.840]   and start like making these sort of edits
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.200]   so that like the book is legible.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.000]   - So 20 years ago, there was,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.560]   I didn't have a telephone 20 years ago.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.320]   Actually I did, it was 2004.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:57.160]   I just got one.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.480]   - But there's no smartphones.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.320]   - Yeah.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.360]   - A lot of students didn't have laptops.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.560]   A lot of talking about like newspapers
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.220]   and going to the bookstore to find your textbook,
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.400]   like stuff that's like a lot more rare now.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.240]   It's interesting.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.920]   So we might go back and update some of those references.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.800]   Anyways, one of the ideas I had
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.060]   in How to Become a Straight A Student
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.880]   is at the beginning of your semester,
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.040]   get your syllabi and figure out where's my exams
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.800]   and where's my major papers and all my classes.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.960]   Let's get those on the calendar.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:27.320]   For each of those, go back and schedule on your calendar
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.200]   when you're gonna work on it.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.680]   So at the very beginning of the semester,
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.960]   you say there's gonna be a paper that's due in two months.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.400]   When am I gonna work on this paper?
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.040]   And now you start rewinding in time.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.440]   Well, two weeks in advance
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.680]   is when I really probably have to get all my research done
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.320]   and let me schedule out some time there to work on this.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.060]   And then one week in advance,
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:47.500]   I need to get my rough draft writing.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.640]   So again, you're spreading out work
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.560]   where there's space for it to fit reasonably.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.960]   So you don't have to say, I have an exam tomorrow,
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:56.800]   let me go study.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.200]   It's like, no, I just follow my calendar.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.440]   I actually started preparing for this exam three weeks ago
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.780]   in like reasonable bursts where time happened to be free.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.600]   And now as I get closer and closer to the actual exam day,
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.140]   there's not so much left for me to do.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.620]   These type of systems, these type of ideas and plans
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.800]   can keep your student workday much more constrained,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.360]   give you something where you rarely have to work past eight
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.600]   and now you can just throw standard professional
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.260]   office job style time block planning
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.760]   on the actual like morning and afternoon.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.480]   And this all sort of works out well, right?
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.060]   So that's usually what I recommend for students
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.840]   is some sort of mixture of that type of advice.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.680]   All right, who have we got next?
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.040]   - Next question is from Alexander.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.540]   I'm a head of one of the departments
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.380]   in a game development company,
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.520]   which by design means cross project work
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.920]   and a lot of switching between different projects.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.360]   I follow much of your advice.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.640]   I multi-scale plan.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.760]   I don't multitask.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.200]   I keep my phone away.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.400]   I say no often, but most of the days after work,
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.760]   I feel such mental fatigue, I can barely do anything.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.560]   Is there a way to better regain my energy after work?
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.680]   - Well, there's the easy answer and the hard answer.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.320]   So the easy answer is more tactical.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.720]   Okay, I want more energy after work, I'm too tired.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.180]   Two things matter there that can help some.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.080]   One, you want to make sure drawing from the advice
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.400]   from the deep dive in this episode
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.200]   that you have a good shutdown ritual.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.680]   A good shutdown ritual at the end of your day
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.040]   really does free up more mental resources.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.680]   The more your brain is actually holding on to things
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.600]   from the workday itself and kind of worrying about this
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.360]   and writing the email you need to send here
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.880]   and rehashing what's going on
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.740]   and stressing about the timeline
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.640]   for some sort of project that's going up.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.740]   The more your brain is doing that,
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.360]   the more your brain is going to be exhausted.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.800]   The less energy, cognitive energy will be left over
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.880]   for other types of things.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.080]   So have a good shutdown ritual will help a little.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.680]   Another thing that really matters here
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.160]   is getting as healthy as possible.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.820]   Physical health really matters
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.760]   when it comes to mental energy.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.340]   How you eat, how you exercise.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.480]   Now it might seem at first like,
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.660]   well, this is the last thing I want to do
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.880]   because this is another energy consuming time obligation
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.680]   I'm adding into my life that's going to make things worse.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.800]   It'll actually make things better.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.040]   If you're eating really well,
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.520]   you're getting in like a morning,
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.920]   like run or row or Peloton before the day gets started.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.600]   And then, and I highly recommend this,
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.000]   this is what I do during the school year.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.220]   You have a pretty intense resistance weight-based workout
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.400]   as your transition from work to non-work.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.640]   That does really well.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.320]   It kind of like resets your brain and your body.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.400]   You would think it would tire you,
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.560]   but it also kind of like switches you out of brain mode
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.440]   into body mode and it helps keep you strong
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.880]   and your muscles working in a way
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.720]   that just sort of keeps you more alert.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.800]   So it's like getting way more serious about your health,
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.240]   not just like a little bit, but a lot,
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.180]   that makes a difference.
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:49.300]   I mean, super high performing people do this, right?
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.960]   Like executives at these sort of,
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.080]   these high-end executives, hedge fund managers,
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.760]   where there's millions of dollars in the line,
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.920]   they're often pretty obsessive about their health
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:59.760]   because it matters.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:04.080]   Like it matters for, it matters for their energy, right?
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.600]   So you should care about that a lot more
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.520]   than you probably are.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:10.100]   The hard answer is some jobs are hard by design.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:12.520]   Like this might be a job,
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.120]   big company, department head, it's a prestigious job.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.380]   It might just be by design.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.340]   This is a really hard job.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.400]   That's what you're signing up for.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.760]   You got a lot of things you got to manage.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.800]   A lot's coming at you.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.280]   You got to be locked in like you are
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.760]   in all the types of stuff I talk about,
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.540]   to organize, control your time and attention.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.780]   Otherwise you're going to drown.
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.720]   But even with all those things, it's a lot
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.380]   and it's exhausting, right?
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.300]   That could just be the reality of your job.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.260]   Now, hopefully they're compensating you fairly
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.100]   for what they're asking.
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.740]   This is typically the case.
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.380]   Law partners are like this.
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:42.700]   That's a very demanding job.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.540]   But to say, hey, look, no surprises here.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.380]   We're paying you well.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:49.660]   You know what you're getting into, but this is what it is.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.420]   Consulting can be like that.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.860]   Clearly like startup founders can be like that.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.200]   C-suite jobs for companies can be like that.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.940]   Like these are very hard jobs.
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.260]   We pay you fairly for that hardness,
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.700]   but these are very hard jobs.
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.680]   They cannot be made into a low stress, not so hard job.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.040]   All right.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.820]   So if that's the reality here, which it probably is,
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.380]   there's some deeper questions to ask.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.900]   Is this the right job?
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.640]   The right way to approach this, of course,
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.380]   is with lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.180]   Don't just have some idea of a radical change
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.380]   and fall in love with change for the sake of change.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.900]   Get in touch with what is my vision of an ideal lifestyle?
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.020]   Like, what do I want my typical day to be like?
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.140]   Like where, what's the location where I'm living?
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.780]   What's the rhythm of the day?
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.940]   What does it look like?
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:32.780]   Where am I?
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:33.620]   What's happening?
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.860]   What's the feel of my work and my non-work?
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:39.020]   Am I walking my dog around a quiet lake?
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.700]   Or am I going to see a cool new filmmaker's opening
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.000]   in the city that night after going to, like whatever.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.460]   You just get this sort of concrete image
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.300]   of like what your ideal lifestyle looks like
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.020]   in the next five years or so.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.340]   Like the rhythms of the day, the feel of the day,
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.780]   the aesthetics of the day.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.980]   And you say, okay, how do I move closer to there?
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.900]   This gives you a much better way of assessing your job,
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:03.740]   right?
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.020]   And it might be when you do this,
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.740]   you say, what I'm really looking for,
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.080]   like what I want my life to feel like,
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.980]   this job is in the way of all of that, right?
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.260]   It's a completely different rhythm.
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.740]   It keeps me stuck in this location.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.660]   It prevents me from all these other things
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:15.500]   that are part of this vision.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.580]   I just don't have the time or energy to get there.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.200]   Now you have a strategic way to change that.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.460]   And it might be changing my job in such a way
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.580]   to find one that maximizes my access
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.700]   to these things I care about.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.620]   And it might mean switching to a job
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.940]   maybe within the same company that is less prestigious,
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.080]   maybe it's less money, way more solo and autonomous.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.940]   But that might unlock everything.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.780]   Well, I can do that remotely.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.600]   We can move here.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.300]   This fits much more controllable.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.580]   So this might be a good time in your life
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.560]   for some very careful lifestyle centric planning.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.460]   If you can wait a couple of years,
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.740]   I have a book coming out about this.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.580]   But in the meantime,
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.380]   you can go back and listen to our podcast about it.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.460]   This is a perfect case where you might find like,
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.900]   this job I took because it was
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.380]   what the prestigious thing to do was.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.400]   It's hard and I got it and I'm proud.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.380]   But it also makes everything else I care about difficult.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.540]   So lifestyle centric planning
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.160]   might be the hard answer to this question,
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.360]   but one worth paying some hard attention to.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.500]   All right, who do we got next?
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.300]   - Next question is from Jim.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.740]   I'm 27 and a management consultant
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.620]   and also pursuing my master's.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.980]   I use the time block planner,
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.340]   but struggle to enter deep work mode.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:26.020]   Each day I break my to-do list down into task size chunks
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.980]   and then allocate these tasks to time blocks on my planner.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.100]   Herein lies a problem, actually doing the deep work.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.460]   I feel like I have the correct systems in place,
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.400]   but still struggle with focus and procrastination.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.900]   - Okay, so first of all,
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.080]   there's a little bit of concern here
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.020]   because there's some terminology creep.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:48.980]   You talk about deep work mode,
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:52.740]   but now what you're talking about you struggling to do
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:57.540]   is tasks from your to-do list, right?
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.620]   So I think you're just like,
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.060]   you might be vaguely using the term deep work
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.860]   just to mean like doing stuff or being productive.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:06.100]   Deep work has a very clear meaning.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.740]   It's a particular cognitive state
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.060]   in which you're giving full attention
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.380]   without context shifts to a cognitively demanding task.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.740]   It's a state that is optimal for producing high-end output
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.220]   at a reasonable amount of time for demanding tasks.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.940]   It's a cognitive state.
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.220]   You're talking about more, I think,
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.740]   just you have a lot on your plate.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.980]   Your motivation is low.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.500]   You're having a hard time actually executing
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.340]   what's on your plan.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.940]   Whether it's a deep work block or a shallow block
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.660]   that's full of what you call task size chunks
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.540]   from your to-do list.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.280]   So I'm gonna put that deep work terminology off to the side.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.940]   What we have here is more of just like a time block
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.600]   planning execution issue.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:46.340]   So why do people struggle
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.940]   to execute whatever it is they have planned?
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.900]   There's a couple of things that could be at play here.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.580]   One, they don't buy the plan, right?
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.600]   Like they made the plan,
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.740]   but another part of their mind is like,
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.700]   what are we doing here?
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.060]   This is work for the sake of work.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:03.820]   Like our mind is very good at predicting the future,
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.200]   evaluating the future,
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.260]   trying to figure out if the action in the moment
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.640]   is moving you towards something that is worthwhile.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.680]   We did a podcast about this a couple of episodes ago
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.300]   where I talked about how the planning systems
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.940]   of the brain work and its connection to discipline.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.860]   So that's probably an important episode to listen to.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.700]   So for example,
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.340]   if you're just throwing a lot of work on your schedule
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.940]   and your mind's like, why are we doing this?
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.100]   Like this doesn't feel like it's really gonna prepare us
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.580]   for these tests or even like,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.540]   why are we doing this master's degree in general?
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.940]   It's gonna withhold motivation.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.580]   So you're gonna find motivation issues come
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.020]   when your mind is not on board
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.820]   with either the goal you're pursuing
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.120]   or the process with which you're pursuing that goal.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.180]   So it can help often to get much more specific about,
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.860]   okay, for my master's program,
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.360]   let me really get detailed about like the best way to study
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.900]   and to organize work and make sure that like,
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.460]   I really trust my systems and my mind's on board with it.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.860]   So that's one thing that can happen.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:01.420]   Another thing that can happen is just a,
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.980]   what I call deep procrastination.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.420]   I used to call that in my old
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.580]   student focused newsletter post.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.340]   It could be that your mind is just calling uncle
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.500]   on the plan in general.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.620]   So if what you're doing is hard
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:18.980]   and your mind doesn't feel on board with it,
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.500]   which typically is like an intrinsic,
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.100]   extrinsic motivation situation,
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.220]   the locus of control is cited externally from you.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.060]   It's like, I don't know,
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.580]   my parents wanted me to do this,
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.580]   or it just seemed like I would be
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.980]   an impressive thing to work on,
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.180]   but it's not really on board with the goal.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.780]   That mismatch can create what's called deep procrastination
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.980]   where like you really have a hard time executing work,
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.660]   even if you know like I'm committed to this work
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:39.660]   and I need to do it.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.380]   So deep procrastination requires
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.780]   more of a thorough investigation of like,
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.900]   why are you doing what you're doing?
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.340]   And when I hear something like I'm a master student
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.780]   at the same time that I'm a management consultant,
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.980]   and I hear I'm having a hard time
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.420]   actually executing my work,
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.980]   it might be because this really hard thing
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.820]   you're trying to do,
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.100]   which is two jobs at the same time,
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.500]   might not be as well planned out as you thought,
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.740]   and your brain is figuring this out.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.580]   And then it's like,
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:07.260]   why are we doing this like online master's degree?
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.100]   I don't know,
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.380]   it just felt vaguely like something interesting to do.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.580]   Like your mind is beginning
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.020]   to see the weaknesses in the plan.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.260]   And that might require a change
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.300]   to what it is you're actually trying to do.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.860]   All right, so those two things I want you to keep in mind,
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.300]   your goals or plan aren't well-developed,
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.980]   or your mind's not on board
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.540]   with what it is you're trying to do.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.380]   It's this hard thing,
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.980]   it's just not really worth it.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:30.300]   In terms of tactical solutions,
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.100]   make sure you're consolidating shallow task
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.740]   in the shallow blocks.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.420]   Make sure that your most cognitive demanding
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.060]   deep work blocks are earlier in the day
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.580]   when your energy is higher.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.500]   I would also recommend designating each day
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.540]   to be either a primary consultant or primary student day.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.700]   So if it's a primary consultant day,
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.980]   you're doing barely any work on your student work.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.460]   If it's a primary student day,
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.540]   you're doing bare minimum work for the consultant job,
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.260]   and most of your time is going to the student work.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.580]   So maybe you have two primary student days per week,
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.900]   as well as like a big Sunday block on that as well.
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.660]   And the other days are primary consultant week.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:10.660]   So you're not trying to really thoroughly mix
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.300]   two completely different activities throughout your day,
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.140]   going back and forth.
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.140]   That's too much context shifting.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:16.180]   So that might help as well.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.220]   Right, so there's a lot of different things going on here
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.180]   from your like fundamental sense of motivation
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.820]   to just tactically how you're organizing the work.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.260]   So hopefully some combination of those will help.
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.500]   All right, what do we have next, Jesse?
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.820]   - We have our slow productivity corner.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:31.660]   - Oh, that's exciting.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.900]   So as longtime listeners know,
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.460]   each week we try to have one question
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.220]   that deals with the topics from my new book,
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.460]   "Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.060]   "Without Burnout."
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.980]   If you like what you hear on the show,
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.060]   you need to read that book.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.820]   It's sort of like a Bible of sorts
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.300]   for a lot of our concepts.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.940]   So definitely check that out.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.780]   All right, so we've got
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.820]   our slow productivity corner of the day.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.540]   Jesse, let's get that slow productivity corner theme music.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.540]   (soft guitar music)
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:01.220]   Now we're ready.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.580]   All right, what do we got?
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.700]   - Hi, Robin has this to say.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.820]   I'm an early career academic.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.340]   I focus on high impact publications
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.980]   and often say no to less meaningful tasks.
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.420]   At the same time, I feel a great dissonance
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:18.000]   with academic evaluations and how we are measured.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.980]   Most evaluations leading to promotions
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.180]   will unfortunately be based
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.020]   on the number of author publications
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.540]   and to a lesser extent,
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.220]   taking into account the impact of these.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:31.060]   Am I shortchanging myself by obsessing over quality
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.380]   and not just publishing mediocre papers?
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:39.380]   - Well, Robin, I think at most high end R1 institutions,
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.460]   you gotta do both.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.300]   - Right.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.740]   - You need a sufficient quantity of publications
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.220]   that are also in really good places.
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.020]   So it's not necessarily a trade-off,
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.620]   it's just like a really hard goal.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.060]   My general advice here
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:56.860]   is working towards promotion in academia,
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:00.340]   you need to just work kind of relentlessly
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:03.340]   towards what it is that is valuable right now.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   Don't worry about if that makes sense or not.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.020]   Don't get upset about it.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.900]   Don't convince yourself it's somehow unfair
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.580]   or it's not measuring the right things.
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.980]   You can be worried about that post-promotion.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.420]   Pre-promotion, you have to see it
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.060]   almost like an arbitrary challenge.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.140]   I have to do X, what's the best way to get the X?
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.620]   And for, again, most research institutions,
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.380]   X is gonna be a sufficient number of papers
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:30.300]   in sufficiently good publication venues.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:33.700]   You need specific numbers for each of those.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.780]   Like how many is a sufficient number of papers for my field?
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:41.020]   What is the threshold for a sufficiently good venue?
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.180]   You get these by looking at recent successful promotion
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.340]   cases at your university,
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.780]   that's typically the best way to do it.
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.140]   So you have to have crystal clear targets.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.660]   Now, again, you can complain about these targets later.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.740]   You can rail against like,
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.380]   this is looking at the wrong thing
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.140]   and this isn't measuring what's valuable
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.820]   and you can pre-reduce dissidence about struggles
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.940]   or whatever you wanna do, do that all later.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.980]   Now we just want numbers.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:06.300]   This many papers in these places.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.820]   It's evidence-based planning.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.420]   All right, once you have those numbers,
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.820]   now we say, what's the most sustainable way to get there?
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.420]   And here's where slow productivity enters the scene.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.140]   All right, I really need to do six papers
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.420]   in these type of journals.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:21.300]   Now we can use slow productivity to get there
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.380]   in the most sustainable way possible, right?
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.500]   All the principles become relevant here.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:29.580]   Obsess over quality, super important in academia.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.620]   This means something very specific.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:36.220]   Papers that can get into venues of this level of quality.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.500]   Like that's specifically what this means.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.140]   And you have to figure out the reality
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.180]   of how does that happen?
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:42.300]   Do not write your own story.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.140]   You gotta work with collaborators
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.660]   who publish in those places.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.380]   You have to read the papers in these places
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.780]   and say, what is really needed to get a paper here?
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.820]   You have to obsess over that.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.580]   It's probably much harder than you think, right?
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.740]   So you have to obsess over quality
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.620]   when looking for a promotion.
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.580]   What about doing fewer things?
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.260]   Also really critical here, right?
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.900]   These are academically demanding,
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.300]   cognitively demanding things you're doing.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.420]   So your work in progress limits need to be really small.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.740]   It's like, I'm working actively on this paper
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:13.900]   and I'm preparing this paper and that's it, right?
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   It's like, I'm focusing really intensely
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.020]   on a small number of things.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.580]   As you were doing, keep doing.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.260]   I'm keeping my service obligations low.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.620]   I'm being a bit of a pain.
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.540]   I could be useful to the department after promotion.
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.420]   I could be useful to the university after promotion.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.180]   Now I have to get these papers.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.940]   You focus on a small number of things at a time
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:34.340]   and try to do them very well, critical for this period.
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.340]   What about work at a natural pace?
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.460]   Also critical, especially in academia,
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.940]   you need this sort of up and down intensity
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.300]   so you don't burn yourself out.
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.660]   So what I recommend, for example,
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.140]   is in the two to four week period
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:51.180]   following the submission of a paper,
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.140]   you have a severe wind down.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.100]   Okay, I'm really like cutting back for a couple of weeks.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.740]   I can do no work for a week at all,
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:58.980]   except for like my classes.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.820]   And then I'm just gonna be doing
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.620]   some like background thinking and conversations.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.780]   I am going to recharge and refresh,
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.460]   expose myself to ideas, get re-inspired,
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.740]   catch up on journal reading,
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.740]   finish working at three every day and go exercise instead.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.100]   Give yourself two to four weeks
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.780]   before you then begin like ramping up
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.700]   more intensely on the next paper.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.260]   So academics have to really lean into that seasonality
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:23.020]   to prevent them having a sort of brain exhaustion.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.220]   All right, so the three principles of slow productivity,
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.140]   not surprisingly, given that, you know,
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.820]   I'm an academic who has gone through all these levels,
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:30.860]   assistant to associate,
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:32.660]   the more recently associate the full,
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.500]   not surprisingly, there's a congruence
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.980]   between the principles of slow productivity in my book
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.820]   and what's necessary to be successful in academia.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.500]   So read that book, embody those rules,
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.540]   and make sure you're aiming
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.340]   towards a realistic assessment of what's needed.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:49.020]   Once you get 10, I'll commiserate with you all day
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.740]   about whether it's fair or makes sense or not.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.060]   But if you get obsessed on that story now,
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.060]   you're gonna get resentful.
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.380]   Your energy is gonna go towards like reducing dissidence.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.900]   I wanna just like really establish why the system is bad.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.460]   So if I don't get promoted, like I don't feel bad about it,
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.060]   that's all just wasted energy, right?
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:09.580]   Fair or not, here's what you need to do.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.020]   Let's use slow productivity to get there
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.940]   as sustainable as possible.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.180]   All right, Jessie, let's hear that music one more time.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:27.460]   - You know, slow productivity was selected,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.220]   I don't know if it was announced yet or not.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.620]   You know, the Next Big Idea Club,
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.100]   it's this company, it's like Gladwell and Dan Pink
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.300]   and Adam Grant, where you subscribe.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.340]   And every quarter they're like,
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.140]   "Here's the two best idea books of the quarter."
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.100]   And they send it to all their subscribers.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.940]   And they have this like long process of like,
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.580]   "Here's our nominees, then here's the finalists.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:48.900]   "And then here's like the books,
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.420]   "the two books we think are the best."
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:53.700]   Slow productivity was chosen for the club.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.540]   - Oh, wow.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.740]   - Yeah, so all the subscribers are gonna get
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.620]   a copy of Slow Productivity.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.540]   So there we go, those guys like that book too.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.900]   You gotta read it if you have it.
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:03.700]   All right, I think we have a call, is that right?
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.340]   - Yep. - All right, let's hear it.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:11.300]   - Cal, your content has been consistently excellent,
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.380]   so thank you.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:16.020]   Your book, Slow Productivity, was also outstanding.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:20.220]   My name is Etienne Huard, I'm a Benedictine monk,
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.700]   from whom you've actually answered a few questions before.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.540]   Thank you.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:26.540]   I use block scheduling as fast as possible
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:29.740]   and often teach it to students under my care.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:34.060]   Now, recently I've been noticing AI-driven calendars,
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.580]   calendars like Motion and Reclaim
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.940]   that use, I guess, a kind of block scheduling principle,
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.060]   but automatically based on settings,
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.620]   levels of importance, time, et cetera,
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:49.020]   schedule them in appropriate places.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.060]   So for example, if I cancel a one-hour meeting
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.180]   I was to have in the afternoon,
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.340]   the AI program would then fill that spot
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.660]   with a task that fits the timeframe and level of urgency.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:07.300]   I'm curious about your thoughts concerning such technology
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.700]   and its integration with the deep life
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.140]   and slow productivity.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.060]   Many thanks.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.700]   - All right, it's a good question.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.660]   I have been following these sort of AI innovations
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:20.940]   and AI scheduling.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:25.940]   If you are a practitioner of the type of ideas
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.500]   we talked about today in my deep dive,
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.500]   and in particular, multi-scale planning,
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.260]   AI-based scheduling systems
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.340]   are superfluous and unnecessary, right?
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.020]   It doesn't take that much time to build a schedule.
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:43.420]   It doesn't take that much time to adjust your schedule
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.580]   when something changes.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:48.660]   To automate all of that is saving you, at best,
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:52.780]   25 minutes in the course of a 40-hour workweek.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.860]   It's negligible.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.100]   What do you lose?
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.420]   The AI is way worse than you, right?
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.980]   I mean, think about our multi-scale planning philosophy.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.180]   You have these large, bigger ideas
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:06.340]   and visions for what you wanna do.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.700]   You have this weekly plan that kind of balances that
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:11.420]   and the other things that are going on in your week.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.260]   You have your view of the particular day
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.620]   and what you're trying to fit into that day,
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:18.140]   and you have all the subjective factors,
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.380]   such as how you're doing, your energy,
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.820]   how you're feeling, what's really happening,
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.260]   what else is happening in the world.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.460]   All these things come together
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:26.300]   to make your brain really good at saying,
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.420]   "Hey, how should I fill in this block that just got freed?"
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.700]   Or looking at your week and being like,
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:31.820]   "What do I wanna work on this week
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.620]   and when I wanna get it done?"
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.780]   Your brain is fantastic at that,
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.820]   and you gain very little by trying to automate it.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.460]   And more importantly,
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.220]   you want to be actively involved in your scheduling.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.700]   It's important for you to understand
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.220]   what you're working on, why you're working on it,
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.460]   how long things take, what your vision is.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.940]   To me, this sort of AI-scheduled future
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:55.900]   sort of personifies this sort of worst vision
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.740]   of widget-cranking reduction of knowledge workers
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:03.740]   to sort of assembly line stations.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.420]   It's this sort of worst pseudo-productivity notion
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.460]   of just like, "Be busy, more is better than less."
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.540]   And just, you always have to have something to do.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.380]   You're putting steering wheels on the Model T,
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.820]   you're putting the trunk door
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.540]   on the back of the Ford Tauruses.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.020]   It kind of reduces knowledge work
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.980]   into this more sort of just systematic,
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.100]   here's a new thing, crank, here's another thing, crank.
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.140]   And I see this more as like an opera.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.460]   There's different acts to it.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.060]   You're figuring out, this plays into my grand goal,
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.580]   and this is smaller, and you're playing with these pieces
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.660]   and trying to build this performance of your work week
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.180]   that is useful and beautiful and interesting
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:39.860]   and technically adept.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.900]   So I don't like this idea
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.580]   of having machines schedule things for you,
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.860]   and it doesn't solve a problem we have.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.380]   If we're listing the biggest hits
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:51.700]   to productivity in the knowledge workers week,
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.220]   nowhere near the top of that list
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.020]   are you gonna see time spent thinking about
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.540]   what to put on your calendar.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.700]   No, it's context switching.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.900]   It's the back and forth conversations over email.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.500]   It's the excessive meetings.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.540]   It's the administrative overhead aggregation
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.460]   that comes from having too many active projects
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:07.300]   on the same time.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.340]   These things are huge killers
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.420]   of your ability to concentrate.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.860]   They're burning everybody out.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:11.820]   That's what matters.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.940]   That's where, if we're gonna solve a problem with AI,
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.340]   solve those problems.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:21.620]   Learning that you like to do meetings at three on Tuesdays,
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:25.260]   like this is a solution looking for a problem.
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.700]   So I'm not that interested in those tools.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.100]   So I appreciate the question
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.580]   'cause there are a lot of those tools out there,
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:31.900]   and it's not something I would spend a lot of time
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.100]   thinking about if I was you.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.580]   All right, so we've got a good final segment coming up
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.980]   and getting to the books I read in July,
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.340]   but first let's hear from another sponsor.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.260]   So I heard a statistic, Jesse,
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.340]   that was pretty surprising to me.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:51.340]   Netflix has more than 18,000 titles in their library.
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:55.060]   But only something like 6,000 of those titles
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:59.020]   are available in the US.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:03.060]   So you are missing out on thousands of great shows
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:06.580]   when you are using Netflix in the US.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.540]   That is unless you are using ExpressVPN.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.860]   ExpressVPN is a product I've been talking about
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:12.700]   for a long time.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.300]   It's my preferred VPN.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.300]   You should be using a VPN in general.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.700]   It's a way to regain some privacy
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.820]   over what sites and services you're accessing,
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.180]   whether it's like at home
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.820]   and your cable provider is looking at this,
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.700]   or you're on the road
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.860]   and people are sniffing these packets out of the air.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.780]   But there's this cool other benefit you get
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.100]   from using a VPN,
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.980]   which is if you connect to a VPN server
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.180]   in a different country,
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:39.660]   you can gain access to services or content
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.020]   that's only available in that country.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.580]   So like, for example, on Netflix,
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.740]   I was messing around with this the other day.
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:50.380]   If you connect to an ExpressVPN server in the UK,
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.340]   there are some like really cool shows
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:54.060]   that are available on Netflix in the UK,
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.100]   but not in the US.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.460]   For example, like "Rick and Morty".
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.300]   It's a really cool cartoon.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.420]   It's available in the UK, not in the US.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.780]   The new drama, the FX drama "Fargo",
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:06.860]   the sort of the dramatization of the Coen Brothers movie.
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.060]   UK Netflix, yes.
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:08.980]   US Netflix, no.
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.820]   So if you just connect to a VPN server,
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.940]   an ExpressVPN server in UK,
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:13.780]   all that's available.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.700]   So it's kind of like a cool extra benefit
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.060]   you can get from using a VPN.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:23.500]   Now, as I've said, if you're going to use a VPN,
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.620]   I recommend ExpressVPN.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.460]   It's easy to use.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.300]   You just fire up the app
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.020]   and click one button to change locations.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:30.780]   It works on all of your devices,
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.740]   phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, and more.
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.820]   Super fast, right?
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.340]   They have a lot of bandwidth, fast servers.
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.060]   You can stream in HD through a VPN server
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.060]   with zero buffering.
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:42.500]   You don't even know you're using it.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.140]   It was rated number one by tech reviewers
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.940]   at places like CNET and The Verge.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.740]   And again, you get all these privacy benefits
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.980]   from connecting in an encrypted tunnel
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.900]   through a VPN server.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.180]   People nearby don't know what you're actually using.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.700]   Right, so I'm a big fan of ExpressVPN,
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.420]   both for privacy and for cool things
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.660]   like finding shows that aren't available in your location.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:07.160]   So be smart and stop paying full price
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.140]   for streaming services
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:11.020]   and only getting access to a fraction of their content.
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:15.500]   Get your money's worth at expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:19.940]   Don't forget to use my link at expressvpn.com/deep
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:24.040]   to get an extra three months free of ExpressVPN.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.580]   But I also wanna talk about my friends at ZocDoc.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.660]   Look, I'm going to the dentist tomorrow.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:35.540]   Got me thinking, how do you do things like find a dentist?
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.060]   Or like, let's say you need a dermatologist.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.340]   How do you find a dermatologist to go to?
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.580]   Let's say you need a podiatrist.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:41.580]   Your foot's hurting you.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.260]   How does one go about finding a podiatrist, right?
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:45.460]   I think for my generation,
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.660]   these are all these things that fall into the categories
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:51.800]   of like adult things that our parents just seem to do.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.240]   And now we have to do them
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.280]   and we have no idea how to go about it.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.540]   Well, this is where ZocDoc enters the scene.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.100]   It's an idea that makes so much sense.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.260]   I can't believe it hasn't been around longer.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.440]   ZocDoc is a free app and website
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.300]   where you can search and compare
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.200]   high quality in-network doctors,
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.820]   choose the right one for your needs
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:13.300]   and click to instantly book an appointment, right?
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.340]   We're talking about in-network appointments
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.620]   with more than a hundred thousand healthcare providers
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.380]   across every specialty from mental health
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.380]   to dental health, eye care to skin care, and much more.
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:25.020]   So like, look, you're looking for a dermatologist.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.900]   You can go on your ZocDoc app.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.240]   I could touch that.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.960]   You can go into your ZocDoc app and say, okay,
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.860]   give me a dermatologist near where I am.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.700]   Now let me filter this search.
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:37.300]   Dermatologist near where I am who take my insurance.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.100]   Dermatologist near where I am who take my insurance
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:42.860]   and are looking for taking new patients.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.140]   Now you get a couple options.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.340]   Now you can read the reviews.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.660]   These are real patient reviews.
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.500]   Oh, this one here, people really like,
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:49.860]   and there's a good chance you'll be able
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.200]   to then book your appointment right there
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.200]   using the ZocDoc technology.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.100]   It really makes finding healthcare quite simple.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:59.200]   I wanted to point out also
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.860]   that ZocDoc appointments happen fast,
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.420]   typically within 24 to 72 hours of booking.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:08.020]   You can even often score same day appointments.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:13.020]   So I have multiple healthcare providers who use ZocDoc.
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.980]   I have found healthcare providers with ZocDoc.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.940]   I have healthcare providers who use ZocDoc
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.500]   to help do like the, once you set up the appointment,
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.260]   to do like your pre-appointment paperwork.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.920]   So I'm a fan of this product
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.140]   and I think you should be as well.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.960]   So stop putting off those doctor's appointments
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.660]   and go to ZocDoc.com/deep
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.600]   to find and instantly book a top-rated doctor today.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:38.600]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.420]   All right, let's get now to our final segment.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.680]   All right, so every month
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.920]   in the first episode of the new month,
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.840]   I like to review the books I read the month before.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.120]   This episode is coming out in August.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.320]   So I will talk about the books I read in July, 2024.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.720]   I usually try to read five books per month.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.240]   I was up in my undisclosed location up North this summer
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.720]   during much of July, so I read seven instead of five.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.280]   So I got a little bit more done than normal.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.920]   All right, here's what they are.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.920]   Book number one, "The Revolutionary" by Stacey Schiff.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.160]   Each year around July 4th, I like to read a book
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.560]   that's about the American founding or a founding father
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.860]   or a founding father adjacent character.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.920]   So actually I started this last summer,
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.920]   but then returned to it and finished it this summer.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:30.480]   Stacey Schiff's biography of Samuel Adams.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.760]   We all know about his cousin, John Adams.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.160]   We know about the beer named after Sam Adams.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.640]   Didn't know much about the figure himself.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.360]   So I think Schiff did a great job
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.640]   of getting into the history of Sam Adams.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.000]   Heavily, heavily involved,
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.520]   especially in New England based revolutionary activity.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:53.760]   Then I read "Blue Meridian" by Peter Matheson.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.080]   All right, this is the account.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.720]   Peter Matheson is a reporter who embedded
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.720]   on a expedition in the late 1960s
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.520]   to find and film great white sharks.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.480]   Very little was known about great white sharks.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.240]   I mean, even just sharks in general,
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.720]   we didn't know much about in the '50s.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.480]   So not that much before this book came out.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.520]   Jacques Cousteau started going underwater
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.920]   with cameras and scuba gear and filming sharks underwater.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.040]   And this was kind of a new thing.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.840]   People were like, "Ooh, look at this."
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.800]   And then this particular crew,
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.960]   it was the son or someone from the,
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.080]   I guess the grandson of Gimbels
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.360]   from like the Gimbels department store fortune.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.400]   And some others set out to film great white sharks
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.280]   because very little was known about them, right?
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.160]   And they're like, "We're gonna get our first
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.240]   "like real footage of like great white sharks in action."
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.120]   They were sort of like the early innovators here
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.000]   of shark cages, like we're gonna get in water
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.280]   and film these things underwater.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.720]   They kind of invented some of the first shark cages.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.680]   And they went out to sort of find
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:57.960]   where are great white sharks.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.920]   Look, we knew very little about these back then
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.480]   and they wanted to find them.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.920]   And so this reporter came along with it
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.040]   and then wrote a book about it.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.520]   And I found the vintage copy of this book, "Blue Meridian."
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.880]   And it's a fun summer read.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.360]   Why is "Blue Meridian" kind of famous?
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.480]   Because it's the book and more importantly,
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.440]   the documentary that the book is about.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.640]   This documentary is what Peter Benchley saw
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:24.080]   in the early '70s and got the idea for writing "Jaws."
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.360]   So he saw the documentary that this,
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.720]   that came out of this expedition,
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.480]   which was called "Blue Water, White Death."
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.080]   And that's how he got motivated to like,
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.440]   "Ooh, I should write about white sharks attacking people."
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.680]   So just kind of these like interesting connections.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.840]   It was a fun book, well-written.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.520]   Peter Matheson's a good writer.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.080]   Speaking of aquatic themes,
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.320]   I also read a book called
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.000]   "History of the World in 12 Shipwrecks" by David Gibbons.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.040]   This was just an impulse buy.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:52.920]   I don't know where I got this from.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.840]   I think I got it from "Politics and Prose."
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.080]   He's an underwater archeologist,
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.600]   like a storied underwater archeologist,
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.840]   like has 40 years and has been involved
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:07.080]   in some of the major shipwreck dives of those 40 years.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.720]   The book is just, here's 12 shipwrecks,
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.440]   most of which he dived on,
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.000]   and he gives the history of the wrecks,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.560]   but also the time period in which that wreck came from.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.080]   And in doing so, you get kind of like a nice capsule history
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.960]   of important places and times in the history of the world.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.480]   So like, here's a Viking ship,
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.800]   here's an ancient Roman ship,
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.440]   here's, you know, up through like a World War II ship.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.680]   So it was a pretty cool book.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.080]   He's a dense writer, so I'll just warn you about that.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.160]   He writes, he's British and academic.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.840]   So man, like you have to go slow.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:44.840]   It is like, his sentences are like they're Byzantine, right?
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.560]   Like, he will, this secondary clause, tertiary clause,
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.960]   back to a secondary clause, back to the original clause.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.200]   And also he just references things.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.280]   So there's like a, even though this is a book
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.640]   written for a general audience,
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.160]   he's like constantly referencing things
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.000]   that he sort of just assumes you know about.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:04.840]   And you're like, what the,
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.520]   I have no idea who these people are and what's going on.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.680]   So very like sort of British historian type,
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.780]   but really cool guy and interesting book.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:14.440]   Another impulse read,
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.280]   I grabbed this on a bookstore in Vermont somewhere
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.280]   when I was up North.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.720]   This is Peggy Ornstein's book she wrote during COVID-19
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.720]   called "Unraveling," where she wanted to do all the steps
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.380]   of producing the yarn to knit her own sweater.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:32.840]   So shearing the sheep, changing the like,
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.880]   I don't know how you, spinning the wool,
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:38.760]   dyeing the yarn, and then sewing the sweater.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.760]   I sort of was in the mood for this sort of experiment
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.160]   in rural living type of book.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.080]   And Peggy Ornstein's a great writer.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.840]   So I read it, it was good.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.840]   I thought it was really interesting.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.920]   Sort of a lot of COVID era left politics in there,
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:57.440]   which kind of got a little annoying after a while,
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.680]   'cause I kind of cared more about like the sheep
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.280]   and the country life and the reconnecting to it.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.000]   And there's a lot of sort of,
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.880]   it was a reminder of the sort of peak COVID anxiety
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.120]   mixed in left-wing politics of that time,
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.640]   which I don't want to revisit.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.160]   So you're gonna get a big,
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.360]   you can get a big dose of that in that book.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:25.400]   Then I read Brian Rafferty's book, "Best Movie Year Ever."
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.720]   It's a period after every word.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.000]   It's a book about 1999.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.080]   It was epic movie year, this famous movie year.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.240]   All of these like really influential movies
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.060]   sort of all came out in this same year.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.200]   And so this book basically,
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.880]   it's one of these standard kind of like movie history books.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.720]   It just goes through movie by movie
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.840]   and you get a story about that particular movie
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.240]   before it moves on to the next.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.200]   So if you really want to get like a deep,
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.200]   not a deep dive, but just like this capsule look at,
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.400]   I think it was something like 15 or 16 movies he covers.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.120]   And as someone who likes movies,
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:02.960]   I was really interested.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.040]   You learn a lot.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.080]   You know, like what was going on with David Fincher
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.920]   and "Fight Club."
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:10.960]   What about the Wachowskis and "Matrix,"
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.920]   "The Matrix," which like came out in the same time.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.560]   All these other different movies that were all
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.120]   American beauty, like what was happening with Sam Raimi.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.760]   And so they could just fall into these different movies,
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.560]   these different histories.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.680]   And it was good.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:26.160]   It was good.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.120]   I'm actually right now listening to
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.280]   kind of like the original famous book in this format,
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.440]   which is like the best one,
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:35.520]   which is "Easy Riders and Raging Bulls."
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.720]   I might have that backwards.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.680]   About the '70s in movies.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.880]   That's a real, that's "Biscayne."
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.040]   That's a real famous one.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.880]   All right, I also finished "The Coming Wave"
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:47.160]   by Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.440]   It's kind of a wave-generating book,
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.480]   came out a year or so ago,
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.040]   where he was making his predictions
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.200]   about the future of AI and synthetic biology
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.720]   and how it was gonna have all these disruptions
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.840]   and what we can do about it.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.840]   And there's not really much we can do about it.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:02.400]   So one of these kind of prognostication books,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.160]   because Mustafa is the co-founder of DeepMind,
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.680]   he was coming from a place of authority.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.120]   Anyways, in my role as someone who writes
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   and thinks a lot about AI,
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.920]   it was just one of these things I needed to read.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:14.200]   And it's very readable.
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.280]   It kind of goes through and explains things
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.800]   and has some prognostications, a good book.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.720]   Finally, a fun book.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.960]   I read "Ready Player Two" by Ernst Kline.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.080]   I actually bought this for one of my sons
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.720]   when we were dropping him off at camp.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:28.560]   And I was like, "Well, I should read this
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.800]   before he gets back because I might be interested.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.280]   Also, I should make sure it's appropriate for him."
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.640]   And it was actually, Ernst Kline is good at these books.
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.880]   "Ready Player One" and "Ready Player Two,"
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.760]   there is an interesting amount of craft in it.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.120]   They're weird books, right?
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.360]   It's this super dense nostalgia.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.720]   It's not the most richly drawn characters,
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.440]   and he's not a great characterization guy,
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.800]   and there's a lot of internal exposition.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.840]   But somehow, he gets this rhythm going.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.800]   You're in this weird, fake world, literally fake world,
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:01.720]   and the stakes he sets up and how it rolls forward,
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:04.240]   plus just the complexity and the wonder of the world,
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.960]   and it presses a lot of nostalgia buttons,
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.560]   especially if you're a millennial or an old millennial
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.400]   like I am.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.400]   I know, it's hard to write these type of books.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.720]   I appreciate techno-thrillers,
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.000]   and Ernst Kline has done something new
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:16.960]   in the world of techno-thrillers.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.760]   So I enjoyed "Ready Player Two"
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.680]   more than I really thought I would.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:24.000]   All right, so those are my seven books I read in July.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.080]   All right, Jesse, I think that's all the time we have.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.920]   Thank you everyone for listening.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:31.240]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show,
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.880]   and until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.520]   So if you liked today's discussion
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.000]   about core productivity habits,
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.440]   you might also like episode 305,
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:45.320]   where I addressed the critique
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.920]   that time-block planning can seem oppressive.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.440]   I think you will like this companion
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.520]   in today's episode.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.560]   Check it out.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.120]   Anyways, with great care in tact,
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.280]   Berkman admitted that time-blocking
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.880]   does not work that well for him,
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:02.320]   and in fact, he feels like it is a little oppressive.
