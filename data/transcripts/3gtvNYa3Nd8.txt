[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.080]   for everyday life.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.660]   I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.200]   School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.580]   My guest today is Dr. Adam Grant.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.820]   Adam Grant is a professor of organizational psychology at the Wharton School at University
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.980]   of Pennsylvania.
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420]   He has authored five bestselling books and most recently has authored a new book entitled
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.680]   Hidden Potential.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.400]   He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University and his doctorate from the University
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.560]   of Michigan.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.520]   Today we discuss peer-reviewed studies and tools based on the data from those studies
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.360]   that can enable people to meet their goals and overcome significant challenges, including
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.240]   how to overcome procrastination, as well as how to see around or through blind spots,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.440]   as well as how to overcome sticking points in motivation and creativity.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.020]   We also discuss the research on and practical tools related to the underpinnings of performance
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.880]   in any endeavor, including how to increase one's confidence and how to have a persistent
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.220]   growth mindset.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.120]   By the end of today's episode, it will be clear to you that Dr. Adam Grant has an absolutely
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.640]   spectacular depth and breadth of knowledge, and that knowledge is both practical, it is
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.040]   based on peer-reviewed research, and he conveys those tools with the utmost clarity and generosity.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.060]   Indeed, by the end of today's episode, you will have more than a dozen new tools never
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.840]   discussed before on the Huberman Lab podcast that you can apply in your academic endeavors,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.320]   in athletic endeavors, in creative endeavors, in fact, in any area of life.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.800]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.440]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.200]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.580]   about science and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.500]   In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.480]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.340]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.140]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that getting a great night's
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.100]   sleep really is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.380]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that the temperature
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.280]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.820]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.480]   has to drop by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.380]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.040]   has to increase by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.480]   With Eight Sleep, you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment in the beginning,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.960]   middle, and end of your night.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.480]   It has a number of other features like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement and slow
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.680]   wave sleep that you get, things that are essential to really dialing in the perfect night's sleep
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.680]   for you.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.900]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for well over two years now, and it
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.560]   has greatly improved my sleep.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   I fall asleep far more quickly.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.040]   I wake up far less often in the middle of the night, and I wake up feeling far more
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.060]   refreshed than I ever did prior to using an Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.520]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, go to EightSleep.com/huberman.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.700]   Now through November 30th, as a special holiday discount, Eight Sleep is offering $500 off
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.880]   their bundles with a pod cover.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.180]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, the UK, select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.620]   Again, that's EightSleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.400]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.900]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.280]   you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.680]   One of the most important factors in your immediate and long-term health is your blood
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.200]   sugar or blood glucose regulation.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.260]   With Levels, you can see how different foods and food combinations, exercise, and sleep
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.980]   patterns impact your blood glucose levels.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.040]   It's very easy to use.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.400]   You just put the monitor on the back of your arm, and then you take your phone and you
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.320]   scan it over that monitor now and again, and it downloads the data about your blood sugar
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.920]   levels in the preceding hours.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.260]   Using Levels has allowed me to learn a tremendous amount about what works best for me in terms
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.960]   of nutrition, exercise, work schedules, and sleep.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.920]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.460]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.320]   Levels has launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.840]   the previous version.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.040]   Right now, they're also offering an additional two free months of membership.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.140]   Again, that's levels.link/huberman to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.120]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.560]   Waking Up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.360]   trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.720]   I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.960]   meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.320]   to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the Waking Up app, which could teach
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.800]   you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.880]   to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.580]   So I gave the Waking Up app a try and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.400]   I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.880]   And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.220]   different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.400]   of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.280]   I also love that the Waking Up app has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.700]   For those of you who don't know, yoga nidra is a process of lying very still, but keeping
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   an active mind.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.120]   It's very different than most meditations and there's excellent scientific data to show
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.900]   that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non-sleep deep rest or NSTR can greatly
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.720]   restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short 10 minute session.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.940]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app, you can go to wakingup.com/huberman and access
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.700]   a free 30 day trial.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman to access a free 30 day trial.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.280]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Adam Grant.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   - Adam, welcome.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.680]   - Excited to be here.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.800]   - We're very excited to have you here.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.860]   Your career, both public facing and academic career have covered an enormous range of topics.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.760]   So we have a lot to cover.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.140]   - Look who's talking.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.600]   - And anytime two professors sit down or even one professor says, we have a lot to cover.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.700]   I think everyone listening braces themselves like, oh no, but these topics, I assure everyone
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.740]   are of the utmost interest and you cover them in such both fabulous detail and you make
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.740]   it very clear.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.660]   So I'm really looking forward to this.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:38.040]   I'd like to start off by talking about something that I'm obsessed by and I know a lot of people
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.240]   are obsessed with and struggle with.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.940]   And I know you also have a recent publication on this topic, which is procrastination.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.200]   I am a bit of a procrastinator, but a different way of stating that is that I love deadlines.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.680]   I learned in college that I love, love, love deadlines because it seems to harness my focus
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.680]   and my attention.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.100]   I like just enough, I guess you call it anxiety or autonomic arousal for the neuroscience
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.300]   or physiology oriented folks.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.700]   For me, just brings about a total elimination of all of the distractors.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:24.980]   And it seems to both slow and accelerate my perception of time and it seems to bring out
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.320]   my best to have deadlines.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.120]   But I would prefer to not have to procrastinate in order to self-impose deadlines, I prefer
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.980]   that other people impose those deadlines in fact.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.180]   So what do we know about procrastination?
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.180]   Why do some people complete things well in advance?
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.080]   Why do other people procrastinate?
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.020]   Is it that they're seeking deadlines as I believe I am?
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:54.240]   And interestingly, and sort of alluding to this recent paper, viewers, what is the relationship
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.320]   between procrastination and creativity?
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.300]   - I feel like we should just deal with all that later.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.940]   Let's put it off.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.940]   No.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.940]   - Good one.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.100]   By the way, there's extra credit for science funds on here, so nicely done.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.660]   One of the best articles on procrastination ever written was titled at last my article
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.660]   on procrastination.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660]   - Fantastic.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.660]   I love it.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.660]   - Yeah.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.220]   It just made me smile.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.980]   So I think the basic question I think to start with is why do we procrastinate?
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.140]   And I thought I was immune actually when I came into this topic.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.180]   I was the person who annoyed my college roommates by finishing my thesis a couple of months
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.180]   early.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.740]   I found out there was a term for me.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.740]   I'm a pre-crastinator.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:41.340]   So the focus and the pressure that you get from a deadline, I get that the moment the
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.340]   project starts.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.140]   And sometimes months or years in advance.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.980]   And so I was really proud of finishing everything early.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.180]   And then I discovered there are things that I procrastinate on too, which was a little
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.180]   bit disappointing.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.860]   - Are you willing to share what some of those--
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.020]   - I am.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.840]   So I procrastinate on anything that's administrative.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   So--
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840]   - I'm right there with you.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   - You want to get time on my calendar?
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   - Yeah.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   - Okay.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   - So I procrastinate on things to respond.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   You asked me a question about social science.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.620]   I will be back to you in a minute.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.420]   I procrastinate on grading.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.420]   Takes me forever.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.260]   I basically put off a whole bunch of tasks that I thought had nothing in common.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.140]   It turns out that I procrastinate when I'm bored.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.820]   Boredom is, I guess it's probably my most hated emotion.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.920]   And so I will do anything to avoid a boring task.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.620]   And I think this goes to why people procrastinate, which is a lot of people think it's laziness
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.260]   or you're not disciplined enough.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.400]   But actually, the research on this is really clear that you're not avoiding work when you
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   procrastinate.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.660]   In fact, a lot of our procrastination is focused on doing things that involve a lot of energy.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.500]   You've seen people probably clean their entire houses when they're putting off a task.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.100]   So it's not that you're being lazy.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.580]   It's that you're avoiding negative emotions, that a task stirs up.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.100]   So for me, it's boredom.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.460]   For a lot of people, it's fear or anxiety.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.460]   I don't know if I can pull this off.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.560]   I have an extreme case of imposter syndrome in this role.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.940]   The challenge in front of me is too daunting.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.940]   For some people, it's confusion.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.380]   I haven't figured it out yet.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.940]   And so I can't work on this because I feel like I'm stuck.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.220]   So I guess the big question for you then, Andrew, is what's the emotion that causes
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.000]   you to procrastinate?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.160]   It's hard for me to identify the stick here.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.940]   I think of it more as the carrot that comes with deadlines.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.540]   And again, I don't consider myself a procrastinator per se.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:38.520]   I just really love deadlines and procrastination is a terrific way to simulate the deadline.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   So for me...
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.660]   So you wait, so you delay starting or finishing a task in order to have a sense of time pressure?
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.660]   That's right.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.920]   It builds a certain amount of internal arousal in me to know, "Okay, I've got 72 hours to
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.340]   complete something and it's now game time."
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.340]   I like the game time before the game time.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:04.420]   For a podcast, I'll put in anywhere from several days to weeks or even months in preparation.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.180]   So it's really elastic depending on the topic.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:15.640]   But when it came to exams in school, or if it comes to writing deadlines, I consider
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.420]   the shipping of the product or the presentation of the live event that I happened to be doing
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.920]   as the second game or event.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.660]   The first event is the pressure and the excitement of getting into the groove of doing focused
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.660]   work.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.660]   Because for me, that's such a drug.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:37.060]   I mean, it feels like having all the systems of my brain and body oriented towards one
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.100]   specific thing is just sheer bliss for me.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.560]   So it sounds like then you're actually not a chronic procrastinator.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.900]   Thank you.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.800]   That's never been the way I viewed myself, but now I'll take that.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.300]   It's a strategy for you.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.540]   It is a strategy.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.540]   That's right.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.500]   And I was fairly wayward youth, barely finished high school, et cetera.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.600]   So by the time I got serious about school, which was my second year of university, when
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.220]   deadlines were presented, like there's a midterm exam on a given date, that was exciting to
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.220]   me.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.220]   That was exciting.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.220]   It was like, "Okay, that's the big thing.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.100]   That's my opportunity to prove myself to myself," because I was really coming from behind.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.800]   And then the opportunity to, or I should say the feeling of dropping into that groove,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.980]   like this is the exciting part, is the preparation.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.380]   Likewise with podcasting, for our solo podcast, I love the research as much as I love presenting
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.380]   the material.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.380]   Maybe more.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.380]   Maybe more.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.380]   Right.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.780]   Likewise for university lectures or for traveling and giving seminars as a traditional academic.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.340]   I'm sure you're familiar with that, right?
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.340]   Of course.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.080]   Preparation is where you realize it's almost like, I think of it as somebody like a miner
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.980]   in a mine and just finding a gem.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.340]   And of course, then there are all the thoughts of what you can do with that later and you're
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.100]   going to show people it has a certain value to the world, et cetera.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.640]   But it's the searching and finding those gems that is like...
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.680]   Even as I talk about it, I feel like my body's going to float out of the chair a little bit.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   I have the same experience.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.480]   It's the unleashed curiosity and then the rush of discovery.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.700]   And by the time you're teaching it or explaining it, "But I already know this.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.420]   I'm not learning anything anymore.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.540]   And yes, I'm excited to share it and I hope it's helpful to other people."
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.660]   So I think as you talk about what your process looks like, I don't even think what you do
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.660]   qualifies as procrastination technically.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.980]   This is getting better and better.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:35.520]   Seriously, if you think about how procrastination is defined, it's delaying despite an expected
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.860]   cost.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.940]   And you don't think there's a cost.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.380]   You actually see a benefit.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.380]   That's right.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.380]   And I've tried starting...
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.380]   That's not procrastination.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.380]   That's just delay.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.380]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.300]   I've tried starting things earlier and I should say that my process often begins much earlier
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.260]   than the physical process.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.320]   If I was being observed in an experiment, it'd be, "Okay, Andrew's finally sitting down to
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:02.280]   write this book chapter or finally sitting down to research some papers for an episode."
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.140]   But I'm thinking about it all the time, much to the dismay of people in my life.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.900]   I'm constantly thinking about these things.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:14.020]   I mean, walking to take out the recycle, I'll have ideas and then I'll write them down.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.180]   I'm constantly writing things down, voice memos into my phone.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.460]   I have a method of capture where I basically try and just grab everything and then filter
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.580]   out what's useful.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.420]   Do you have a process like that for gleaning ideas?
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.420]   A little bit.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.420]   I do now.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:33.340]   So when Jiaxin and I started this research on procrastination, she had come to me.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:39.500]   She was a very creative doctoral student and she said, "I have my best ideas when I'm procrastinating."
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.940]   And it was one of those moments where I didn't believe her, but I thought it was an interesting
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.240]   enough idea that it was worth exploring and I said, "Show me.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   Let's get some data.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.180]   Let's see if we can test this."
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.900]   And she ended up gathering data in a Korean company where she surveyed people on how often
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.440]   they procrastinate and then got their supervisors to rate their creativity.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.500]   And sure enough, found that people who procrastinate sometimes were rated as more creative than
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.460]   people who rarely do, like me, the procrastinators.
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.460]   And I remember asking her, "What about the chronic procrastinators?"
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.180]   And she was like, "I don't know, they never filled out my survey."
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.980]   As I recall from that paper, there's an inverted U-shape function with procrastination on the
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.900]   vertical axis and creativity on the horizontal axis.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.900]   Flipped.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900]   Flipped, sorry.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.900]   Okay.
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.620]   So explain to me then the relationship between procrastination and creativity.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.620]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.300]   So basically the peak of creativity is in the middle of procrastination.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.300]   Ah, okay.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   Got it.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.620]   And yeah, there's an upside down U curve there.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:46.060]   And so then, I thought this was fascinating, so then we go into the lab to say, "Can we
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.060]   replicate this?
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.620]   Can we control it in an experiment?"
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.760]   And the hardest part of that was, "How do you randomly assign people to procrastinate?"
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.300]   To my knowledge, never been done before.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.040]   And we eventually figured out that we could give people a bunch of tasks to do and then
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.700]   tempt them with highly entertaining YouTube videos that were placed on their screen.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.260]   And we put different numbers of YouTube videos there so that if there's only one, you're
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.580]   not tempted to procrastinate much.
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.360]   If there are four, you're probably gonna get sucked into a little bit of a YouTube spiral.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.280]   If there are eight, you might be putting off the task that's much less exciting than watching
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.740]   Jimmy Kimball's mean tweets, for example.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.060]   And this was done in a fairly naturalistic environment for these folks?
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.020]   People are on a computer, they're asked to solve some creative problems that look pretty
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.180]   similar to what you might do in your job.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.060]   And then we're gonna score your creativity later.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.300]   And it turned out that the people who were tempted to procrastinate moderately ended
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.560]   up generating the most creative ideas.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   So why is that?
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.740]   There are a couple of things that happen and you have to look at both sides of the curve.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:53.980]   So what's wrong with the procrastinators and also what happens to the extreme procrastinators?
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.100]   And in both cases, what happens is you end up with a little bit of tunnel vision.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.840]   So when I dive right into a task, I'm stuck with my first ideas.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.100]   And I don't wait long enough to incubate and get my best ideas.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.660]   I'm less likely to reframe the problem.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.980]   I'm less likely to access remote knowledge because I'm just diving right in.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.420]   And meanwhile, the chronic procrastinators end up in the same boat because they don't
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.740]   get started until the last minute.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.080]   And so they have to rush ahead with the easiest idea to implement as opposed to really developing
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.700]   the most novel idea.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.380]   And meanwhile, the people in the middle who are starting to feel that pressure of like,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.860]   "Wow, I spun my wheels for 10 minutes watching a bunch of YouTube videos, I'm running out
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.120]   of time for this task," they still have enough time to work on the ideas that were active
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.460]   in the back of their minds.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.700]   And that gives them a shot at more novel ideas.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.420]   So I've tried to adopt this, to answer your question, I've tried to adopt this as my process
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.220]   now to say I will still dive into a project ahead of schedule, but I will not commit to
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.020]   an idea until I've let it incubate for a few weeks and I'm working on other things.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.740]   Whereas an earlier version of me, like when I'd sit down to write a book, as soon as I
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.160]   had the book idea, I would start writing on day one.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   Now I have the idea.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.980]   I file it away and I give myself at least a month before I begin drafting.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.440]   And I think it feels less productive, but it's far more creative.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:17.400]   - What are your thoughts about some of what you described being an unconscious way of
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.020]   seeding the mind and the unconscious with an idea?
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:27.240]   So for instance, let's take a school academic scenario where students get an assignment
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.680]   and the assignment is contained within a folder and it just says, "Assignment."
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.440]   And it's due in a particular date and it says due on that particular date and they're given
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.720]   the folder, but they have no sense of what the assignment is.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.580]   You can imagine one category of procrastinator that will take that thing and put it down
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.920]   and avoid looking at it entirely versus another category of procrastinator that will flip
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.100]   it open and take a look at, okay, this is going to be an essay on, I don't know, something
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.020]   about economic theory in the late 1700s.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.560]   Close it and then procrastinate.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.800]   There is an idea, which frankly I subscribe to a little bit because we recently did this
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.260]   series on mental health, not mental illness, but mental health with Dr. Paul Conte, where
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.080]   he talked extensively about the unconscious and how the unconscious mind is always working
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.240]   with ideas, things that we are concerned about, performance, these sorts of things, even if
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.960]   we're not aware of them.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.400]   What are your thoughts about the creativity that's seeded by slight procrastination being
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.140]   related to actually knowing what you're procrastinating on specifically?
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.620]   I think it turns out to be, I don't want to say essential, but critical.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:42.540]   So one of the things we found is in order for moderate procrastination to fuel creativity,
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.840]   you have to be intrinsically motivated by the thing you're procrastinating on.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   Interesting.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:52.240]   And so what happens is if you're bored, for example, by the topic, you're not going to
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.400]   open the folder.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.360]   You're not going to start thinking about it at all.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.800]   It's not going to begin, you're not going to do any subconscious processing.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.400]   You're not going to have any unexpected connections between this topic and something else you've
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.520]   learned about or been curious about.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.960]   If you're interested in the problem, then when you put it off, you're much more likely
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.400]   to still keep it active in the back of your mind.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.080]   And that's when you begin to see, I imagine you could explain the biology of this.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:30.680]   I imagine, for example, there are probably more neural networks that are connecting.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.640]   You get access to ideas that previously would have been sort of separate nodes.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.520]   And so I think that you want to know what the topic is, you don't want to just see the
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.800]   blank assignment, but you also have to find a reason that this is exciting to you.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.640]   Otherwise you're going to avoid it as opposed to letting it percolate.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.480]   That brings us to the topic of intrinsic motivation.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.680]   And I'd like to link that up with the topic of performance.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.720]   So when I was in university, there were many topics that I was excited to learn about,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.800]   some more than others, of course.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.700]   But occasionally I'd be in a class or I'd get an assignment that frankly I had minimal
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.800]   interest in, never zero, but minimal interest.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.700]   And as a way of dealing with that, I embarked on a process of literally lying to myself
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.040]   and just telling myself, okay, I'm super interested in reading this, and I'm going to force myself
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.420]   to be interested in reading it.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.220]   And lo and behold, I would start falling in love with certain things.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.900]   Maybe it was even the arrival of a word that I didn't recognize.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.940]   And then I would go look it up, and I knew I was studying for the GRE at that time.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.940]   So I had to file that away.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.980]   I still have my notebooks of all the vocabulary words that I learned in the course of my university
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:48.300]   courses that frankly made the verbal portion of the GRE pretty easy, which if you ever
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.060]   try and study for that at the end, it's pretty tough to commit all those new words to memory
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.200]   and context.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:59.020]   So I could find little hooks, and through those hooks, I could kind of ratchet my way
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.300]   into a larger interest.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.020]   And then lo and behold, I'm really interested in Greek mythology, or I actually liked that
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.860]   one at first, but I didn't have to trick myself.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:14.880]   But maybe we could spend a little bit of time talking about what is true intrinsic motivation?
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.480]   Is it always reflexive?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:24.980]   Can we make ourselves intrinsically motivated about a given topic, or scenario, or group
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.680]   of people?
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.940]   And then let's talk about how intrinsic motivation links to performance, because there's a rich
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.140]   literature on this, as I recall, and I remember the Stanford study of rewarding kids for things
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.860]   they were already intrinsically motivated to do.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.500]   Maybe we could touch on that a little bit and remind people who haven't heard about
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   it.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.420]   But I'm fascinated by this topic, because I feel like so much of life is about doing
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:49.380]   things that initially we don't feel that excited to do, and yet succeeding in life until you
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.500]   can afford to offload your administrative work to somebody else, which hopefully by
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.500]   now you have.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.620]   - Have to find a way to get it done.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.620]   - Right.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.700]   This is fundamental to being a functional human being, frankly.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.460]   Not just successful in air quotes, but functional.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.540]   We gotta do stuff that we don't enjoy doing.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.160]   - Yeah, so I think we can talk about a couple different ways to nurture intrinsic motivation.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.580]   We can think about how the task itself is designed.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.880]   We can think about reward systems, and then we can think about also the things we say
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:25.740]   to ourselves and others, which I hope are not lies, but rather persuasive attempts.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.900]   Let's start on that one, actually.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.260]   I don't know a lot of people who are that good at deliberate self-deception.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:37.980]   - Well, I like to think it was only around a particular set of goal-motivated pursuits,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.860]   but at that time, for me also, it was survival.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.020]   As I mentioned, I didn't do well in high school.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.580]   I really wanted to perform well in university, but I knew that working just for the grade
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.640]   wasn't going to carry me.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.740]   It felt catabolic, and I don't know.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.060]   Maybe at that age, I was still in the window of heightened neuroplasticity.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.920]   We know it never closes, but I think I also fell in love with the process of learning
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.540]   how to do what I just described.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.220]   - Yeah, so I think for most people, the best method of self-persuasion is actually to convince
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.220]   somebody else.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.620]   I'm thinking of Elliot Aronson's classic research on cognitive dissonance, where he would ask
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:22.720]   you to go and tell somebody else a task you hated is really interesting, and if he paid
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.180]   you a lot to do it, you still hated the task because you had a justification.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:32.640]   I got 20 bucks to kind of fib a little bit about this task.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.220]   The task is bad, but I did it for the payment.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.860]   When he paid you $1 to go and tell somebody that you loved a task that you didn't, you
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.380]   ended up liking it more.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.060]   - Wow, and maybe I shouldn't be surprised, but maybe you should tell me why I shouldn't
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.620]   be surprised, because I hope people got what you just said very clearly.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:56.080]   If they didn't, if you don't like doing something, going and reporting to somebody else how great
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:02.500]   that thing is, so lying about it to somebody else, is one way to increase the degree to
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:09.780]   which you like or enjoy that behavior or topic, and if you're paid $20 to go lie to somebody
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:15.360]   in the positive direction, so against your true belief, it's less effective in shifting
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.200]   your underlying affect about that thing, your emotions, than if you're paid less, correct?
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.900]   I think obviously in the experiment, lying was an easy way to show the effect, but in
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.460]   real life, I think the way that you want to apply this is to say, "All right, I've got
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.300]   to find something about this task that's interesting to me, and then in the process of explaining
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.420]   it to somebody else, I'm going to convince myself because I'm hearing the argument from
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.860]   somebody I already like and trust."
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:49.740]   I've also chosen the reasons that I find compelling as opposed to hearing somebody else's reasons,
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:55.320]   and so I think this goes to the point that you were making, which is if you're trying
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.600]   to find a hook to make a topic intriguing, you've got to figure out, "Okay, what is it
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.140]   that would make this fascinating to me?"
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.580]   And in a lot of cases, what you're looking for is a curiosity gap.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:11.000]   I think social scientists like to talk about curiosity as an itch that you have to scratch.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.960]   So there's something you want to know, and you don't know it yet.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.100]   So I would say, I tell my students often, "Take your least favorite class and find a
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.660]   mystery or a puzzle, something that you just do not know the answer to.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.880]   Actually, I've talked with our kids about this.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.180]   What really happened to King Tut?
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.180]   Do you know?
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.340]   Can you get to the bottom of that?"
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.840]   And all of a sudden, you're like, "I wonder.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.100]   I need to Google it, and then I need to see if Wikipedia has credible information on this."
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.700]   And the more you learn about that, the more intriguing it becomes, and I think that's
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.580]   the beginning of the process of finding intrinsic motivation.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.620]   I see.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:52.820]   So inherent in your answer is the idea that there's something wired into our neural circuits
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:00.860]   and therefore psychology, that curiosity as a verb, the act of being curious and seeking
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:05.980]   information where, well, and I should say, I define curiosity, and hopefully you'll disagree
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.940]   with me or agree either way, it doesn't matter as long as we can get a deeper understanding.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:15.500]   I define curiosity as a desire to find something out where you are not attached to a particular
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.500]   outcome.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   Yes.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.500]   Is that right?
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.660]   In psychology, it's typically defined as just wanting to know, and that means you're driven
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.300]   by the question, not a particular answer, which is exactly what you're driving at.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.300]   Okay, great.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.440]   And I think it was Dorothy Parker that said, "The cure for boredom is curiosity.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.420]   There's no cure for curiosity."
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.340]   As there shouldn't be a cure for curiosity.
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.940]   And by the way, folks, we don't know what neural circuits subserve curiosity in the
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.940]   brain.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.940]   It's got to be a distributed network.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.760]   There's no brain area for curiosity, but it's got to be linked up with the reward systems
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.820]   of dopamine, et cetera, in some way, because when one discovers something new that satisfies
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.940]   some curiosity, clearly there's an internal reward there.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.100]   Okay, let me back up.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:10.180]   So if your child or an adult is dreading working, exploring a topic or going about an assignment
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:15.140]   of any kind, you will give them a question that they then need to resolve.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.380]   What if the assignment is like rake the leaves off the front lawn?
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:27.900]   Do you say, "Count the leaves," or I mean, how does one get past the sort of procrastination
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.840]   and generate some intrinsic motivation for things that one dreads where it's unlikely
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.220]   that they're going to discover some knowledge that's exceedingly useful for the future?
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.040]   You always start with, "Okay, what's the first experiment I can run?
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.100]   Find the most interesting looking leaf for your favorite leaf, and then that lasts for
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.100]   about two minutes.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.100]   Okay, now what?
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.860]   We still have a lot of leaves there."
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.480]   I think not all tasks can be made intrinsically motivating to everyone.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.780]   And so when intrinsic motivation is difficult to find, what you want to substitute with
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.620]   is a sense of purpose.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:01.700]   Maybe a better way to say that is when the process is not interesting to you, you need
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.660]   to find a meaningful outcome.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:11.400]   So there's some research on the boring but important effect where kids who have a purpose
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.340]   for learning, this goes through high school, and think, "This is not just interesting to
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:21.920]   me, but I'm going to be able to use this knowledge to help other people one day."
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.940]   They're more persistent in their studying, they end up getting better grades.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.860]   And so I think intrinsic motivation is often driven by curiosity about the how.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.740]   A sense of purpose comes from really thinking hard about the why.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.140]   Why does this matter?
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.820]   And so I'd say with the raking leaves, let's try to connect that task to something else
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.440]   that you care about.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.180]   Are you going to pleasantly surprise your parents when they get home?
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:51.340]   Are you going to have a place to play soccer that you didn't before?
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:57.260]   And I think then the process of getting to that, I guess what I'd say is, if you're trying
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:01.760]   to motivate yourself, it's a little bit harder than if you're trying to motivate somebody
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760]   else on this.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.980]   If I was going to motivate somebody else, I would take a page out of the Motivational
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.820]   Interviewing Playbook, where I would say, "Okay, Andrew, actually let's place that for a second.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.900]   So you're going to rake a pile of leaves, it's a two hour task, zero to 10, how excited
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.900]   are you about that?"
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.900]   - A three.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.900]   - Three?
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.900]   Really?
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.900]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.900]   - I'm surprised.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.560]   Is it zero or one?
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   Why is it not lower?
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.620]   - I like any sort of physical activity because it allows me to move and I just like moving
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.620]   my body.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.620]   - There we go.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.460]   Okay, so you just identified a potential source of purpose for that activity.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.920]   And I don't have a vested interest in convincing you to do this task.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.580]   I am genuinely curious about what would motivate you to want to do it.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.180]   And as you start to articulate it, boom, self-persuasion kicks in.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180]   Love it.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.180]   - I'm going to start using these approaches.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.340]   - Try it at your own risk.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.480]   - As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course, our physical health, but also our
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.600]   mental health and our cognitive functioning, our memory, our ability to learn new things
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.740]   and to focus.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.520]   And we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.940]   sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimally
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:16.620]   processed sources, as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:20.500]   all the cellular functions in our body, including the gut microbiome.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:26.800]   Now I, like most everybody, try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods, ideally, mostly
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.820]   from minimally processed or non-processed foods.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.280]   However, one of the challenges that I and so many other people face is getting enough
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.780]   servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics that
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.100]   often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:46.020]   That's why way back in 2012, long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.640]   And so I'm delighted that AG1 is sponsoring the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.900]   The reason I started taking AG1 and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day is that
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.500]   it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.300]   That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:08.080]   probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:14.300]   If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.700]   You're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.580]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman to claim that special offer.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.860]   - I have a question about extrinsic motivation.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:40.620]   So if we grow up being incentivized by extrinsic things, you'll get your allowance if you blank.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.780]   You can spend the money that you make on your paper route doing the things you really want
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.780]   to do.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:53.960]   Is there any value in those kinds of learning based incentives for kids and for adults?
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.900]   Because I mean, that's the real world as well.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.980]   I know plenty of people, I have family members that only work for a paycheck and they're
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.020]   pretty okay because they like spending their paycheck.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.100]   Probably more than, I'm not intrinsically attached to money.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   I mean, I certainly have needs in life, but I don't enjoy spending money for the sake
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.860]   of spending it or for gaining more possessions.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.340]   But I know people that do and I certainly don't judge.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.700]   Are they somehow existing in a diminished landscape of happiness?
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.940]   Because they seem pretty happy to me, but they seem to have also worked out this relationship.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.280]   They do certain things to get the extrinsic rewards and they really enjoy what they can
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.360]   do with those extrinsic rewards.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.700]   So there's a huge body of evidence on what are the effects of extrinsic rewards on motivation
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.340]   and performance.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.380]   And I think the latest conclusions, if you look at the latest meta-analyses, so huge
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.160]   study of studies trying to accumulate, what's the average effect of adding a financial incentive
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.300]   to a task that wasn't incentivized before or to a job where you were paid salary and
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.280]   now we're going to give you incentive compensation.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   There is a boost.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:08.580]   So in general, people are more productive when they're incentivized for their output.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.940]   But these incentives are better for motivating quantity than quality.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.260]   So you see people get more done, but they're not necessarily more careful or more thorough.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.820]   Are they less careful and less thorough?
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.580]   No, actually, there's still positive effects on average.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.580]   They're just weaker.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.660]   And of course, you could then start to say, well, how do I incentivize being fast and
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.300]   careful?
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:36.380]   And I think where we do have to be really cautious is there's an undermining effect
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.360]   of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.200]   And you were alluding to this earlier, dating back to the early '70s, where we know that
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.080]   if we take an interesting task and then we pay you for it, you might conclude that you're
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.720]   only doing it for the outcome and you lose interest in the task.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.800]   So the classic demonstration, Mark Lepper and colleagues, is kids playing video games.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.280]   And they're playing them because they're fun.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.440]   And then you start to add in an incentive.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.020]   And then when the incentive is taken away, they don't want to play anymore because the
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.600]   meaning of the task has changed.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.180]   And now I'm doing it because I want to get something out of it, as opposed to I love
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.840]   the process.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.940]   I think that that phenomenon does not have to exist.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:19.440]   So we know, for example, at work, if managers, as long as they give people autonomy, they
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.400]   don't present the rewards in a controlling way.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.160]   So instead of saying, you know, Andrew, in order to earn this, you need to do the following
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.920]   work, if they say, hey, look, you know, I'd really love it if you, you know, if you would
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   deliver the following.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.620]   And in order to make that worth your while, I'm offering this incentive.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.720]   People react very differently when they have a sense of choice and control.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.360]   So I think that that's, I guess, the starting point.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.720]   In the presence of autonomy, I don't I don't think there's a major downside of extrinsic
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   rewards.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.760]   I think you also have to be careful that, yeah, I guess that you're not over justifying
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   the task.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.560]   In other words, you're not you're not swamping people's intrinsic reason for doing it, but
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.480]   you're adding a reason to try it.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.840]   So actually, if we if we go to a different domain for a second.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.940]   So look at kids who don't want to eat their vegetables.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.880]   Extrinsic incentives are very effective to get kids to try vegetables for the first time.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.000]   But then the hope is that they discover a vegetable or two that they don't mind.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.280]   And then they find reasons to keep doing it.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   And I think that that's how I want a lot of rewards to work.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.360]   I don't think that rewards should be carrots that we dangle to try to control people's
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   behavior.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.520]   I think they should be symbols of how much we appreciate and value a particular behavior.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.280]   If you frame them that way, it's a lot easier for people to say, yeah, you know what, I'm
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:47.560]   that reward is something that I really want, but I'm not only doing the task for that reward.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.280]   Yeah, that you basically answered the question I was going to ask, which is and your risk
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.880]   of sounding new agey, but we are sitting in California.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.840]   I could imagine that when one is focused on the extrinsic rewards, so physical task or
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.680]   cognitive task for an extrinsic reward, if I'm focusing on the extrinsic reward, I'm
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.760]   also air quotes again, not present, right?
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.620]   I'm thinking about the outcome.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.960]   I'm not thinking about process.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.000]   And I think there's, perhaps you can flesh out some of what this is exactly.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.040]   But I think there's a fairly extensive data to support the idea that when we are physically
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.400]   mentally present to the task that we're going to perform better and presumably our intrinsic
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.280]   liking of that task or performing that task increases as well.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   Is that true?
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   I think so.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.600]   If we want to break down the mechanisms for why intrinsic motivation is useful for performance,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.400]   one you touched on earlier, it's focus of attention.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.720]   It's much easier to find flow when you're intrinsically motivated.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.520]   You get into that state of deep absorption where time melts away.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:57.480]   So you mentioned sort of either speeding up or slowing down your sense of time.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.640]   You forget where you are.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.360]   Sometimes you even lose track of your identity and you're just merged into the task.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.280]   And so that concentration is helpful.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.120]   There's also a greater persistence effect that when you enjoy what you're doing, you're
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.660]   less likely to give up in the face of obstacles.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.700]   You're more likely to think about it when you're not doing the task and come up with
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.700]   great ideas.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.960]   And so I think there's a working harder, there's a working longer, there's a working smarter,
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   and there's also a thinking more clearly effect.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.960]   This is a brief but related tangent.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.760]   One of the things that I've found incredibly difficult in recent years is that most of
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.640]   my life, really since I was a small kid, I was forging for things and then I used to
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.360]   give lectures on Monday in class if they let me until they eventually stopped me about
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.100]   the stuff I was reading about all weekend.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.360]   So got an early start in the professorial front.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:57.340]   But now if I'm reading something and I discover what I think is a really valuable piece of
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.560]   information or a tool or a protocol, I'm like, wow, this is really cool.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.440]   These findings are oh so cool.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:09.100]   There's a problem, which is that now I have an opportunity to cast that out to the world
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.160]   through social media.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.460]   We all do.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.460]   This could be-
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.920]   - Wait, I'm sorry, you're on social media?
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.920]   - From time to time.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.420]   - You're all over my feeds.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.580]   - You and I both do our own social media, by the way, which I really appreciate.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.320]   I think one can always detect if someone else is handling someone's social media.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.280]   So yes, I'm on social media and I love that I have the opportunity to both send out ideas
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.220]   and information and also receive feedback.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.940]   I really love the comment section and always encourage comments.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.600]   I learned from it, frankly.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   - Love is a strong word.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.920]   - I learned from it.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   And you and I were weaned in the academic culture where frankly, the kind of hazing
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.540]   that one receives in academic culture is very different than the kind of hazing that one
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.160]   receives on social media.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.100]   But let's just say that if you come up through academia, you develop a pretty thick skin.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   - I agree with that.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.480]   I do have to say though that there was a part of me that was really surprised when I started
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.720]   posting on social that I love constructive criticism.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.860]   I was unprepared for the number of people who will knee jerk criticize a study without
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.780]   even looking at whether the methods are rigorous.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.300]   I'm like, come on, if I posted this, surely it's at least worth considering the possibility
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.980]   that there's strong evidence behind it.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:26.420]   - Well, that's where a brief, I want to call it a retort, but a response of, clearly you
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.160]   should read the study further because I think you'll be satisfied with the answer or something.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.740]   I don't know.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.740]   But I agree.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.440]   It can be a little bit harsh in there sometimes.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:42.240]   But the social media channels are, I think, it's a double-edged blade that obviously have
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.960]   their issues, but it can be a wonderful opportunity to share information and share it quickly.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.880]   The problem is that it takes me out of what I was doing initially, which was learning,
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.320]   searching for those gems which to share later.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.240]   And I think there's a broader landscape to consider this where people, for instance,
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.280]   are, I was at the beach yesterday.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:07.340]   It was just absolutely spectacular day at the beach, especially for this time of year.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.900]   And everyone was taking pictures of that experience on their phone and probably sharing that experience
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.120]   either social media or with friends.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.340]   This is very different than taking a photograph and not seeing that photograph until later
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.860]   or not sending it out.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:27.700]   And so there are now near infinite number of circumstances where we are taken out of
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.980]   the rewarding experience.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.320]   I should rephrase that.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.900]   We are taking ourselves out of the rewarding experience and focusing on a different rewarding
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.520]   experience that I think by definition is an extrinsic reward.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:45.400]   So we are taking ourselves out of our intrinsically rewarding experiences and activating these
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   extrinsic rewards.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.320]   And do you think in any way that's undermining our experience of things that we really enjoy?
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:57.120]   Again, not to demonize social media or these channels, but I've personally found it difficult
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:02.160]   to refrain from sharing this knowledge that I'm so excited to share, but I deliberately
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.160]   delay.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:08.840]   And I have a deep list of folders full of things that I want to post, but I'm just doing
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.960]   it systematically over time because I really fight the temptation to do this, mostly because
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.800]   I want to continue to enjoy this learning process and this seeking process so much.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.000]   Yeah, I feel the same.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I feel torn.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.480]   I think it was E.B. White who said, "I rise in the morning torn between the desire to
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.040]   enjoy the world and the desire to improve the world.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.520]   And this makes it difficult to plan the day."
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.600]   And I feel that every day.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.680]   I think, I mean, I even, I felt it this morning.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.320]   I was like, "Okay, it's time to leave to come to the Huberman podcast."
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:49.120]   I'm like, "Wait, but I didn't hit my minimum sunlight viewing.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.280]   So what do I do?
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.920]   Do I show up on time for you or do I meet your criteria?"
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:59.080]   The explanation I was getting my morning sunlight and therefore I'm X number of minutes or even
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.840]   hours late would have been completely fine.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.840]   I figured as much.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.280]   That's a built-in acceptable excuse with you.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:11.360]   I think, I mean, I think everybody experiences a version of this and it's definitely gotten
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.080]   worse with social media and with smartphones.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:20.260]   I think, so one of the most startling data points for me was Gloria Mark first put the
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:27.440]   process on my radar before COVID, the average person was checking email 72 times a day.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.180]   How do you ever concentrate for more than a couple of minutes if you're self-interrupting
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.180]   that often?
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.180]   You can't.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.540]   Brigitte Schulte has a great term for this.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.580]   She calls it time confetti.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.380]   And she says, "We're taking these meaningful blocks of time and we're slicing them up into
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.360]   these tiny little dots of confetti.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:51.500]   And not only can we not accomplish anything, we're also eroding our own sense of joy because
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:57.780]   it's really hard to enjoy the 30 second blip of time that you get on a task."
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:02.360]   And I think we know a lot more about the existence of these problems than how to solve them.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:07.560]   But one thing we do know is blocking out uninterrupted time is meaningful.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.580]   There's a great Leslie Perlow experiment where she takes engineers and she has them, she
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.380]   sets a quiet time policy.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:20.360]   No interruptions, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon, 65% above average productivity.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.100]   Could you repeat the protocol again?
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.720]   So quiet time, there are a couple of iterations of it, but I think the most effective one
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:32.280]   was Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, no meetings, no interruptions, no Slack, no emails before
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.700]   noon.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.980]   And during those periods of no interruptions, one could tend to whatever their primary purpose
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:39.980]   is at work.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.980]   So for me, it might be podcasting.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.240]   I don't have my phone in here, I never do.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.200]   But it doesn't mean no interaction with anyone else.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.560]   It just means focusing on the major task.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   The task, exactly.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.540]   And you come in with a clear sense of priority and purpose.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.240]   And I don't think there's anything magical about Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.800]   It's just the idea of setting a boundary and collectively committing to it that seems to
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.640]   be important.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:09.360]   And I think when I think about this, I'd be really curious about your take on chronotypes
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.780]   here, because I think one thing I've learned in the last couple of years is that if you're
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.260]   a morning person, you do your best analytical and creative thinking in the morning.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.700]   And so the quiet time block would work very well for me as a morning person.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.260]   If you're a night owl, you probably want that block in the late afternoon.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.860]   And I was encouraged, there was some evidence during COVID that people have their best meetings
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:36.660]   right after lunch, that they're something like 30% less likely to multitask in an after
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:37.660]   lunch meeting.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:45.720]   And I guess you could probably unpack the food coma, getting re-energized by other people.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.140]   But it's led me to wonder if we should all be protecting the first few hours and the
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:55.140]   last few hours of the day for deep work, and then doing our core meetings and interactions
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.340]   and kind of off-task activities in the middle.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.860]   What do you think about that as a sequence?
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.640]   Well, I have a lot of questions about this for you, but I love that sequence.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.560]   It certainly fits with my natural rhythms.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.060]   I think there's ample evidence to support the fact that provided one is sleeping well
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.320]   at night and is on a more or less a standard schedule.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.620]   When I say standard, I mean going to bed somewhere between let's say 9.30 and 11.30 PM, waking
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:26.460]   up sometime between let's say 6.00 AM and 8.00 AM, maybe 5.30 or 7.30, something like
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.460]   that.
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:32.500]   So not highly unusual night owl or super early bird.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:37.220]   For people that are following that sort of schedule, the first, let's just say from zero
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:44.940]   to eight hours after waking, there tends to be a fairly robust increase in all the catecholamines,
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.180]   so dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, which generally, okay, generally speaking,
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:55.700]   lead to increases in alertness, attention, and focus that are great for analytic work,
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.820]   great for implementation of strategies that you already understand, and you need to churn
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.100]   through a lot of stuff.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.060]   And of course there's a big increase in the morning, especially if you view morning sunlight,
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.300]   a healthy increase, I should say, in cortisol.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.740]   Cortisol is not bad, folks.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.680]   You want cortisol, but you want that peak early in the day.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   We know that.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:21.060]   Okay, so for most people, it seems, at least my understanding is that that period of time,
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:28.300]   zero to eight hours after waking or so, is best devoted to the quote unquote most critical
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:32.860]   tasks, but one of the common problems is that people take that ability to implement a known
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.900]   strategy and they start battering back all the emails.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.380]   Or talking to all, by the way, talking to coworkers is great and it's often required,
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.100]   but the question is whether or not it's a productive conversation or whether or not
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.100]   it's just conversation.
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.420]   And we tend to have a lot of energy early in the day, and I'm obsessed with the idea
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.600]   of neural energy as opposed to just caloric energy.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.100]   So there we're talking about neural energy.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:02.420]   And then post-lunch, so really as we get to this sort of nine to 17 hours after waking,
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.100]   there is a dip in autonomic arousal that during the middle of the day, that post-perendial
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.680]   dip, there's a post-lunch sleepiness that can be partially offset by delaying your morning
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.840]   caffeine a bit if you have the afternoon crash.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:17.540]   But it's interesting that you know that more productive meetings and less task switching
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:23.760]   and distraction occurred in meetings set after lunch, because that makes me think that perhaps
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:29.820]   being a little bit less alert is going to lend itself to more focus.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.740]   And indeed, that's the sort of optimal state, relaxed but focused.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:39.580]   You're not sleepy, but you also don't have so much intrinsic energy that you're tending
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.420]   to a bunch of things, because I think a lot of people do feel that way.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:48.900]   And I'm drinking double espresso right now, late mid-morning, late morning.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:54.040]   And I can sit still, but I think certain Zoom meetings, how do I say this?
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.380]   I don't want to offend any of my colleagues.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.600]   I mean, they are boring enough.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.360]   They are not content rich enough to grab all my attention.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.000]   And nowadays, of course, there are multiple screens.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.980]   Typically, I've got two phones and a computer, and you have to really spend some work to
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:09.800]   flip over those phones while I'm on a Zoom and things like that.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.800]   So maybe-
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   I'm sorry, what were you saying?
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   I was going to say.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:17.100]   So it's maybe the reduction in autonomic arousal that supports what you just described.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.740]   But I don't know.
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:25.120]   My thinking or my understanding, rather, was that creative work and kind of brainstorming
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.920]   was best accomplished in the late afternoon.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.400]   I've noticed when lecturing, I'd be curious what your experience is with in university
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.420]   lectures when I held courses in the evening.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:42.220]   I used to like to hold my courses 5 to 7 p.m. or even 7 to 930 p.m. when I was teaching
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:46.220]   undergraduates that people were much looser and more relaxed.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:51.180]   And I always thought that that might have something to do with an increase in GABA transmission
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:56.340]   that's known to happen in late evening, that people are just kind of more relaxed and less
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.340]   social anxiety.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.860]   They've been around people for much of the day.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.300]   I send back more reflections than answers.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.980]   I don't have any firm neuroscience explanations for what you described.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.620]   But there are some emerging theories about how that might work.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:12.460]   And it has this 0 to 9 hours phase 1, 9 to 17 hours phase 2.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.940]   And then, of course, from 17 to 24 hours, I'll call it phase 3.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.940]   You should be asleep.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.940]   Ideally.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:25.260]   Well, I think there's a confound in your teaching experience, which is undergrads often sleep
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.060]   in until, what, noon.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.540]   Or they might be up until 4 a.m.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.620]   Or at least 10 a.m. seems to be a typical rise time for the undergrad.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.860]   So a morning class might be too early for them to be fully awake.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:40.540]   But there is some brand new evidence that, at least on creativity at work, I read a series
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:45.940]   of three studies recently showing that early birds actually did do more creative work in
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.340]   the morning.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:53.580]   And in part, I think, again, I don't think any neuroscientist has touched the mechanisms
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.580]   on this yet.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:51:00.420]   But in terms of the psychological processes, early on, there seems to be a benefit of the
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.780]   energy level.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:05.180]   And some of that energy leads to more divergent thinking.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.220]   And later, if you're a morning person, you might lose the ability to diverge quite as
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.220]   much.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.020]   You're in a more conventional space of thought.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:16.420]   Does that track at all with your understanding of how it might play out in the brain?
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:22.120]   My understanding is it would be individual, but there is something to these liminal states
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.640]   between sleep and waking.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.860]   So maybe we can wrap a convenient bow around what I said and what you just said, which
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:36.460]   is that we know that in the transition states into and out of sleep, and it doesn't necessarily
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:41.780]   have to be within the first half hour in and out of sleep, that there seems to be more
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:47.080]   divergent thinking, or at least activation of neural networks that are not as constrained
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.460]   as one observes when they're in a sheer task and strategy implementation mode.
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.460]   Right?
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.460]   I mean, I think-
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.940]   Is that similar to the shower effect?
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.940]   The shower effect?
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:01.060]   So people have ideas in the shower, or while running, or while falling asleep, or my best
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.320]   ideas always come within the first hour after waking.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.420]   That's why I carry a notebook around, and to the dismay of people in my life, oftentimes
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:12.280]   I don't want to hear or talk to anyone first thing in the morning.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.460]   This is problematic, and I had to make adjustments.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:22.200]   We'll talk about adjustments between productivity and control and family interactions.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.940]   This is something I know you've worked on and written about.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:30.500]   But those liminal states are interesting, and I'd love your thoughts on this.
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:35.380]   I've had several guests on this podcast talk about their creative process, namely Rick
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:40.100]   Rubin, who's famous for his work in music producing, also has a great podcast, Tetris
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:48.220]   Grammaton, as well as Carl Deisseroth, a colleague of mine who's really in the 0.0001% of super
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:53.760]   talented bioengineers, neuroscientists, who also happens to be a full-time clinical psychiatrist,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.620]   and has five children.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.940]   Okay.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:01.980]   And I asked them about their creative process, because both of them are very creative.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.500]   Carl's process involves the following.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:08.220]   Late at night for him, but it could really be any time of day, deliberately making his
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:14.260]   body as still as possible and forcing himself to think in complete sentences.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:18.860]   Rick's creative process, although it includes a lot of different things, has a lot to do
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.820]   with also getting very still, lying down.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:24.820]   Okay.
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:29.540]   So many folks that I've spoken to, academics and artists, have referred to getting their
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.980]   body into motion, but quieting their mind.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.140]   So these are two opposite processes.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.960]   One case, the body is still, but the mind is deliberately very active.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:44.100]   In the other scenario, the body is very active, but they're making their mind in free association.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.180]   Not still, but they're not deliberately thinking about any one thing.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.180]   Fascinating.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.180]   And I'm obsessed with this.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.180]   Maybe you and I could work on this.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.180]   I'm due for a sabbatical.
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.700]   Maybe we could figure this out, because I think-
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.220]   I've never seen anyone study this before.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.220]   Right.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:59.140]   Because the nervous system, no, the nervous system, I'm not aware of anyone has done it
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.380]   formally either.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.720]   The nervous system, of course, is a brain body phenomenon.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:09.280]   And so what happens when we sort of cut off the deliberate operations of brain or body?
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.300]   And it doesn't seem to matter whether or not it's brain or body, as long as one is deliberately
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.680]   shut off.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.640]   And so anyway, I'd love your thoughts on this.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:22.020]   I don't consider myself like an ultra creative or creative type to any great degree, but-
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.020]   Me neither.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.020]   That's why I've been studying it.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:32.660]   Right, but I'm fascinated by these deliberate tactics that highly creative people have undertaken
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.340]   in order to bring about ideas.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:38.620]   I certainly have some of my best ideas when I'm running, and I'll just be running along
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.700]   like, "My goodness, I wasn't even thinking.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.580]   Now I need to write this down, okay, and then continue."
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:48.100]   I tried the Diceroth approach and the Rubin approach, I actually just spent a week with
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:55.500]   Rick overseas, and indeed he spends a lot of time just still thinking.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.140]   And it's a very hard practice to get consistent with.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:04.780]   I wonder if there are individual differences here on which needs to be stable or steady.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:12.060]   I'm thinking about a huge part of creativity is overriding your default instincts.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:17.500]   And if you're somebody whose default is to have your mind constantly going, then quieting
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:22.960]   would probably shift your train of thought to something more original or unconventional.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   The opposite might be true.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:30.180]   If you have a naturally quiet mind, I would imagine you need to jolt yourself out of that
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.920]   with lots of access to free ranging thoughts.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.180]   And so it'd be interesting actually to study whether we can predict what you should still
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.960]   based on your personality.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.240]   And maybe what we could do with that study, I think we have a collaboration brewing.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.560]   Here's a joke, two scientists walk into a room and what comes out is a collaboration.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.660]   So I'd want to put people in a scanner.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.440]   It's hard to get people treadmilling in a scanner because of movement artifact, and
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:02.720]   just look at resting network activation and compare that to resting network activation
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.900]   when people are completely still and forcing themselves to think in deliberate sense, and
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.660]   then look at the overlap in that Venn diagram.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:10.840]   That's what's of interest to me.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.920]   They may be completely different brain states.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.180]   They might actually have more similarity than differences.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:20.620]   I wonder then if you can tie that to differences in the quality and quantity of output.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:26.640]   So I would imagine that one of the benefits of either kind of movement is that you end
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:31.160]   up increasing the volume of ideas, which we know is good for variety and ultimately increases
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.860]   the probability that you stumble onto something new.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:41.000]   But then I think the being still part is probably better for the filtering process of...
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.380]   I think one of the hardest parts of creativity is actually judging your own ideas.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.120]   Most creative people have many terrible ideas.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   In fact, the most creative people have the most horrible ideas because they just have
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.760]   a lot of ideas.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:57:00.120]   And I think that maybe there's a way in which quieting either your body or your mind allows
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:06.240]   you to gain some distance from the idea and see whether it's boneheaded or promising.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:10.040]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.720]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:18.240]   and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.900]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:26.240]   many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.560]   from a quality blood test.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.000]   Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.040]   back about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.440]   with that information.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:41.560]   With Inside Tracker, they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.840]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones,
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.600]   et cetera, but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition,
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:54.580]   behavioral modification, supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers into
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:56.800]   the ranges that are optimal for you.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.440]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker, go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.040]   As a Cyber Monday sale, which will include Monday, November 27th and Tuesday, November
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.040]   28th, Inside Tracker is offering 50% off their full website.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:13.840]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:21.760]   - Along those lines, when one is trying to gauge the quality of their ideas, how do you
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:29.920]   cope with, or how does one cope with not placing a judge on that that causes some false negatives
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:36.640]   where you're wiping out great ideas because Rick Rubin talks a lot about don't give the
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.640]   audience what they want.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.640]   They don't know what they want.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   They haven't seen it yet.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.720]   If it's a truly creative idea, they haven't seen it, but of course we all have to develop
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.640]   our own sense of taste.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.200]   How does this process work for you?
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:55.200]   You've written about and worked on a tremendous range of topics and always, I must say with
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:58.760]   such rigor and such clarity of communication about those topics.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   - Thank you.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.760]   That's absolutely true.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   I mean, like 100%.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:09.360]   So we say around here, no weak sauce, you know, and there's no weak sauce in your game.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:10.360]   It's incredible.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   So when do you get your ideas and how do you filter those ideas?
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.440]   - I feel like the when could be anytime.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.720]   I think the, I mean, you've clearly experienced this too.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.240]   For me, the best thing about hosting a podcast is I have an excuse to learn about anything
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:29.500]   I want from almost anyone I want and I get to call that part of my job.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:34.380]   And so I feel like, you know, that having that built in mechanism for learning means
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:38.120]   ideas could come at any moment.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.200]   The filtering process for me is it's evolved over the last few years.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:47.520]   What I do now is if I'm, let's say I'm starting a new book, I'll write a draft of the first
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.840]   chapter and I send it to five to eight people whose judgment I trust.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.700]   And by design, some of those people are in my field, they're, you know, deep seated in
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.840]   organizational psychology.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.720]   Those are, you know, very far outside, but curious about the topics I'm interested in.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.520]   And I asked them for a zero to 10 score.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.020]   This is something I've learned to do as a springboard diver where, you know, I would
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:17.520]   take off and, you know, I'm doing a few flips or twists and I think my dive is good, but
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.160]   I can't see it because I'm hurling in midair and it's, everything's a blur.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.260]   And so I have to rely on my coach to tell me if it was any good.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.820]   I feel like creative work is the same way.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.140]   You're too close to it to know how the audience is going to react to it.
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.620]   And yes, you don't want to create it just for the audience, but at the end of the day,
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.000]   you want it to be, you know, interesting or useful to them.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.880]   So I asked for the zero to 10 and no one ever says 10.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.320]   And then I use that as a calibration mechanism.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.720]   So if everybody is in the seven or eight range, I know that I'm onto something promising and
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   now I need to refine it.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:55.980]   If I get a bunch of twos, threes, three and a halfs, I either need to rethink the idea
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:00.200]   or dramatically rewrite how I'm positioning it.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.780]   And I think one of the mistakes a lot of people make is they know they need feedback on their
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.780]   ideas.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:10.280]   They go to one or two people and they start to feel a little bit defensive or threatened
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.640]   and their ego gets involved and then they don't ask for any more.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:18.400]   What they don't realize is it's actually less painful if you get more feedback.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.560]   Because when eight different people critique your work, you start to realize that a few
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.380]   of the comments that sort of bruise you a little bit, we're just idiosyncratic and no
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.720]   one else cared about those issues.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.960]   But then five people had the same problem like that is not taste.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.680]   That is a quality issue and I've got to focus on that.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.700]   And so it really helps to filter what are the, what are the revisions I need to make?
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.560]   What are the problems and complaints I need to pay attention to versus what can I ignore?
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.520]   Because maybe this product was not for that person.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.600]   I'm recalling when I was a postdoc, I had a manuscript fully prepared and I worked in
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.960]   a laboratory where I didn't work on the same thing as my postdoc advisor.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.860]   He was very gracious in letting me be the outlier.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.680]   And he said, well, I don't know anything about this topic.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:06.200]   So before you submit it to this fairly prestigious, very frankly, very prestigious journal, I'll
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.200]   be honest.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.240]   You should probably go down the hall and hand it to so-and-so.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.540]   I don't want to mention who it was because I'm still in the same department.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.020]   And I gave it to him, this individual.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.700]   And he looked at it and he said, yeah, you know, it looks interesting, but I don't think
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.800]   there's going to be a whole lot of interest in this.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.580]   It's just like not, I was like, no way like this, I think this is really cool.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.580]   But I was pretty dismayed.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.180]   So I was like, oh God, so what do I do?
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.920]   So I went back to my advisor and thankfully he's a bit of an iconoclast and he said, that's
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.560]   the best feedback you could have gotten.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.140]   Definitely submit it to that particular journal.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:42.040]   And I must say that paper got accepted faster than any other paper.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.520]   I've never had an experience like that.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.920]   I mean, it required some revisions.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.660]   I remember thinking like, wow, what an unusual response to after having instructed me to
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:57.240]   go ask a more senior colleague at that time, assistant professor, and then to get the essentially
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.400]   negative response and then to take that as like, you should definitely send it out.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.760]   Really taught me a lesson that sometimes one needs to invert their action according to
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.080]   the negative feedback they get.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.960]   Not always, but that was an N of one, okay?
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.680]   So it's not, shouldn't be extrapolated to too many circumstances, but basically led
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:23.720]   me to not seek out feedback prior to submission of things terribly often.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.160]   I mean, I check information obviously prior to podcasts.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.120]   I check the validity of the information in podcasts and papers, but it made me realize
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:38.900]   that people's opinions can be like highly idiosyncratic and in some cases outright wrong
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:44.160]   and really the opinion of the journal is what mattered most in terms of getting it accepted
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.160]   or not.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.520]   So how do you, you said give it to the greatest number of people, but if it's anything like
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.980]   comments on social media, there's a salience to negative comments.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.480]   So how should we filter positive versus negative feedback?
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.520]   Well there's a meta-analysis here.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.560]   This is Kluger and Dinesi looking at 100 years of feedback research and they found that what
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.420]   drives the utility of feedback is not whether it's positive or negative.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:14.020]   It's whether it focuses on the task or on the self.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:19.800]   So if I tell you that your work is terrible, you're going to get defensive.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.980]   If I tell you that your work is great, you're going to get complacent.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.760]   If I tell you here's the specific thing that I liked about your work, you're going to try
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.940]   to learn to repeat that.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.460]   And if I tell you here's the thing I didn't like, you're going to try to see if you can
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.980]   fix it.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:39.020]   So I actually think we should worry less about whether the feedback is encouraging or discouraging
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:43.540]   and more about how do I make sure that I get input that's going to allow me to learn from
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:47.100]   my strengths and also overcome my weaknesses.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.780]   And actually one of the things I've learned recently is there's some, I would say a growing
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.020]   body of evidence at this point that asking for feedback is not the best way to get people
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.660]   to help you.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.420]   Because when you ask for feedback, you end up getting two groups of people.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.620]   You get cheerleaders and you get critics.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.420]   And cheerleaders are basically applauding your best self.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.060]   Critics are attacking your worst self.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:11.460]   What you want is a coach, which is somebody who helps you become a better version of yourself.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.660]   And the way you get people to coach you is not to say, "Give me feedback," because they
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.260]   will then look at the past and tell you what you screwed up or what you did right.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.760]   What you want is to say, "Can you give me advice for next time?"
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.200]   And then they look at the future and they'll give you either a note on something to repeat
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.800]   or something to correct.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.300]   And this is such a subtle shift that it can make a big difference.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:36.140]   Andrew, one of the things I guess I found myself applying this to a lot is after giving
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.140]   speeches.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:40.460]   I used to get off stage and say, "I would love some feedback."
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.660]   And you get back a bunch of, "Oh, you know, I really enjoyed that.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.660]   Thanks.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.140]   What do I do with that information?
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.120]   I'm trying to learn how to get better."
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.380]   And when I shift the question to say, "What's the one thing I could do better next time?"
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.200]   It's like, "Oh, don't open with a joke.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.020]   The audience couldn't tell you were joking."
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.720]   Frequently it's, "Give me a little bit more of a through line.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:06.180]   You focused a lot on a bunch of interesting points, but I lost the connective tissue."
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:09.500]   And those actionable suggestions are much more likely to come when you just ask for
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.860]   a tip as opposed to an evaluation.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.460]   - Oh, that's so good.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:17.180]   I'm going to just pause for a second.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.180]   I've never taken a pause.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:25.780]   I've taken occasional pause to be honest, but they're very rare as the audience knows.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:35.100]   So, that's just gazillion dollar advice because I think that everyone has an ego.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.500]   We all want to perform well.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:42.220]   We'd like to perform better over time and negative feedback hurts and it can hurt a
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:47.420]   little or a lot depending on how defensive we are, but a tool like you just described
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:54.260]   to remove some of that defensive armor that we all have and actually let the information
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.920]   in in a way that's constructive is really great.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:02.880]   What you described I think is a way to create constructive criticism, but the constructive
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.020]   part is really coming from within as opposed to saying, "I'd like some constructive criticism,"
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.820]   and then hoping that the criticism is actually constructive.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:15.340]   So you're taking control over the process in a healthy way, in a benevolent way.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:18.500]   - That's the goal and I think the big question that comes up for a lot of people at this
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:23.380]   point is, "Okay, so I get somebody to give me advice, but it might still sting.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.420]   How do I get better at taking it constructively?"
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.880]   And I think probably my favorite technique on this I learned from Sheila Heen, she calls
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:36.500]   it the second score, and the idea is that when somebody gives you a piece of criticism,
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.500]   that's your first score.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:43.380]   So let's say in my world they gave me a three and a half and I want to know how I can do
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.380]   better next time.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.260]   How do I get myself to focus on that?
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.740]   What I do is say, "I want to get a 10 for how well I took the three and a half," and
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:51.740]   that's the second score.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.620]   I want to evaluate myself on how well I took the first score.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.940]   I think about this almost every day.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.420]   There was, actually, can I tell you a quick story?
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:07.460]   So when I was right out of my doctorate, I got asked to teach a motivation class for
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.900]   Air Force generals and colonels.
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:16.220]   I was 25, I think, 25, 26.
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.760]   They're all twice my age.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:23.940]   They've got thousands of flying hours, they've got billion dollar budgets, they've got, well,
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:27.860]   you know this community well, their nicknames are Stryker and Sandoon.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.900]   And I was extremely intimidated.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.420]   So I walked in there and I thought I had to impress them, and I started talking about
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:38.880]   my credentials and all my research experience, and the feedback at the end of the four hour
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.920]   session was brutal.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.740]   I remember reading the feedback forums and one person had written, "More knowledge in
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.840]   the audience than on the podium."
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.240]   I was like, "True, I can't argue with that."
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.480]   And then another wrote, "I gain nothing from this session, but I trust the instructor gained
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.980]   useful insight."
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:58.980]   And that was devastating.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:04.820]   I was like, can I, I would really like to transform into an actual bear and hibernate
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:09.020]   for the next four months, and then maybe I'll come out of a hole ready to hear this.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.320]   I didn't have that option.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.560]   I had committed to teach a second session a week later.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:18.200]   So all I could do was figure out how am I going to hear this feedback and really take
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.200]   it seriously?
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.420]   And I guess I applied a version of the second score and I said, "All right, there's some
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:28.420]   generals that are going to come back and see me again, and I've got to prove to them that
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.540]   I was open to feedback."
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:36.100]   And one of the things I heard loud and clear was that they valued humility, and I had led
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.580]   with too much confidence, which was just insecurity massed.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:44.520]   And so I thought, "Okay, how do I change the equation?"
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.300]   And walked in, looked at the room, and I said, "I know what you're all thinking right now.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:53.600]   What can I possibly learn from a professor who's 12 years old?"
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   Dead silence.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.160]   I'm like, "Oh no, this is going to go horribly wrong."
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.680]   And then one of the guys in the audience jumps in and is like, "Oh, that's ridiculous.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.600]   You got to be at least 13."
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   Everybody started laughing.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.240]   It broke the ice, and I think what I was trying to do was to take myself off the pedestal
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.780]   and say, "Look, I heard your feedback.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:17.900]   You told me that you didn't think I had anything to teach you, and I've got to acknowledge
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.860]   that right up front and be open to the fact that that's true.
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.560]   And so I want to come in here and learn from you, and I want to see if I can curate a conversation
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.820]   where we all end up learning."
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.460]   And the feedback was night and day different.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.540]   Afterward, one person wrote, "Although junior in experience, the professor dealt with the
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.860]   evidence in an interesting way."
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.300]   I was like, "All right, I'll take it."
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.700]   And there was something really powerful about saying, "Look, I can't change the fact that
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.080]   they hated my session.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.620]   What I can do is convince them that I was motivated to learn from their criticism."
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.880]   - I love this concept of the second score, and thank you for sharing that story.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:58.220]   I think very often we hear about people like you who, if people didn't catch the math in
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:02.040]   there, you were a PhD by age 25.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.900]   And as far as I know, the youngest tenured professor at Penn at 28.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:11.260]   So these are outrageously impressive metrics of accomplishment.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:17.380]   But for you to share a story about less than optimal performance and how you adjusted to
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:23.940]   it and the incorporation of the second score that you're referring to, I think is really
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:31.900]   appreciated because I think that as much as we hear, "Oh, Jordan took many more free throws
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.100]   and everyone just thinks about all the ones he made," people think about all the ones
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.100]   he made.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.100]   That's the way the game works.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.100]   That's the way the mind works, I should say.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.620]   So I appreciate that you've fleshed it out with a personal example.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:47.880]   I too would want to turn into a bear and disappear, but I think that it's really impressive what
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   you did.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.900]   And it makes me think that the second score of getting a ten at bringing the three and
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:12:03.020]   a half up, as it were, is really about turning a score into a verb process.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:06.540]   Over and over again, as I do this podcast and as I've taught in the classroom, what
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.800]   I keep coming back to is this idea that we should be focusing more on verbs and less
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.060]   on nouns.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:16.220]   We love to name things and categorize them, but when we start living life through a lot
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:23.700]   of verb processes, so instead of being fit or running as a thing, we really think about
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.700]   just running.
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.860]   It becomes less daunting and we accomplish far more.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:32.220]   But the idea that, and there are mathematical models of this, I'm sure, but what you're
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.380]   basically talking about, you know, like an integral, right, as opposed to just some value,
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.380]   right?
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:38.100]   You're talking about the slope of the line, right?
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.660]   So you're a three and a half.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.660]   How are you going to get to a ten?
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.620]   Gosh, that's a huge gap and you're dealing with being back on your heels psychologically
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:48.920]   from getting all this, you know, battering feedback from these, you know, these highly
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.980]   accomplished individuals, all these instruments and, you know, literally wearing them presumably
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.740]   on their body for you to see.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:00.620]   And it's really about creating, it's about taking control of the slope of that line from
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620]   the three onward.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.940]   And it's really a forward-looking perspective.
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.700]   So I don't think we're being unduly psychological here or analytic.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:13.520]   I mean, I think it's really about taking a moment state and a noun and turning it into
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520]   a verb.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520]   Yeah, I think that's right.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:21.660]   I reminded a great philosopher, Homer Simpson, who said that verbing weirds language.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.260]   So it's harder to talk about this stuff in verbs.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:26.700]   I swear I didn't steal it from the Simpsons, but if it came from Homer Simpson, like I'm
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.700]   all for it.
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.940]   You have to, I mean, that's incredible.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:34.420]   Small brain, but, you know, given the size of his brain and people have seen the image,
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.580]   you know, fairly robust knowledge.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.100]   No, I think you're onto something.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.660]   I think verbs are active and we're drawn to them.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:46.100]   I think, yeah, a lot of times people review their past work and they just like, they end
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.380]   up shaming an earlier version of themselves and they wallow in rumination.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:55.060]   And what we want to try to do in that situation, which is easier said than done, is to say,
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:00.620]   like the purpose of getting feedback or advice is not to shame my past self, it's to educate
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.480]   my future self.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.580]   Which I think is very connected to a lot of the work on growth mindset that you've been
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.580]   talking about.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:11.340]   And there's been a firestorm of controversy around can we teach growth mindset in schools
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.340]   lately?
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:18.300]   And I think what that has underscored for me is, like, you can't expect someone to listen
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:23.400]   to one podcast episode or go through one workshop and magically believe that they're capable
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.620]   of learning anything at any moment.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.240]   This is something we have to actively work on on a daily basis.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.720]   And part of doing that, exactly as you said, is thinking about this loop and saying, all
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.780]   right, the person that I'm, you know, I'm competing with is my past self and I want
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:39.140]   to get a little bit better today than I was yesterday.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:45.980]   Yeah, I think along the lines of growth mindset, obviously we both know Carol Dweck and I respect
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:46.980]   her tremendously.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:52.860]   And I realized there is some controversy now around how readily one can teach growth mindset
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:53.980]   or incorporate growth mindset.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:59.360]   My understanding, and I'd love to know your thoughts on this, is that when the Dweck work
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:07.000]   is combined with some of the Ali Krum work, that is, growth mindset is combined with a
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.160]   knowledge, just a basic and true understanding that stress and the feelings of anxiety and
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.000]   tension that can actually be performance enhancing.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.360]   When those two things are combined, I think this is the work of David Yeager and colleagues
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:29.480]   at UT Austin, that indeed growth mindset becomes more visible in our mindsets and performance.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:35.780]   And are there other aspects to growth mindset and other mindsets that are now being woven
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.060]   into that framework that can be helpful?
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:42.460]   Because I know, gosh, if ever there was a great name for a area of psychology, growth
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:46.500]   mindset tells you everything you want, everything you need and everything you sort of need to
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:53.360]   know in just the name, but we all find it difficult to implement.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.520]   Just telling myself I'm not as good as something as I could be yet, it sounds great.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:04.960]   But in moments of receiving feedback that's harsh, sometimes it's hard to access.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960]   Yeah, it is.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.060]   I think so the latest, there's a McNamara et al meta-analysis.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:15.640]   And then I think sort of that camp versus the Carol and David camp have very different
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.340]   views on how big the effects are.
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.940]   But I think one thing they seem to agree on is growth mindset is more important in circumstances
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.180]   where people are more likely to need it.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:34.260]   So if you think about, for example, kids who are impoverished or marginalized communities,
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:42.600]   the message that you are capable of evolving your skills to the point that something you're
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:47.140]   bad at today, you could be good at next year, is really important when you've never heard
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.420]   that before.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.360]   And when you don't have a single person believing in you.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.520]   I think where we're often missing the boat is we think, all right, I'm just gonna instill
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.300]   this idea in a person's head and my work is done.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.140]   And we know that the context around you really matters.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:06.780]   So actually Carol's done some research showing that growth mindset is more likely to have
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:13.040]   an impact when your classroom culture and your teacher has the belief that kids are
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:19.480]   capable of learning and growing, that your starting ability is not fixed in any subject.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.040]   And I think probably for all of us as individuals, what that means is we need to think about
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.200]   the micro environment that we put ourselves in.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:32.880]   I think one of the things I've been thinking a lot about lately is scaffolding and the
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.420]   idea that when you're trying to improve at something, you don't need a permanent teacher
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.540]   necessarily.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:42.720]   You don't need one mentor guiding you for nine years.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.840]   What you need is somebody who can give you the temporary support that allows you to scale
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.460]   to a new height, just like a scaffold would on a building.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.800]   And in learning theory, basically the idea behind scaffolding is we're gonna initially
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.060]   give you the support you need to solve a problem.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:00.380]   And then we're gonna slowly remove the support so that you learn to do it on your own.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:03.120]   And I think that those kinds of scaffolds are often missing.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.020]   So we instill the growth mindset, like I've got this belief in my head, but I don't know
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.320]   what I need to do to put that belief into action.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.560]   And that's where I guess that to me is, we have to go beyond mindset.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:18.760]   We have to think about how do we put people in a context that allows them to put their
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.320]   beliefs into practice.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:26.000]   You were asking me, what else do we need to support growth mindset and make it effective,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   right?
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.380]   - Yeah, I mean, we know when people learn what growth mindset is, it's the idea that
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:31.440]   you're not as good at something yet.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.540]   Okay, terrific, but it's very hard to implement in real time.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:39.880]   There are, I have to presume, additional tools that one can bolster the growth mindset with,
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.080]   make it more accessible and benefit from it.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080]   - Yes.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.480]   So Justin Berg and Amy Rezneski and I studied this actually.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.680]   We were looking at growth mindset at work.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.160]   And Justin's, well, he's at Stanford, I don't know if you've met him yet.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.240]   - I have not, but big place.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.580]   - He'll be on the list soon.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:07.060]   - Brilliant creativity researcher and Amy just joined us at Wharton and has fundamentally
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:12.640]   changed the way that I think about ideas in the way that she studied how we can shape
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.180]   our context and just done pathbreaking work there.
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:20.740]   And we were interested in growth mindset and we designed an intervention where people could
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.180]   learn growth mindset at work.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:27.000]   So we taught them to think about how their skills were malleable, how they could stretch
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.240]   their knowledge into new areas.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:33.700]   And we found that teaching them that was not enough to boost their happiness or their performance.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:38.820]   What we needed to also do was give them a growth mindset, not just about themselves,
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.300]   but also about their jobs.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:45.820]   In other words, to teach them that your job is a set of flexible building blocks, that
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:48.220]   you've got a whole bunch of tasks that make up your job.
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:53.860]   Some of those are things to do, others might be interactions that you need to have.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:57.560]   And if you break down your job into all these tasks, you might have some tasks that you
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.160]   want to accentuate and make a bigger part of your job.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.820]   Others that you want to try to subtract, others that you might swap with a colleague.
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.760]   And a lot of people, it turns out, think their jobs are fixed by their job descriptions.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:13.200]   But in fact, you have a ton of opportunity to say, "Wait a minute, there's a strength
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.500]   I have, but I'm not using it right now.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.580]   Is there a way we can bring that into my work?"
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:21.140]   And so in these couple of experiments we did, when we randomly assigned people to learn
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.820]   both that their jobs were malleable and that their skills were malleable, they got a sustainable
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.740]   boost to their happiness that lasted at least six months.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:33.420]   There was no cost to their performance, meaning you could redesign your own job to be more
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:40.580]   enjoyable without a drop in the effectiveness of your contributions to your workplace.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:44.980]   And I think what I came away from that research realizing is, it's not enough to just say,
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.860]   "Well, I can get better, I can improve."
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:52.500]   Because very often you feel like your environment is limited, like, "Great, I can grow, but
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.140]   I'm stuck in a dead-end job."
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:59.340]   And so what we need to do there is open up the opportunity for people to innovate on
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:04.060]   their own job description, and then the growth mindset can begin to have an impact.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:10.820]   - I love it, it sounds a bit like adding a S to growth mindset.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:14.080]   So it's not growth mindset, it's growth mindsets.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.580]   Because earlier you mentioned that in the classroom environment, if the teacher adopts
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:22.140]   a growth mindset, as well as the students, well then you have a culture of growth mindset.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:27.380]   So it's the interconnectedness of this and the context in which the individual's growth
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.380]   mindset exists.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.380]   Do I have that right?
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:30.380]   - Well put.
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.380]   Yeah, we ended up calling it dual mindset.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:39.020]   But I think making it a plural is good, because it's not, I have this image of, you put a
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:43.900]   person in a cage and then tell them they're capable of growing, they're still stuck in
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.900]   a cage.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:49.500]   And so we need to give them a chance to bust through those walls.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500]   - Super important.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:55.760]   I hate to take us back to an earlier topic, but there's something that I meant to ask
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.100]   you that I didn't, and I'm absolutely needing to ask you.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:05.260]   Which is your recent work, or recent-ish work, it was a few years back now, and you're so
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:10.740]   prolific that I have to call it a few years back.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:16.800]   The relationship between intrinsic motivation and performance on other tasks.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.420]   And the reason I asked this is several fold.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:24.420]   I did two episodes of the podcast on ADHD.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:30.180]   And one of the things that I learned in talking to experts on ADHD, people with ADHD, as well
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:35.500]   as looking at some of the novel treatments, everything from behavioral to prescription
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:43.340]   to even nutrition-based, was that kids and adults with clinically diagnosed ADHD are
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:48.460]   actually terrific at paying attention to things that they really enjoy, or that they're super
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:49.460]   interested in.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:56.060]   So clearly they have the capacity, it's just that they have deficits, if you will, in attending
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:01.260]   to things that are less exciting to them, less intriguing to them.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:07.180]   - So if I recall correctly, you have a publication that explored the relationship between intrinsic
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:13.100]   motivation and performance in other stuff, and one of the major conclusions was that
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:19.580]   having a deep, deep interest in one thing might not be the best condition for performing
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.780]   well at other less interesting tasks.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:27.820]   Could you tell us about that study, what motivated you to carry out that study, and what some
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.020]   of the major takeaways were?
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.400]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.040]   You summarized it really well.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.820]   I think the original impetus, so this was another project with Ji-He Shin, and Ji-He
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.060]   came to me wanting to study intrinsic motivation.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:43.200]   And we were talking about what do we know about intrinsic motivation, and what are the
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.740]   gaps in our knowledge?
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.180]   And one thing that has always bothered me is when psychologists study something that
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.740]   sounds positive, and they only study the benefits of it.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.660]   I'm like, there's no such thing as an unmitigated good, right?
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:24:02.460]   All sort of enjoyable experiences have costs, all unpleasant experiences can have benefits.
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:09.120]   We need to fill out this two by two of good thing, bad thing, good outcome, bad outcome.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.760]   And so my challenge to her was, can you show me the dark side of intrinsic motivation?
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:20.140]   And she came back and she said, what if there's a cost of loving a task, leading you to hate
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.900]   a task that you don't like even more than you did before?
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:26.340]   It's like, oh, that's an interesting idea, it tracks with the basic psychology of contrast
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:33.220]   effects, where if you eat something delicious, then your least favorite food tastes a little
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.420]   bit worse afterward.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.940]   And so I said, let's study this.
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.480]   So she ended up getting data from people at work.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.380]   And then we also designed an experiment, and sure enough, the more passionate you are in
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:50.580]   task one, the more your performance suffers if task two is really boring.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:54.220]   And I guess what this did for me is it made me think differently about task sequencing.
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:58.740]   I used to wake up in the morning and do my most interesting task first.
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:01.900]   And then the grading was hell.
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:04.700]   And what I do now is I start with a moderately interesting task.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.060]   It's a little bit of a warm up for me.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.500]   And then I have an exciting one to look forward to.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.740]   And if I do have a task that's boring but important, I think the performance is going
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.700]   to suffer less.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.100]   Interesting.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:20.940]   I normally don't ask about morning routines and how one structures a day because it's
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.940]   highly individual.
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:22.940]   Completely agree.
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:30.200]   And it depends on whether or not people have kids and their pets and other, but I'll just
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.200]   share with you a brief anecdote.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.860]   I have a friend who's a very accomplished musician and has been for several decades
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.860]   now.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.520]   And he told me that he has a practice of after he gets off stage and he's like stadium, stadium
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:48.280]   sellout level musician has been for a long time and it shows no signs of stopping.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280]   Just incredible.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.100]   But a very down to earth person.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:55.860]   And he said, one of the first things he does when he gets off stage is to go do some menial
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:56.860]   task.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.540]   I thought there's no way that's true, but I've known his wife since college.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.880]   And she, she verified that statement.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.380]   I was like, what, what sorts of menial tasks you're talking about?
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:07.400]   He's like, oh, like cleaning up some of the cans and things that are there.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.780]   He's even cleaning a toilet at a venue.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:13.340]   And I thought, no chance, but it turns out to be true.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.460]   And I said, what, what's this about?
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:15.460]   Is this about humility?
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:19.660]   He said, well, maybe a little bit, but he said it actually makes it a lot easier for
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:27.220]   him to return home and deal with the kind of little things that just are out of scale
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.300]   with the experiences that he just had.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:30.300]   He's tapering.
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.300]   Oh, okay.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:32.300]   I think.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.440]   So first of all, I was so struck by the fact that he had created this process for himself
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.440]   so long ago.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.680]   And he's also somebody who's, you know, he's maintained and he's like been the same marriage
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.200]   for an extremely long time.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.520]   He's he's extremely happy in that and his family.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.180]   I mean, one of these people that seems to thrive in all domains of life, and I'm certain
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:55.600]   that he struggles in some domain of life because everybody does, but it sounds to me like a
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.320]   very unusual practice, but it seems to kind of relate to this, that, you know, he has
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.720]   this thing that he loves doing, playing music and performing in particular.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.960]   And he's just, you know, you know, 0.01 percent at doing that and just like bring himself
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.880]   back down to earth because so much of life and especially family life is like dealing
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.680]   with the schmutz and the inconvenience of everyday life.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.800]   It actually sounds like what he's doing is he's resetting his frame of reference to say,
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:28.080]   if you know, if I go right home, then the contrast between this high octane experience
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:34.520]   I'm having and sort of muddling through everyday life is going to be extreme.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.560]   If I do something really small, then family time is going to seem a lot bigger.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.080]   So I realize I'm taking a bit of a leap from your study on intrinsic motivation and low
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.360]   performance in other domains.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:53.560]   But you know, to me, cleaning up, cleaning a toilet is, you know, it's it's it's boring
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.040]   for all the wrong reasons.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   Right.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.360]   You do not want that to be an exciting task.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.360]   No.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.160]   And listen, I mean, if I had to do it for a living, I would.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.480]   And I would try and do as well as possible.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.200]   But right.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:12.560]   So well, I found that study to be particularly interesting because I think that these days
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:19.560]   we glorify high performance, even quote unquote peak performance, something we can talk about.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:24.760]   And we forget that, yes, oftentimes people who are ultra high performers can afford to
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.040]   pay other people to do all the other stuff.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.960]   But I have to say, in knowing some ultra high performers and in knowing some people in the
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:39.400]   billionaire bracket, you know, there's a high incidence of of mental health issues, frankly,
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:45.820]   and lack of satisfaction with life that maybe even comes from not having to do anything
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:50.100]   besides the things that you find most intrinsically rewarding.
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:54.000]   We all think that, oh, if I could, I would spend all day doing the things that I find
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.280]   most intrinsically rewarding.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.360]   But maybe there's something about this push pull.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.520]   We know the brain works in push pull with almost everything that having some experiences
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.440]   each day that are kind of like this thing again, do you think that heightens our level
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.640]   of satisfaction for the things we really enjoy?
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.760]   I would be surprised if it didn't.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.600]   I think I think contrast effects are very powerful.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:21.980]   And we know I mean, there's half a century of research on happiness suggesting that the
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:25.560]   comparisons we make are what matter.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.420]   You know, I think I think Tim Urban probably put it best when he said happiness is reality
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.260]   minus expectations.
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:40.320]   And if you only have enjoyable experiences, your expectations are rising into perpetuity.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.400]   So it doesn't matter how good your reality is.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.880]   You wanted it to be better and better.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:50.560]   I think one of the things that mundane experiences manage to do for us or maybe a better way
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.880]   to say it is I think one of the benefits of mundane experiences is they keep our expectations
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:00.520]   on the ground and allow us to be pleasantly surprised by a task that was more interesting
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.820]   than we expected, even though we didn't love it.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:10.180]   What are your thoughts on what I call momentum, which is when I have an experience I particularly
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:13.940]   like, like if we record a podcast and I'm really excited to get it out into the world,
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:18.200]   or if I have some experience that I'm left very excited by at the end, that oftentimes
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:23.680]   is the energy, again, I'm obsessed with this concept of neural energy, the energy that
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:28.920]   I glean from that experience seems to have carry over into other things.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.760]   You know, I'm going to be much more excited to just go across the street and get a cup
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:33.760]   of coffee.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:37.500]   Feels like a bigger thing than it normally would.
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:42.000]   And I would think that one could kind of ride the wake of a prior accomplishment, even a
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.600]   small accomplishment each day and make the, you know, tidying up or doing things that
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.360]   one would normally find more boring, less boring.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.520]   Is that true?
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.860]   The way you're describing contrast effects makes it seem like it's more of a cliff, like
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.080]   that thing was great and now this thing.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.080]   But I also can kind of ride high on something that happened two, three days ago, maybe even
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.240]   two, three months ago.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:09.280]   So feeling good equates to feeling good or feeling good accentuates the bad stuff.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:12.560]   This is the tension between contrast and spillover.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.480]   And you can see both under different conditions.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:20.680]   I think this is a brand new sort of, I don't think anybody has reconciled those two perspectives
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680]   yet.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.640]   But my hunch from having worked on the contrast part of it is we found that it was only extreme
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:29.360]   intrinsic motivation that had the performance cost on other tasks.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:36.440]   So if you're enjoying something, if you like it, that will give you a lift for other tasks.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:43.000]   It's where this is the best thing you've ever done and now other things suck by comparison.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.120]   That's where we start to see run into a problem.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.320]   I also wonder if there's a domain switching effect here.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.680]   I think you're alluding to this.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:56.760]   I read some research that just came out this year showing that one of the surprising benefits
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.960]   of morning workouts is you actually have more confidence in your job because you get that
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:06.300]   small win, like I accomplished something this morning and that gives you a sense of efficacy
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:10.480]   that you can carry over into the start of your workday.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.940]   Not to suggest that everyone should work out in the morning because I'm with you.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:18.440]   I think everybody should both work and work out at a time that works for them.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:24.280]   But I think there's something to be said for something went really well in one realm of
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:29.960]   my life and that boosts my belief and my capability to tackle challenges in a different realm.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.480]   What about in the opposite direction?
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.040]   You were a competitive diver.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.360]   I have to presume that there were days when you had lousy dives.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.440]   It must have been that one day.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.120]   It felt like every day.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:51.760]   Then you leave, you shower up, dry off, head into the rest of your day.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:57.520]   How do we segment away from the negative thought spirals of something went really poorly?
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:01.120]   Now you're off into the domain of life where you know how to do the things that you're
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.280]   required to do, but maybe there's some challenge and some learning involved.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:08.760]   How do we cut moats between negative experiences?
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:12.160]   I think the Ted Lasso strategy is ideal.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:17.280]   Become a goldfish, 10 second memory, and then you don't even recall the practice you had
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.520]   earlier today.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:23.640]   I think that I don't know anybody who can do that consistently.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:28.960]   And I think the more disappointing the experience is, the more you tend to dwell on it.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:37.040]   I think when you talk about segmenting negative experiences, I think probably the research
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:45.200]   that I've liked best on this, and I just want to make sure I capture this clearly.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:49.320]   Research on emotion regulation says there are two strategies that tend to be effective.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.600]   One is distraction, the other is reframing.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:58.440]   Distraction is find something else that will consume your attention that's unrelated to
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:04.560]   the thing that you just bombed at, and the hope is that that fades into the background.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.440]   Diving is a lot of what you were talking about a few minutes ago, which is, "Okay, let me
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.880]   focus not on the level of my performance, but the slope."
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:18.840]   My diving coach, Eric Best, has a really great set of questions that he asks, and I remember
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:22.080]   I had finished practice, I'm like, "This is a terrible day.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.920]   I just feel like I'm worthless as a diver, and now diving was a big part of my identity.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.600]   I'm going to let my team down, now I'm a bad teammate too.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:35.760]   My coach is wasting his time, and now he could have been training somebody much better.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.700]   Why am I doing this?"
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:42.280]   And Eric would ask, "Did you make yourself better today?"
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.520]   And even if it was a bad practice, there is something that improved, yes, okay.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:51.640]   And sometimes the answer feels like no, and then he would ask, "Did you make someone else
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.640]   better today?"
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:58.840]   I'm like, "Yeah, I gave a little tip to a teammate.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:05.200]   I made a joke that made everybody laugh, and he was like, "Great, then it wasn't a bad day."
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.920]   And I think this is an example of what good reframing looks like, to say, "Okay, the goal
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.360]   wasn't to be great, it was to be better.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:17.580]   The goal wasn't necessarily just to make myself better, it was also to make other people better."
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:21.640]   And I think those are the kinds of questions that seem to segment pretty well.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:27.040]   I love that feedback, because I think we all get stuck in those thought spirals.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.400]   And again, not to demonize smartphones, because they are wonderful tools, but I have to remember
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:39.720]   the time, I'm 48 years old, as of tomorrow, and I have to remember a time in which negative
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.280]   stuff was probably happening in the background, but I didn't hear about it, because no one
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280]   was texting it to me.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.280]   So I'd find out at the end of the day, when I still had time to do other things in the
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.900]   meantime.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.460]   That said, I would also get negative experiences early in the day, and then carry them throughout
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:56.920]   the entire day when nowadays you can get a positive text message that says, "Okay, it
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.440]   wasn't so bad," or something like that.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:08.240]   But I do think, as is probably becoming apparent about, these channels of communication are
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.040]   either boons or disruptions to our positive psychology.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.640]   It's clear that we're just being bombarded all the time.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:21.600]   So just as a practical question, what is your relationship to your phone?
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:27.060]   Do you set boundaries around your phone use, or the types of communications and activities
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:29.260]   that you engage with on your phone?
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:30.260]   I do.
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:33.300]   So I think everyone I know has a to-do list.
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.820]   I also have a to-don't list.
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:40.860]   And on my to-don't list includes, I don't scroll on social media, and I don't pick up
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:43.700]   my phone past 9 p.m.
[01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:47.440]   And those two habits are enormously helpful, particularly the not scrolling.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:52.680]   I pick up my phone when I have something to post or when I want to see what the comments
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:56.880]   are and then see if there's something interesting to learn or somebody that I want to respond
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.340]   to.
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:01.780]   And that becomes a really healthy boundary because I don't get stuck in one of these
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:08.620]   rabbit holes where all of a sudden two hours have gone by and I feel like I wasted my time.
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:12.360]   Where do you post or keep your to-do and your to-don't list?
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.920]   Do you keep them on your phone?
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.200]   No, it's a Word document on my computer.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.200]   Okay.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.480]   So you're still at the computer screen quite a bit each day?
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.480]   Okay.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.080]   I feel like that's where most of my good thinking and writing happens.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.920]   I carry a small notebook around with me now and write things down.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.920]   I was just curious.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.920]   Like one of these?
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920]   Well, like one of those.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:34.920]   I try not to take notes on my phone ever.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.920]   Right.
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:40.900]   It can be problematic for me, especially with voice recognition now because you just, it's
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.400]   hard to go back to that in a systematic way for me, but I'm a big believer in these things
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.980]   that for those listening and not watching, I'm holding up a pen, pencils work too.
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:53.280]   You've probably read some of the research also showing that you have a better memory
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.600]   for information when you take notes by hand than by keyboard.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.440]   I didn't know that, but I'm very, very gratified to hear that.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.840]   And I suppose if you don't have a pen and you don't have a pencil handy, then blood
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:06.840]   always works.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.840]   Just kidding.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.840]   I'm just kidding.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.120]   Don't make yourself or anyone else bleed just to get an idea down.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.240]   But it is amazing how sometimes we will have ideas while running, walking, showering out
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.680]   and about, and then later try and recall those ideas.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.180]   And if we don't write them down, they're gone.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.760]   The great Joe Strummer from The Clash talked about the critical importance of carrying
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.800]   around a small notebook such as you did, because he said that the ideas fall down like rain.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.520]   And if you catch them, they're there.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.440]   But if you miss them, they truly won't be there later.
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.840]   And that's, there's something kind of eerie about that.
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.440]   Like why wouldn't we be able to remember these potential gems of ideas?
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.840]   All right.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.000]   The geysering up of the mind.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.840]   We had a guest on this podcast for a series, Dr. Paul Conte, a psychiatrist, and he talked
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.720]   extensively about the unconscious mind.
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.000]   I mentioned this a little earlier, but one of the things that really stuck with me is
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.920]   he said, "Everyone thinks that the prefrontal cortex and the frontal cortex is the supercomputer
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.000]   of the human brain.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.120]   Sets context, planning, strategy switching, et cetera, et cetera, certainly it's valuable
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.380]   real estate to our intellect and all our abilities."
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:16.520]   But he said, "The real supercomputer is the unconscious mind.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.160]   However, that unconscious mind that lives below the surface of our awareness is also
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.440]   what drives a lot of our unconscious defenses."
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.800]   So our so-called blind spots, so projection, projective identification, I mean, these can
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.800]   be both good or bad.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:34.300]   They can serve us well or poorly and so on and so forth.
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:40.240]   But implied in this notion of the unconscious and blind spots is that we can't become aware
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:46.000]   of things unless we either do dedicated work to become aware of them, or even better would
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.520]   be dedicated work where we are asking other people to say, "Hey, listen, you have a blind
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.720]   spot and it is blank, blank, and blank.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:59.240]   So tell us about the role of blind spots, maybe even some positive aspects of having
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:06.180]   blind spots," but more importantly, what we can do to fill in those blind spots and perhaps
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.100]   also explain how they can limit us.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:13.420]   And if you have any examples from the research where people overcoming their blind spots
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:15.200]   has benefited them, that would be amazing.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.200]   Wow.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.200]   There's a lot there.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.580]   Well, let me start by saying, I think a lot of people think about blind spots in terms
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.440]   of heuristics and biases.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:29.560]   So you think about confirmation bias, you think about the classic Kahneman-Tversky work
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:36.100]   that ended up winning Danny a Nobel Prize on the way in which our intuitive judgments
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:41.840]   often get anchored in the way we've done things before, or we focus on the information that's
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.040]   salient and available to us and overlook less obvious information.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:52.160]   I've come to think that the mother of all biases is what I think of as the I'm not biased
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.160]   bias.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:58.320]   It's technically called the bias blind spot in Emily Prone and colleagues' research, but
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.640]   the idea is that I think I'm more objective than other people.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:08.320]   And you may have flaws in your thinking, Andrew, but me, I see things clearly and rationally.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.780]   And I think that it's a really dangerous meta bias because the moment you believe you're
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:17.640]   not biased, you are incapable of seeing any of your biases.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:24.460]   So in some of the research on the bias blind spot, you see that people who score high in
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:29.480]   cognitive ability tests, so high IQ, are actually more likely to fall victim to the I'm not
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:35.760]   biased bias because they've been reinforced for a lifetime that they're really smart and
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:36.760]   they're good at thinking.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:37.760]   - Oh, goodness.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.860]   This explains some, we don't talk about current events on this podcast much, but this explains
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:45.540]   some current events of people that were told their entire careers that they are perfect
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:52.220]   or near perfect and circumstances eventually came to slam them hard into the concrete on
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:53.960]   that one.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:42:01.440]   - Or in some cases it hasn't happened yet, but we watch them hurtling toward earth.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.940]   So I worry a lot about that.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:07.160]   So I think the beginning of seeing any blind spot is recognizing that we all have blind
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.560]   spots as part of being human.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:13.440]   I think that the brighter side of that is that we're not just blind to weaknesses, we're
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:16.120]   also blind to our strengths.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.620]   So Jane Dutton and Laura Morgan Roberts and colleagues did some research on the reflected
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:22.620]   best self portrait.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:26.960]   This is one of my favorite exercises to do in the classroom, but also to do in workplaces,
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.500]   sometimes even people end up doing it with their kids at home.
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:34.040]   The idea is that you do have strengths that you're not that aware of.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.640]   They may be things that come naturally to you that you don't even realize are hard for
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:37.640]   other people.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.120]   They may be things that are struggles for you.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.460]   And so you think it's hard to do and therefore I'm bad at it, but other people watch you
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:47.720]   do it and realize you're actually quite good at it.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.840]   So you need other people to hold up a mirror to see what these invisible strengths are.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:56.760]   So the way the reflected best self exercise works is you're asked to contact 10 to 20
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.840]   people who know you well in different walks of life.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:02.940]   Might be a family member, a couple of friends, some colleagues, and then you ask them to
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:06.520]   tell a story about a time when you were at your best.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:10.840]   And you collect these stories, it's the most exciting week of email you will ever get.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:14.200]   20 notes, let me tell you how great you are.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:18.000]   But what's key, this goes back to our discussion of feedback earlier, is they're really specific
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.840]   about a moment when you were at your best.
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:24.840]   And then your job is to collect all the stories and do the pattern recognition exercise and
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.880]   ask what are the common themes that I've seen through these stories?
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:33.760]   And it's a really powerful and vivid way of getting a sense of what are those strengths.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:38.520]   And it's not surprising that in some of the research when people go through this process,
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:42.700]   they end up with much more clarity, not only about what they're good at and where their
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:48.020]   potential lies, but also what do those situations have in common where I was able to use my
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:51.040]   strengths and how do I get myself in those situations more often?
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.160]   How do I create those situations more often?
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.240]   I'll give you a personal example on this.
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:03.120]   So I got a bunch of feedback that I was good at helping other people see their strengths.
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.600]   And I thought, okay, I don't feel like I have enough opportunities to use that strength
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:08.640]   in my daily life.
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:10.800]   So what am I going to do about this?
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.760]   And I ended up flipping the exercise upside down.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.220]   And I picked 100 people who really mattered to me.
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:21.400]   And I wrote a story to each of them about a time when they were at their best.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:27.640]   And there's no reason I can't make this part of my day.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:29.800]   It was probably one of the best weeks of my life.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.480]   It was better than getting the stories I was giving them.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:38.040]   And I got these notes back from people saying, I didn't realize, I don't even remember that
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.960]   thing that happened.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:48.160]   But I think for me, it was an example of saying, okay, I've always enjoyed trying to bring
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.840]   out the best in others.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.040]   I don't feel like, at the time I was a first year doctoral student, I didn't feel like
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.740]   I had anything to contribute to others.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:02.280]   I'm trying to learn how to understand this field and do a worthwhile study and write
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:03.280]   a paper.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   I'm not teaching yet.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.360]   I have no value to add.
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:09.600]   And getting this feedback like, oh, you're somebody who helps other people see their
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:10.600]   potential.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:15.340]   I'm like, all right, let me take some people that I already recognize really amazing things
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.400]   in and let me just tell them that.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:25.120]   And it took me about a week to write the 100 emails and I can't think of a week I've spent
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.120]   better.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120]   - Wow.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:34.620]   It's so interesting that you flipped the process on its head a bit or a lot and that ended
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:35.620]   up being the reward.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:39.740]   Do you think you learned anything about, given that it was early in your academic career,
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:46.720]   do you think you learned anything about your particular talent or desire to do what you
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:47.720]   do now?
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.180]   I mean, so much of what you described seems to map well to what you do now.
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:58.140]   I mean, you could be, if you were to choose or have chosen just, not just, but a laboratory
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.000]   scientist doing experiments.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.520]   You're clearly still doing that with tremendous productivity, but you've also decided to tell
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.460]   the world about the information that you're gathering and the work of a lot of other people
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.460]   as well.
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:14.380]   I guess I feel a kinship here because we both do this.
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:17.460]   - Much more interesting to cite other people's work than talk about what you already know.
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.860]   - It is indeed.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:24.040]   - And it's fun to be able to weave one's understanding of the process into what are other people
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:28.540]   doing and know how hard it is to do really good experiments and be able to spot really
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:29.700]   good experiments.
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:35.860]   But did you learn in that early stage of your career that like, I think I want to do this
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:40.660]   later because what you do now is it maps pretty well onto what you just described.
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:44.860]   - I don't think it was, it wasn't crystallized at the time, but it was definitely one of
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:52.460]   those seeds that was planted that must have grown because I remember right after I got
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:58.060]   tenure a wonderful colleague of mine asked if I would write a book with him and I was
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:02.780]   so flattered and I went in to talk to my undergrad research lab later that day and I mentioned
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:08.420]   offhand, I was like, hey, I got this invite, I'm gonna write this book and they freaked
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:09.420]   out.
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:11.220]   Like, no, you cannot write somebody else's book.
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:13.780]   You have to write about your ideas first.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:16.600]   If you're gonna write a book, write your own book.
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:22.340]   And I was very resistant because I love other people's ideas.
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:28.960]   I feel like what I do best, I think it was Boyer who wrote about the scholarship of discovery
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.180]   versus the scholarship of integration.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:38.420]   And I never felt like I was a Eureka, blindingly original insight person.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:45.700]   I felt like what I was good at was synthesizing ideas and kind of taking a bunch of pieces
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:49.340]   of cloth and sewing them into a quilt and allowing people to see the big picture in
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.340]   a way they hadn't before.
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:54.020]   And I felt like I could do that with a colleague who was already a successful author.
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:57.860]   And my students basically held me hostage and they said, you've been doing this research
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:04.340]   for over a decade now and you have a responsibility to share that outside your classroom.
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:10.300]   And it reminded me of that experience of saying, okay, there's something I see in other people.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:15.440]   I wanna share it with them and maybe I could do that on a broader scale.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.520]   So yeah, I think there were definitely dots that connected there.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.340]   - When I was a master's student at Berkeley, there was a guy who's now moved to Michigan
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:27.880]   State, Mark Breedlove, who I hope to host on the podcast actually does really interesting
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:30.940]   work on the biology of sexual differentiation.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:31.940]   And-
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:32.940]   - Mark, I think that's an invite if you're listening.
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.520]   - Yeah, right.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:37.200]   And he, it is indeed.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:43.080]   And he said to me, he said, you know, review articles provided they are written by people
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:50.840]   who are credentialed in a given field are cited at, you know, a hundred X, any one particular
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:51.840]   paper.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.060]   Now at the time I wasn't interested in impact factors.
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:59.100]   In fact, I've never paid any attention to impact factors.
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:05.400]   Their importance varies in different countries and in the U.S. they play some role more so
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:11.360]   in Europe, but I could care less about impact factor, frankly, because those metrics aren't
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.580]   what it's going to carry you through the difficulty of designing and carrying out a hard experiment.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:18.180]   You have to be intrinsically curious about the answer, right?
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:25.780]   You know this and I know this, but he basically said something that really supports your point,
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:31.180]   which is that ultimately the ability to synthesize information can feel really good.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:34.620]   And he started talking about the feeling that he got from doing that.
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:36.940]   He's also a tremendous bench scientist as well.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:41.120]   In any event, I'm so glad that you flipped that exercise on its head because now the
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.600]   world gets to benefit from you doing that for us all the time.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.220]   Because I realize now that much of what you do is to help people identify and erase their
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:54.020]   blind spots by, and I love your social media channels.
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:50:01.900]   And I noted on Instagram and I do scroll, but I scroll through and to your channel too,
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:08.340]   you'll put up in short form content that really highlights the key importance of people embarking
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:11.380]   on strategies that they wouldn't reflexively take.
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:12.880]   I see that over and over again.
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.880]   It's like, we think that the best leaders do blank, but actually the research says they
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.080]   do exactly the opposite and you have a vast kit of those.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:28.100]   So along those lines, what are some of the most common blind spots that you observe and
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:34.920]   that people could benefit from understanding and doing contrary action around as it relates
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.800]   to, let's say interpersonal relations in the workplace or at home.
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:45.220]   And maybe we could seed this with a finding that you've also written about, which is that
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:51.060]   people who have and exert a lot of proficiency and even control in their professional life
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:55.360]   will sometimes bring that to their relationship life and that doesn't work, right?
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:01.940]   The idea that being in charge and being confident is a great set of attributes, but it can really
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:03.840]   fail us in other domains.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.760]   Can we weave that in with blind spots?
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.220]   - Yeah, we can.
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:13.400]   So I think that, so one of the things I found over the past few years is that, and this
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.040]   was inspired by a Phil Tetlock framework.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:20.640]   A lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking like preachers, prosecutors, or politicians.
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:26.400]   - Yeah, so you can think about these as three mental modes that even if you've never worked
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:31.320]   in any of these careers, you will watch your thinking colored by at least one of them more
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.860]   often than you would like.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.900]   So in preacher mode, you're basically proselytizing your own views.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:43.560]   And I mean, Andrew, in some situations I think of you as a highly effective professional
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:53.180]   debunker of preachers of certain kinds of snake oil when it comes to health and biology.
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:57.200]   Sometimes you take that too far and people might accuse you of being a prosecutor where
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:00.000]   you're attacking other people's views.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.560]   And then the third mode, politician mode, is basically you don't even bother to listen
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:07.320]   to people unless they already agree with your views.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:12.720]   - What I think is interesting is these modes of thinking are adaptive in certain roles.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.340]   So preachers make great salespeople.
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:17.160]   They're often visionary leaders.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:19.400]   Prosecutors are often highly effective scientists, right?
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:24.280]   We excel at criticizing other people's work and finding what's wrong with it.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.040]   Politicians are great at currying favor.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:28.680]   They do a lot of lobbying, they win approval.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.940]   The problem is that all of these modes stop you from questioning your own assumptions
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.640]   and beliefs.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:37.940]   So I'll tell you my biggest vice is prosecutor mode.
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:39.740]   I've been called a logic bully.
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:43.800]   My wife had to explain to me that was not a compliment.
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:46.000]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.760]   - I mean, I know you've experienced this too, if I feel confident that there's strong evidence
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:56.220]   that somebody is wrong, I believe it's my moral responsibility to correct them.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.660]   And that never goes well.
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.500]   - Amazing.
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:05.100]   I won't reflect on my own experience, I'll just say yes and yes.
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:16.240]   - Right, right, the logic word ninja mode is one that I think we're trained in as academics.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:21.040]   Or if you're a lawyer or many other professions as well.
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:25.360]   And I think it holds value and it can be very effective in certain domains, but less effective
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360]   in other domains.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.360]   - Yes.
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:34.200]   And I think part of the problem is, actually, whether you're preaching, prosecuting or politicking,
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:36.540]   you look like you're not open.
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:40.400]   Because you've already, in all cases, you think you're right and other people are wrong.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:45.420]   And so that makes it really hard for other people to reason with you, to disagree thoughtfully
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:46.420]   with you.
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:51.340]   So my favorite alternative, and this is at the heart of what you do for a living and
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:55.120]   for fun, is thinking like a scientist.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:58.360]   And when I say thinking like a scientist, I do not mean that you need to buy a microscope
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.800]   or invest in a telescope.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:04.200]   What I mean is, as you model so effectively, a good scientist has the humility to know
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.520]   what they don't know and the curiosity to constantly seek out new knowledge.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.460]   There have been multiple experiments showing that when people are taught to think like
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:15.200]   scientists, their judgment improves and so do their decisions.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:20.380]   And I think a lot of that stems from when you go into scientist mode, you realize that
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:23.880]   all of your opinions are just hypotheses waiting to be tested.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:25.800]   All of your decisions are experiments.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.460]   And so, well, I'm not trying to prove that I'm right, I'm trying to find out if I might
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:31.460]   be wrong.
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:34.240]   And then if I find out I am wrong, it's easier to pivot.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:39.460]   And instead of being really invested in being right, I can try to get it right.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:43.920]   And I think in some ways that's the meta message that I'm trying to communicate to people with
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:47.500]   my work is assumptions are meant to be pressure tested.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.040]   They're meant to be questioned and challenged.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.960]   And if you're not open to rethinking your views, then you basically turn thinking into
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:55.860]   a religion.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:55:02.120]   And I don't know about you, but I prefer to base my views on good data as opposed to blind
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:03.120]   faith.
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:06.480]   And I think that's been a huge part of your contribution in the last three or so years
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:12.420]   to public discourse is you've helped people think more scientifically and talk more scientifically
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:14.080]   about their daily habits and behaviors.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:19.000]   And I guess my big question is how do we help people do that more often, even in domains
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.360]   where they don't have access to scientific knowledge and they don't read journals?
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.940]   - First of all, thanks for the kind of words of feedback.
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:31.080]   I think my goal is always to identify who's coming to the podcast for health tools and
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:34.520]   protocols and hopefully teach them some science and scientific thinking.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:37.440]   And for those that are coming to the podcast for science and scientific thinking, hopefully
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:39.760]   they get some health tools and protocols also.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.280]   But because I fell in love with science for the exact reason that you're describing, which
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:49.200]   is that I grew up in a family that was very divided politically along religious lines
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.800]   along essentially every line of like what foods to eat, what was healthy, what wasn't.
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:56:00.080]   And the only way I could reconcile these very frankly polarized views was to embark on the
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.680]   scientific method, pose a hypothesis, and then try and disprove one's hypothesis.
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.520]   And some things get through the filter and it's a constant learning.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:14.960]   So I should just ask when you teach people how to be a scientist in order to try and
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.460]   overcome some of their blind spots and be better thinkers, better meaning it serves
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:25.680]   themselves and the people around them better, is that teaching them what a hypothesis is,
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:32.060]   that a hypothesis is not a question, it's sort of you wager on an idea with the understanding
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:35.320]   that you very well could be wrong and then you try and disprove that idea.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:41.240]   That's sort of the crux of what in these experiments you're describing as teaching people how to
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:42.240]   be scientists.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.000]   Like if they just do that, then they'll, they're going to benefit.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.080]   I think that's, that's at the very heart of the lens is I want to just double click on
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:54.760]   the idea of disproving your hypothesis because most people live in a land of confirmation
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.020]   bias where they're, they're basically just looking for support for their preexisting
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.020]   beliefs.
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.020]   That's right.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.020]   They're click foraging.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.760]   We all do this, by the way, I'm not criticizing here.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:09.760]   We all will have an idea and then we will click forage online to support the idea that
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.960]   we disagree with them.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.880]   They disagree with us, ah, here's somebody I agree with and that agrees with me.
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:20.720]   I think, and do you think this has roots in our you know, in the neural circuit underpinnings
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:28.880]   of of just wanting to have affiliation, that affiliation feels good, having people that
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:32.320]   are like us knowing that we're kind of protected in that.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:33.920]   Yeah, I think that's a big part of it.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:39.160]   I think one of the reasons that we, we encase ourselves in echo chambers and hide and filter
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:44.880]   bubbles is there's a, there's a strong evolutionary pressure to avoid social exclusion.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.280]   And so, you know, it's not, it's not just the, you know, being drawn to affiliation.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:54.320]   It's also, um, I, I really want, I'm afraid of being excommunicated from my group and
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:58.760]   if I challenge the orthodoxy of the community that I belong to, I might be an outcast.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.560]   Um, and I don't think, I don't think every day people think through that logic, but I
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:07.400]   think there's a, there's a deep seated, um, visceral tendency to avoid that.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:13.160]   And, you know, I think the, when we think about teaching people to see their blind spots
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:17.440]   more clearly, um, a lot of that is, is recognizing it's hard to do that on your own.
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:20.600]   Um, because by definition, your blind spots are invisible to you.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:23.760]   And so this is why other people's input is so important.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:28.780]   And I think, you know, I'm, I know this makes a lot of people uncomfortable, but I think
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:33.520]   everybody on social media should follow people that they disagree with, but not just for
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.600]   the sake of it.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:38.880]   You want people who reach different conclusions from you, but where you respect the integrity
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:39.880]   of their thought process.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:42.680]   Those are the people who really stretch your thinking.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.160]   And I think that's what we were trained to do.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:48.120]   Um, it's what I was trained to do as a social science, a social scientist is to listen to
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:52.200]   the ideas that made me think hard, not just the ones that made me feel good and to surround
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:55.520]   myself with people who challenged my thought process, not just the ones who validated my
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:56.520]   conclusions.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:59.480]   And I think, you know, a lot of people hear that message and they're like, no, but I don't
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:02.440]   want to let that like that awful perspective into my world.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:08.160]   I'm like, no, you, you want to be more nuanced in saying who are the people where before
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:14.520]   I knew what their answer was, I would be impressed with the depth and the thoroughness of their
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:16.680]   reflection and their analysis.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:23.000]   I should be following those people and learning from them regardless of the, the hypotheses
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.320]   that they generate and the results that they share.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:31.680]   I'm so glad that you mentioned the importance of following people that you disagree with.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:36.400]   I think one thing that we have to highlight and I'm hoping will maybe even emerge from
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:40.500]   this conversation is that follows are not endorsements.
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:41.500]   And this is actually a real problem.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:45.240]   I mean, there are academics who have lost their jobs, not necessarily for following
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:50.480]   certain accounts, but for, um, commenting on certain common threads, maybe even alike
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:54.280]   is a, is a slightly different category because it's, as the name suggests, it's a like it's
[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:59.040]   a, it sounds like, and it's thought of as a vote of approval of what's there.
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:05.520]   But when one's options are just, um, you know, a heart, uh, a follow or no heart, no follow.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:08.440]   Um, you know, I was a big fan of the thumbs up, thumbs down.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:12.040]   I kind of like the thumbs up, thumbs down because at least you have the, you have an
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:18.200]   option to, to, um, to dissent, um, without getting into online, uh, comment battles and
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.200]   things of that sort.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:24.760]   But, um, listen, I've, I've had, um, uh, people ask me, why do you follow so and so?
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:28.540]   Because follows are also seen as a sign of support because you're adding, adding followers
[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:32.860]   and presumably, uh, in the algorithm raising prominence to a channel, but I'm right there
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:33.860]   with you.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:37.940]   I follow lots of accounts, um, of people who I fundamentally disagree with, but I'm trying
[02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:41.780]   to learn and I'm also trying to understand what, what their capture points are.
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:43.720]   Like, like why people find them so intriguing.
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:44.720]   Yes.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:47.600]   Um, anyway, I'm, I'm a learner, I'm a forager like you.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:53.400]   So I, I'm in the same boat and every once in a while I think like it, it's stunning
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:54.400]   to me.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:01:00.980]   I looked at your, your Instagram statistics, um, but somebody, um, a colleague of mine actually
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:05.740]   showed me as I didn't, I didn't realize you could look at the effect of each post on follows
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:06.740]   and unfollows.
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:07.740]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:13.020]   And you know, the, I think that my typical ratio might be two or three to one for a post.
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:17.480]   So, you know, gaining two or three to two or three followers to every one that I lose.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:21.840]   The idea that I could post anything that would cause someone to unfollow me, like if I said
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.020]   something interesting enough that you thought I was worth following, how could, how could
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:27.980]   one post change your mind about that?
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:33.460]   I think you're too focused on what I think and maybe not paying attention to how I think,
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.900]   um, was my, my first reaction to that.
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:43.420]   And then my second, my second thought was, well, maybe, maybe what's happening here is
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:48.240]   like people show up and they don't realize the foundation of evidence behind the total
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:49.860]   body of work.
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:54.900]   And so one post strikes them wrong and they think this person is not credible or they
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:02:00.800]   think that this person has, um, you know, lost sight of, you know, of what rigorous
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:02.080]   science is.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.760]   I wonder if you've, you've had that experience too of like, I think I make the mistake of
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:12.680]   taking for granted that anybody who followed me knows that if I post something, I think
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:17.040]   it's worth thinking about and, um, you know, it's, it's been carefully studied and I didn't
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.140]   have a, you know, I didn't have a dog in the fight.
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:23.580]   I read this research and said this cleared the bar not only of an academic journal, um,
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:27.200]   but I read the methods and I found them sound enough that we ought to be discussing this
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.200]   idea.
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.000]   Um, have you had that experience too?
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.780]   Um, I certainly have.
[02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:36.060]   And I should say that, you know, I was weaned in an academic culture, three separate mentors,
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:44.400]   very different styles, all of whom, um, were excellent mentors, but all of whom taught
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:50.340]   me that, you know, there are phenomenal papers where every bit of information in the paper
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:55.540]   and indeed how it's written from start to finish is just watertight and incredible.
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:03:01.380]   And there are other papers that are less watertight, but occasionally there will be papers where
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:07.860]   one data point in a figure is intriguing enough to consider following that scent trail in
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:09.440]   your own work.
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:14.220]   Even if the rest of the paper is kind of eh, I mean one data point.
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:18.620]   Now that doesn't mean taking one data point and casting it out to millions of people on
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:21.660]   social media as an actionable item is, is, is valid.
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:22.720]   That's certainly not what I'm saying.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:28.700]   But what I do realize, and I'm realizing again now after what you just said, is that indeed
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:32.760]   people don't know the context near which, like what, like what filters are we working
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:35.060]   with before we bring things forward?
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:39.820]   And I think that, um, you know, my belief is that if it's grounded firmly in the scientific
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:44.800]   method that, um, that's the best starting place, we were talking about that earlier.
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:48.780]   And I also understand that scientists differ tremendously in how they look at even the
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:50.280]   same data and the same paper.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:55.140]   So there is no governing body that says, okay, this paper means blank.
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:57.400]   The authors have their interpretation.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.820]   The students have their interpretation.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.420]   In fact, the course I used to teach, um, to undergraduates, which grew into a very large
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:04.820]   course, we learned to ask four questions.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:07.500]   What's the question that the authors were asking?
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:10.220]   There's a sub question, what methods did they use?
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:11.440]   What did they find?
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:12.700]   And then what did they conclude?
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:14.700]   And does it relate back to the original question?
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:18.820]   And that simple, um, breaking out of four questions of studies, essentially what I do
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:19.940]   for all studies.
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:23.780]   Um, but I have my way of doing it and it's going to differ from the way that other people
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:24.780]   do it.
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:29.060]   Um, social media, uh, I think what's interesting is that I think there's always going to be
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:33.300]   a core following of a, of a given person, like your, your followers that they're going
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:37.300]   to trust, you know, not necessarily cross the board, but there's a general acceptance of
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:38.300]   ideas coming through.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:42.380]   I think that on social media, it's hard to strike a balance between setting the whole
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:45.620]   context and the actual takeaways.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:49.940]   I get criticized a lot for not being concise enough and I agree, but, but I also get criticized
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:52.060]   for putting things, taking things out of context.
[02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:56.460]   So, uh, it's a tight rope walk and it's always going to be a tight rope walk.
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:59.860]   And so I'm going to just, you know, keep going and I know you will too.
[02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:04.820]   Um, and, and listen, I, I'm, there's, there's some kids out there.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.600]   It's surely not going to be one that are going to take our jobs eventually and, um, and we'll
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:10.740]   find a way to do it much better.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:11.740]   Who knows?
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:12.740]   Through AI or something like that.
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:13.740]   It might be robots.
[02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:17.860]   Um, I feel like this is an appropriate place to ask about something else since we're talking
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:22.300]   about sort of perception of, uh, of others and, and gleaning information, overcoming
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.300]   blind spots.
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:26.600]   It's something that you've written about some years ago now, I guess it would be almost
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:30.240]   eight years ago now, um, about authenticity.
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:34.920]   Um, you know, the word authenticity is, is such a minefield, such a minefield.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:38.920]   I was going to say such a, has such a gravitate, positive gravitational pull, like, Oh, they're
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:43.320]   really authentic as opposed to what's the opposite of authentic fake, right?
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:49.840]   But um, I think we could all learn to draw some lines between authenticity and oversharing,
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:50.840]   right?
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:55.040]   Well, how do we gauge authenticity and we can refer people to that article you wrote
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.040]   some years ago.
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:06:00.720]   Um, you may have written it differently where to be written today, but you talked in that
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:05.900]   article about somebody who essentially decided to tell everyone that he worked with all the
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:10.940]   things that he was interested in, um, uh, doing with them, relating to them and it did
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:11.940]   not serve him well.
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:12.940]   Okay.
[02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:13.940]   So that's authentic.
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:14.940]   Right.
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:19.280]   And so then there's this, um, this notion of benevolent deception in order to preserve
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:24.560]   relationship and importantly, um, it brought about a word that we don't hear about very
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:27.720]   often, but that I rather like, which is etiquette.
[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:31.200]   Like there's, so for social media, by the way, I apply classroom rules.
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:34.760]   I'll tolerate any comment in the comment section, but not the sort of comment that I wouldn't
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:35.760]   tolerate in a classroom.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:40.960]   If you started insulting other, you can insult me, but if you want to insult other people,
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:42.700]   I'm not going to tolerate that.
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:46.000]   So, um, that's where I draw the line classroom rules.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.240]   There's an etiquette and I think that, um, etiquette is important.
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:59.280]   So how do we balance authenticity with etiquette and also with preserving one's, uh, uh, one's
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:02.780]   public life or private or private life, right?
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:04.440]   Authenticity at home seems important.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:10.520]   You could be your complete self at home except when you want to, you know, physically hit
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:16.040]   your sister or brother because they, your ice cream, that's not the right kind of authenticity.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.620]   No, no, it isn't.
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:22.580]   I think, well, I think it's such a rich and complicated topic.
[02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:30.060]   I think first thing is I, I don't want people to be disingenuous ever, but I have a real
[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:35.640]   problem with people saying as an excuse for disrespectful behavior, well, I was just being
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:36.640]   myself.
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:42.620]   Um, I think David Sedaris said, yes, but yourself is an asshole.
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.680]   So good.
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:44.680]   So good.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:47.780]   I think, I think what people forget is that we have, we all have multiple selves, right?
[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:51.100]   You, you, I mean, you've, you've, you've known this your whole career.
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:53.580]   Um, we all have multiple identities.
[02:07:53.580 --> 02:08:00.280]   We also could think about yourself as your thoughts, your emotions, um, your values,
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:01.280]   your personality.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:04.280]   So which facet of yourself are you trying to be true to?
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:11.260]   Um, I would argue that authenticity without boundaries is careless.
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.060]   Authenticity without empathy is selfish.
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:18.240]   And part of being authentic is caring about other people's values.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:20.260]   That should be one of your values.
[02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:23.560]   So what that means concretely is I don't think we should worry about being authentic to what
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:25.920]   we're thinking and feeling in any given moment.
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:31.400]   I think what we want to ask is what I'm about to do or say consistent with my principles.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.160]   And sometimes that means you will be false to your personality in order to be true to
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.640]   your values.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:41.120]   Sometimes that means you will, you will feel like you're not honoring your thought or your
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.620]   emotion in the moment, but you're doing that with a broader view toward who is the person
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:46.620]   that I want to be.
[02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:51.960]   There was a cultural critic, Lionel Trilling, who wrote about the idea of sincerity as opposed
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:53.480]   to authenticity.
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:54.780]   And I really liked this distinction.
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:58.040]   He said, when, when you, when you try to think about being authentic, you're trying to bring
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:08:59.820]   the inside out.
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:03.200]   And to your point, Andrew, that's not always appropriate or effective.
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:07.100]   He said, sincerity is a little bit more about bringing the outside in.
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:12.660]   So pay attention to the person you claim to be and then try to become that person.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:14.400]   And that was a little bit of an aha moment for me.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:19.260]   I realized, you know, there are all these people who say, well, you should, you know,
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:23.000]   you should, you should walk your talk.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.240]   And I think that's good advice.
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:28.680]   I might even go a step further and say, you know, maybe you should only talk it if you're
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:30.640]   already walking it.
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:33.580]   Maybe, maybe that would help us avoid hypocrisy.
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:39.700]   But I think the fundamental message here is that we all, we all could be authentic to
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:43.040]   one part of ourselves and inauthentic to another part.
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:47.480]   And I think the most important part is to ask, what do I stand for?
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:52.160]   And if I'm, what I'm about to communicate is not consistent with that, then maybe, maybe
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:55.520]   I could self-censor.
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:56.680]   Such great advice.
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:03.100]   And I suppose one has to wonder about the role of emotional states.
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:09.580]   You know, I think there are career ending mistakes that people make in a moment, especially
[02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:10.580]   online nowadays.
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:15.180]   And by the way, this is not just for people who are already established in their career.
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:20.200]   I've heard stories and there seem to be more and more of these in the news of, for instance,
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:23.980]   you know, videos of things that people said some years earlier, getting them ejected from
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:26.300]   college.
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:30.360]   A guest on Lex Friedman's podcast who works in the securities world said that one of the
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:35.000]   lessons that he teaches his kids is to not film themselves doing bad things, but in,
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.360]   and of course also not to do bad things, but in general to just not film themselves doing
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:43.720]   anything because of his understanding of the risk of doing that.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:49.620]   And we don't want to create a paranoia, but gosh, I mean, who you are when you're 14 is
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:55.300]   a very different person than who you are when you're 27 and when you're 50, so I hope so.
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:11:02.840]   So, you know, and so, yeah, I think, you know, balancing authenticity across the lifespan
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:06.820]   and we're expecting young minds to do this and clearly older minds can't do it either.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:11.940]   I mean, this is a pretty well known case of a chair of a major psych, the major psychiatry
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:12.940]   department.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:18.740]   We won't name the university, but basically lost his job for a single tweet.
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:20.240]   He just was not being thoughtful.
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:28.900]   In fact, he was being really like numb to, to other people and lost his job.
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:33.560]   And I think he, I don't know him and it was obvious why he lost it.
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:38.080]   I don't think it was debatable, but gosh, you think about somebody who's a chair of
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.440]   psychiatry, which means they're a psychiatrist, which means they're trying to think about
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:42.440]   thinking.
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:45.320]   And there you go.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.520]   It's amazing how common this is.
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:53.020]   And I think one of the things that's fascinating to me is, I guess this goes back to something
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:59.220]   we were talking about a moment ago, but I think that when we communicate, we have access
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:04.420]   to the sum total of all of our thoughts and everything we've ever, ever said that we can
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:05.420]   remember.
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:08.260]   And we forget that other people only have a snapshot.
[02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:12.680]   And so one of the questions I like to ask is if this was the only post that somebody
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:15.620]   saw of mine, would I be proud of it?
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:18.680]   Would it communicate who I am and who I aspire to be?
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:19.680]   So good.
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:24.000]   If the answer is no, maybe I should pause before I put that out there, that that is
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.720]   excellent advice.
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:30.720]   If it were the only post like your one and only representing you, Oh, fantastic.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:33.040]   Now that could be paralyzing.
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:35.480]   If you're a perfectionist, you'll never post.
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:41.520]   But I think for somebody who's posting regularly it's a good filter to just ask am I, you know,
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.960]   am I being thoughtful enough?
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:44.960]   So good.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:46.100]   I won't add anything to that.
[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:49.380]   Just say, I'll just say so, so good.
[02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:51.340]   Let's talk about potential.
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:55.460]   I was in junior high school and I remember having a social studies teacher who she just
[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:57.420]   would go on and on about potential.
[02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:59.340]   She has a special program after school.
[02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:02.740]   You could get involved potential, potential, potential.
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:06.980]   And we hear about this and, you know, we have untapped potential.
[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:09.960]   You hear we're only operating at 40% of our abilities.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:14.940]   You know, people will say that the implication is that we have reservoirs of potential.
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:18.700]   That we're just not accessing because we're not doing the right things, thinking the right
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:19.700]   things.
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:22.360]   I know you've now researched this topic extensively.
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.620]   You have a new book on this topic.
[02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:27.900]   Tell us about potential.
[02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:31.900]   Like do we all have huge reservoirs of potential that we are not accessing?
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:35.420]   And of course I and everyone else wants to know how can we access those?
[02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:41.980]   But maybe you could also tell us some of the myths around potential and tell us about potential.
[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:45.580]   Such a sticky topic for all the right reasons.
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:46.580]   Thank you.
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:50.880]   I, you know, it's one of those things where you've had this experience I'm sure many times
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:56.660]   where you start thinking and talking about a topic and you realize it's been your whole
[02:13:56.660 --> 02:13:59.260]   life but you didn't see it until then.
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:01.100]   And I feel that way about potential.
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:05.060]   I think that I've been passionate about helping people achieve their potential as long as
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:06.060]   I can remember.
[02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:10.500]   I think every goal I've ever set has been about stretching my potential in one way or
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:13.140]   another or at least realizing it.
[02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:18.260]   And what I've become so struck by as I've studied this topic is we all have hidden potential
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:20.220]   but we don't know how to unlock it.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:24.300]   So why do we often underestimate our own potential?
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:27.340]   We judge ourselves by our starting abilities.
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:31.820]   And this is more common for people with fixed mindsets but even people with growth mindsets,
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:35.580]   you try a new skill, it doesn't go well and you think this is not for me.
[02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:37.860]   I'm not cut out for this.
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:42.940]   And then it gets worse when other people also, you know, you're not just underestimating
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:43.940]   yourself.
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:45.340]   You're also being underestimated by others.
[02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:49.900]   Other people watch you and say, yeah, you don't have the, you know, you're not a prodigy.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:50.960]   You're not a natural.
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:52.780]   You don't have the talent that it takes.
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:57.760]   And I think the big myth there is that raw talent is the most important driver of how
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:59.420]   high people climb.
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:00.420]   It's not.
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:05.500]   Motivation and opportunity matter more than raw ability for growth.
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:08.060]   Motivation and opportunity.
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:09.060]   Yeah.
[02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:11.820]   Obviously, everybody starts at a different point.
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:18.900]   But how close you come to your potential is much more about the character skills you cultivate
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:21.020]   to improve and improving over time.
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:25.660]   And then whether you're in a situation where you have access to the knowledge that you
[02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:27.540]   need and the tools you need to keep growing.
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:33.660]   And so a concrete example of this for me is when I started diving, I was way too late.
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:36.080]   I picked it up as a teenager.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:40.260]   A lot of the elite divers in the world start by five.
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:41.260]   Goodness.
[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:46.980]   And actually, in China, they're handpicked for body type and sent to a version of diving
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:49.500]   boarding school where they don't even teach kids how to swim.
[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:53.540]   They tie a rope around them so that they can just pull them back after they hit the water
[02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:54.540]   in the deep end.
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:56.460]   What part of their body they tie a rope around?
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:58.100]   I think it's their waist.
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:03.000]   So they're diving with a rope so that when they get in the water, they're not wasting
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000]   any energy.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000]   Exactly.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.740]   They're just being dragged through the water and out.
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:09.380]   That's my understanding of it.
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:10.380]   Wow.
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:12.260]   But Brazil, they have to walk, they have to climb.
[02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:13.260]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:14.260]   Okay.
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:15.260]   So there are a bunch of other things they have to do.
[02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:16.260]   Yeah.
[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:17.900]   But the swimming apparently is very secondary.
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:24.240]   Anyway, so I started really late and I lacked most of the things that you would want as
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.180]   a diver.
[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:29.440]   I couldn't touch my toes without bending my knees.
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:32.960]   My teammates called me Frankenstein because I was so stiff when I walked.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:35.240]   So lacking the flexibility, I have no rhythm.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:39.560]   My coach brought a metronome to practice one day and I couldn't even keep the beat.
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:43.320]   So you think about diving as a sport of grace, nope.
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:47.740]   And then I also couldn't jump and I couldn't twist either.
[02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:49.480]   And it's like you're missing the explosive power.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:53.200]   You don't have the athleticism.
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:58.140]   And I think if I had just looked at those abilities, I had no business being a diver.
[02:16:58.140 --> 02:16:59.580]   And in fact, no business being an athlete.
[02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:02.100]   I'd already been cut from the middle school basketball team three times.
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:03.820]   I didn't make the high school soccer team.
[02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:07.020]   Those were the two sports I had poured a decade into.
[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:08.960]   This is going nowhere.
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.600]   Eric, just the most incredible coach I could ever imagine.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:22.440]   He said to me on the first day of practice, he said, "Yes, you're missing all these things.
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:28.160]   But I believe if you pour yourself into this sport that you could be a state finalist by
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:30.620]   the time you finish high school."
[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:35.960]   And he saw more potential in me than I saw in myself and that just lit a fire under me.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:42.120]   And what that translated into is a lot of the behaviors that you and I both studied,
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:47.240]   setting specific, difficult goals for I want to learn these dives that seem out of reach,
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:53.400]   for I want to increase my score over the next three meets by 10 points, for I want to learn
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:57.680]   how to-- all my limitations notwithstanding, one thing that I can master that I have total
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.080]   control over is how clean I go into the water.
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:04.380]   I can get a rip entry so that there's no splash, and that's the most important part of a dive.
[02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:07.820]   And one of the greatest compliments I ever got as a diver was I came out of a meet in--
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:12.740]   it was a couple of years in, I think I was maybe a junior in high school, and one of
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:16.600]   the judges turned to Eric and said, "All he can do is rip."
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:17.600]   And Eric said, "So?"
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:18.600]   I was like, "Yes!"
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:19.600]   It's awesome.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.680]   It's almost like saying, "All he can do is win," you know?
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:27.440]   Yeah, it was a great backhanded compliment, but Eric was like, "Listen, he made the dive.
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:28.760]   It has a degree of difficulty.
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:30.400]   Maybe he didn't jump as high as he wanted.
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:33.100]   Maybe his tuck wasn't as tight as he wanted.
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:36.920]   But at the end of the day, that dive disappeared straight up and down into the water.
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:39.080]   You can't not give that a seven."
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:42.880]   And that ended up serving me really well, and so I think the broader lesson here for
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:48.560]   me was Eric said to me-- actually, last year I never thought about this.
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:53.840]   He said-- I never got close to even qualifying for Olympic trials.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:59.120]   I did not have the talent to be that good, but I got way better than I ever expected.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:04.000]   Eric said to me, he said-- looking back, he said, "You got further with less talent than
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.920]   any diver I've ever coached."
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:09.660]   And that was so meaningful to me, and what it reminded me was my proudest accomplishments
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:13.120]   were not in the areas where I started out with the most talent.
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:18.080]   They were in the areas where I had overcome the most obstacles, and I think that, to me,
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:24.840]   is really what drives people around potential, is to say it's not performance that's motivating.
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:27.240]   It's a sense of progress.
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:30.320]   - I love that story, and I couldn't agree more.
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:36.080]   I mean, I think, Lord knows, my favorite topic in science is the course I performed, at least
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:41.520]   after my freshman year, which was abysmal, least well in the phase when I was doing well
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:42.520]   in--
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:43.520]   - What class was it?
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:44.520]   - Neural development.
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:45.520]   I now teach neural development.
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:46.520]   - I'm sorry, what?
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:47.520]   - Neural development.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:48.520]   - You said it at first.
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:51.000]   - Okay, well, I have to put it in context.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.040]   My high school and freshman year of college were abysmal, right?
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:57.040]   Basically no place being there.
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:01.240]   I can only thank my high school girlfriend for being so wonderful that I followed her
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:04.040]   off to college and ended up there.
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:07.240]   Left after my freshman year, came back, and then at that point, it was like a step function.
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:12.360]   I worked out of fear and excitement and love of the material.
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:17.040]   I was a straight-A student thereafter, but in my senior year, excuse me, I took a course
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:21.820]   in neural development, which was extremely challenging, and I got a B plus, and that
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:26.000]   B plus still gets me, but it's a topic that I love the most.
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.000]   It's what I did my graduate thesis on, it's what I teach at Stanford, among other topics,
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.320]   and I like to think now I have, I guess, humility side, considerable mastery over the material,
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.720]   but it's because I didn't do as well as I would have liked, and I applied myself so
[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:43.200]   much, and I think that it just didn't come naturally to me, and then eventually over
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:49.160]   time you kind of get it, or you get it.
[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:52.500]   But it's still my favorite topic because it was that friction point, right?
[02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:56.960]   It's the ratcheting through, and there's something, I don't know, that's just so intrinsically
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:58.000]   satisfying to me.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.160]   I used to watch my bulldog, Mastiff Costello, chewing on a bone, or when he was a little
[02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:07.680]   on a brick, because he had a Homer Simpson brain about his object choice to chew on,
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:09.720]   and he just looked like he was in just total bliss.
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:15.280]   It was like this effort combined with some intrinsic pleasure of the process.
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:19.620]   And so I think that when one is ratcheting through something that's hard, it feels so
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:23.340]   good that it's almost better than the outcome.
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:24.600]   It is better than the outcome.
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:30.760]   I think it is, and it's fascinating because this is why I'm always bothered by people
[02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:34.740]   saying play to your strengths, because if you do that, you will gravitate toward the
[02:21:34.740 --> 02:21:39.240]   things that come naturally to you, and you're going to miss out on, very often, the skill
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.600]   that was hard for you to learn.
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:44.780]   To your point, is one that you end up with greater mastery over, because you had to put
[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:50.560]   in the extra effort, and you end up deriving more satisfaction out of the fact that this
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:54.480]   was really tough, and I figured it out.
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:59.920]   Implicit in your story, and maybe partially explicit in some parts, when I was looking
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:04.840]   at the character skills that helped people realize their potential and really fuel unexpected
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:13.400]   growth, I ended up finding three that I think are under discussed and well supported by
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:14.400]   science.
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:18.720]   I think that basically if you want to reach your potential or achieve more than you think
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:23.520]   you're capable of, we're looking at becoming a creature of discomfort and embracing things
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:25.360]   that are unpleasant or awkward for you.
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:26.920]   That'll be the first thing.
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:33.500]   The second is being a sponge and soaking up new information and also filtering out what
[02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:35.220]   might not be useful.
[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:40.420]   And then the third is being an imperfectionist, which is knowing when to aim for excellence
[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:43.120]   and when to settle for good.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:46.380]   And I hear all of those themes in your story.
[02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:48.660]   That was obviously uncomfortable.
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:49.660]   You got to be plus.
[02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:53.460]   You don't want to do any more neural development, not at all.
[02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:56.600]   - It was so frustrating and so exciting to me at the same time.
[02:22:56.600 --> 02:23:00.680]   And then I went, everything I did in the five or seven years that followed was all about
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:04.900]   learning more about this topic because it wasn't about performing well or proving myself.
[02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:09.740]   I just, I love the material so much more because of how challenging it was.
[02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:14.320]   And I'm grateful to you, Ben Reese, the professor at UC Santa Barbara, incredible neuroanatomist
[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:18.080]   and teacher of neural development and laboratory scientists.
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:23.960]   Because I think had I gotten an A, I don't know that I would have fallen in love with
[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:24.960]   it in the same way.
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:25.960]   Isn't that weird?
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:30.700]   You wouldn't have had to work at it to discover what was fun about it, I imagine.
[02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:32.020]   - No, absolutely.
[02:23:32.020 --> 02:23:35.980]   And it's still one of my favorite topics to teach and learn about.
[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:42.140]   So you mentioned discomfort, being a sponge slash filter, if I got that right, and an
[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:45.140]   imperfectionist.
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:49.860]   Tell me more about the imperfectionist piece, because I feel like I've had students in my
[02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:54.180]   lab and I've known people in other domains of life that they're absolutely paranoid about
[02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:56.360]   shipping something out for the world to see it.
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:24:00.600]   And of course, no one wants to put stuff out into the world that isn't right and God forbid
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:05.740]   could be wrong, or that's going to embarrass us.
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:12.200]   So you can understand why people are perfectionists, but I never really understood the extreme
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:13.200]   perfectionist.
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.040]   How do they ever do anything?
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:16.640]   And are they happy people?
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:18.880]   Because I can't imagine that they are.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.760]   - No, I mean, this is, so Thomas Curran, I think is the world's leading psychologist
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:23.760]   studying perfectionism.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:29.040]   And if you look at his meta-analyses, perfectionism is a recipe for burnout and depression and
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:34.760]   anxiety because you're constantly comparing yourself to an ideal that's unachievable.
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:38.860]   Perfectionists are not, they do get better grades in school slightly, but they don't
[02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:45.000]   do any better at work than their peers because I think in school you have a predictable outcome.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.020]   You have a general sense of what's going to be on a test.
[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:51.720]   And if you study hard enough, you can come closer to the A plus, whereas at work performance
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:53.120]   is much more nebulous.
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:57.780]   And so what happens to perfectionists a lot of times is they end up optimizing the things
[02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:03.000]   that are predictable and controllable, and then sort of missing the forest and the trees.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:09.080]   And I think the antidotes, as far as I know, really have to do with calibration.
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:15.200]   So I talked earlier about how I like to ask for a zero to 10 to find out am I in the ballpark
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:16.200]   or not?
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:21.860]   Well, one of my biggest liabilities as a diver was I was never satisfied with my score.
[02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:26.860]   And one day Eric said to me, "You hear Olympic judges or commentators talk about the perfect
[02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:27.860]   10?
[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:29.200]   That's a misnomer.
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.920]   If you look at the diving rule book, a 10 is for excellence, not for perfection.
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:35.040]   There's no such thing as a flawless dive.
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:38.600]   I can look at dives that have gotten straight 10s and point out 19 things that were wrong
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:40.900]   with them, but they were excellent."
[02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:42.860]   And so then we had to define the standards of excellence.
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:48.120]   So what I have as a recovering perfectionist, somebody who just beat myself up constantly,
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:52.720]   in fact, we did paper plate awards on my swim team.
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:57.500]   And one year I was given the if only award, and there's a little cartoon in me and it
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:01.160]   says, "If only I had pointed my left pinky toe, I would have gotten an eight and a half
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:02.700]   instead of an eight."
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:07.820]   And that was the story of my diving career, and I did not want to be that person anymore.
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:12.520]   And so one of the things I've learned to do is when I start anything, if I sit down to
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:15.820]   write a book, I'm aiming for a nine.
[02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:22.760]   And the reason for that is I'm going to pour a couple years of my work life into this topic.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:25.740]   Hopefully a lot of people are going to read it, and I want to make sure it's truly the
[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:28.180]   best work I can produce.
[02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:30.680]   Social media posts, I'm okay with a seven.
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.820]   If I'm only shooting for a nine, I'm not going to post very often.
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:39.140]   Because your nine, your ceiling for nine, or your threshold for nine is so exceedingly
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:40.140]   high.
[02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:41.140]   It's high.
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:42.140]   Yeah.
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:43.140]   And I want it to keep getting higher over time.
[02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:46.220]   It's much more challenging than it was 10 years ago.
[02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:51.380]   And I think this is what people probably don't do enough, especially if you're an extreme
[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:56.300]   perfectionist is they don't realize, "Okay, let me figure out how important this task
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:26:57.300]   is.
[02:26:57.300 --> 02:27:03.100]   And then for this task, a six is sufficient so that then I can pour my energy into pulling
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:07.100]   the seven and a half toward a nine where it really matters."
[02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:10.920]   And inevitably, if you don't do that, what you will do is you will get a bunch of nines
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:13.640]   on things that are completely trivial.
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:18.600]   - I went to a high school where we had a couple of kids get perfect on the SAT.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:22.840]   They would have the big centerfold list of all the early admissions to all the fancy
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:24.500]   Ivy League schools.
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:25.500]   Definitely was not on that list.
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:31.600]   I don't even know if I, yeah, I don't even know if I was anywhere near that list.
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:34.260]   Probably not.
[02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:38.480]   And some of them have gone on to have terrific lives and seem pretty happy.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:41.220]   And I know a number of them and in contact with them.
[02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:47.660]   I think for some of them that performed exceedingly well on standardized tests early on, I hear
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:50.420]   a bit more dismay in their current life.
[02:27:50.420 --> 02:28:00.060]   Not all, but I have to imagine there are data on early high performance being a seed for
[02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:01.060]   challenges later on.
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:06.920]   Obviously, you don't want the opposite, what I guess they refer to now as a complete failure
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:14.160]   to launch, people not meeting the milestones toward being self-sufficient adults.
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:19.800]   But what are some of the dangers of success when thinking about realizing one's larger
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:20.800]   potential?
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:23.500]   - Oh, that's such an interesting question.
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:27.500]   I think, yeah, I think the data on this go both ways.
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:32.900]   So some early success is, it's a motivator, it builds the kind of momentum you were talking
[02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:35.200]   about earlier.
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:39.060]   There's a goal setting researchers like Locke and Latham have talked about the high performance
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:45.340]   cycle where you hit a goal and then that builds your confidence and then you set a more ambitious
[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:48.680]   goal and then you reach it and there's this upward spiral over time.
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:54.100]   But there's also a mountain of evidence that achieving your goals can make you complacent.
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:58.980]   And sometimes it's called the fat cat syndrome where you end up resting on your laurels.
[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:03.320]   And then there are also competency traps where you get good at something and then you keep
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:06.720]   doing it the way you've always done it and you don't realize the world has changed around
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:07.720]   you.
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:10.100]   I'm allergic to the idea of best practices.
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:14.440]   The moment you call a practice best, you've created an illusion that you're done.
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:19.500]   And the moment, think about pre-COVID, a lot of companies had really what they thought
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:23.820]   were effective models for collaboration and all of a sudden their best practices are not
[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:27.600]   feasible because everybody's working remotely and they've got to throw that out the window
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:31.020]   and look for better practices for an evolved world.
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:37.380]   So I think those are the things I worry about most with early success.
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:41.920]   I think that one of the things I would love to see more people do when it comes to reaching
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:49.500]   potential is to figure out what does my failure budget look like?
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:53.100]   So I'll tell you my experience on this.
[02:29:53.100 --> 02:30:01.540]   I wrote a first book, gave a TED talk and pretty soon felt like I was spending 80% of
[02:30:01.540 --> 02:30:06.580]   my time saying things I already knew and I was getting typecast.
[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:10.220]   I'm like, "I'm not learning and growing, but I don't feel like I'm contributing new knowledge
[02:30:10.220 --> 02:30:11.220]   to the world.
[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:13.700]   What am I going to do about that?"
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:16.140]   And 2018 rolls around and I'm like, "You know what?
[02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:20.640]   I'm going to start a podcast and that will be my learning mechanism."
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.860]   And I didn't know if it was going to work.
[02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:23.700]   I didn't know how the medium would work for me.
[02:30:23.700 --> 02:30:25.780]   I didn't know if people were going to want to listen to my voice.
[02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:27.540]   I certainly don't.
[02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:30.500]   Maybe Morgan Freeman likes the sound of his own voice.
[02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:31.860]   I like listening to your podcast.
[02:30:31.860 --> 02:30:32.860]   Thank you.
[02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:38.540]   I also enjoy listening to yours, but I think everybody hates the sound of their voice.
[02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:42.740]   I just wasn't sure for a lot of reasons whether it was going to work.
[02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:49.660]   And then I thought about it and I realized, well, all of the pivotal moments in my career
[02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:52.260]   have come from taking a risk.
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:57.440]   And I thought that I needed to build the confidence in order to do it.
[02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:04.220]   And I was reflecting on goal-setting research as one does and realized, you know, like the
[02:31:04.220 --> 02:31:07.460]   confidence is going to come through doing it.
[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:08.620]   And so let me try it.
[02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:15.060]   And I guess what I took away was if I never fail, it means I'm not challenging myself.
[02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:17.340]   I'm not embracing discomfort.
[02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:19.920]   I'm not being enough of an imperfectionist.
[02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:24.700]   So I actually set a goal that I would start at least one project every year that didn't
[02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:25.700]   succeed.
[02:31:25.700 --> 02:31:27.980]   And let's be clear, I'm not aiming for failure.
[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:32.400]   What I'm doing is creating an acceptable zone of failure to know that that's going to motivate
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:36.300]   some risk-taking and some experimentation and hopefully some growth.
[02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:38.820]   And I know it's hard for a lot of people to do this in their lives, especially if you
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:45.220]   have a super demanding boss, but I think we're all better off from a growth and potential
[02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:49.940]   standpoint if we've got, you know, if you succeed on 90% of your projects, that should
[02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:51.980]   be a hugely successful year.
[02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:56.180]   If you succeed on 100%, I think you're aiming too low.
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:32:00.060]   - What are some of the projects that you are currently spinning in the back of your mind
[02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:06.680]   that would be fun, but if you're willing to share that for you still strike a little bit
[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:12.900]   of an anxiety chord, like, oh no, like, are you, I don't know, are you a musician?
[02:32:12.900 --> 02:32:13.900]   - Not at all.
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:16.580]   Can't carry a tune, can't keep a beat.
[02:32:16.580 --> 02:32:21.700]   - Are you thinking about becoming a musician or exploring, playing music?
[02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:27.820]   The reason I ask it that way is how far into your discomfort zone do you reach in order
[02:32:27.820 --> 02:32:30.720]   to challenge yourself?
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:33.060]   Because I think that everyone needs to have thresholds.
[02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:36.140]   There are a lot of things that, yeah, I wish I could play a musical instrument, frankly,
[02:32:36.140 --> 02:32:40.260]   but I'm not that motivated to do it, mostly because I enjoy hearing other people play
[02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.500]   music so much that I'm perfectly happy.
[02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:43.500]   I'm sated.
[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:46.280]   - Yeah, there's also enough good music out there you don't have to create.
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:48.700]   - There's definitely a lot of great music, yeah.
[02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:51.180]   - So I think there's a micro to macro version of this.
[02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:57.300]   So on the micro side, in the past year, I did this Work Life podcast for five years
[02:32:57.300 --> 02:33:02.380]   where I was taking the core of my organizational psychology work and trying to take on a topic
[02:33:02.380 --> 02:33:06.700]   and make it interesting and useful to people, and then realizing I was feeling constrained
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:10.140]   just to focus on work, and as a psychologist, there's lots of other things I want to take
[02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:15.420]   on, and so we expanded into the second show, Rethinking, and I have some experiments I'm
[02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:18.460]   tempted to try, but I've been really hesitant to do them.
[02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:20.900]   So did you watch wrestling growing up ever?
[02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:21.900]   - Professional wrestling?
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:22.900]   - Yeah.
[02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:27.740]   - I did watch a little bit of it, and then for whatever reason, in the last year, my
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:34.660]   good friend Rick Rubin, who's, he's not obsessed, but he is a real devotee, he's a fan of professional
[02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:35.660]   wrestling.
[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:38.960]   He had me watch some WWE, but even AEW.
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:43.620]   He was explaining that it's basically physical drama, he's explaining why it's so intriguing
[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:49.300]   to him and so informative to him, and then I'm a big fan of a certain genre of music,
[02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:53.940]   and Lars Fredricksen from Rancid is a huge wrestling fan, so now I've got multiple people
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:56.900]   that I've come into contact with who are like telling me all this stuff about wrestling,
[02:33:56.900 --> 02:33:59.020]   so wrestling seems to be cropping up more and more.
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:01.940]   - All right, so I don't know the first thing about wrestling, I think I caught it a few
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:02.940]   times as a kid.
[02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:08.060]   - Likewise, Hulk Hogan and a few others passed across the screen, yeah.
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:12.700]   - But the thing that I remember was loving the tag team matches, where somebody would
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:15.980]   get overpowered and then they pull in somebody to help.
[02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:20.400]   I think it would be so interesting if there was a podcast where you take issues that people
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:25.000]   fundamentally disagree on and you start a debate, and then somebody can tag in if they
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:31.080]   wanna challenge an argument, and so instead of concentrating on the particular guess,
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:35.440]   you basically have a problem you're trying to get to the roots of, and you're gonna have
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:39.860]   all these people jump in and hopefully build toward a more insightful perspective on it.
[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:44.280]   I have no idea if this is gonna work, I'd really love to try it, and this is the first
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:50.140]   time I've spoken out loud about it, because I'm like, I don't know that I wanna see that
[02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:52.540]   crash and burn, and yet, why not, what's the risk?
[02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:53.540]   - I think it's so cool.
[02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:54.940]   - It'll be fun, right?
[02:34:54.940 --> 02:34:58.620]   - Yeah, what topics are you thinking about covering?
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:02.620]   'Cause I can think of some pretty controversial topics, but I wanna know what the ones you're
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:03.620]   thinking about.
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:07.840]   - Well, I mean, I literally just, I mean, I'm thinking out loud here, but one that I
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:13.500]   think on the controversial front that could be really rich is to think about policies
[02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:16.140]   for trans athletes in sports.
[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:17.140]   - That's a controversial topic.
[02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:21.060]   - It's hugely controversial, but also, I've talked to some experts on this, I've talked
[02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:25.480]   to some trans athletes, and the people who are deep in this do not know what they think
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:31.800]   the policy should be, and so I think actually hearing them talk and understanding the complexity
[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:37.280]   of those issues and then maybe hammering out, what's a policy you would propose for schools,
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:42.060]   what would you want for Olympic events, I just think that would be fascinating, and
[02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:44.500]   I'd love to moderate that discussion.
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:45.500]   - Goodness.
[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:46.780]   - Maybe I wouldn't.
[02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:47.780]   - I wouldn't.
[02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:48.780]   - I don't wanna get into that one.
[02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:52.700]   - I'm glad you would, I wouldn't, that seems like one of the most barbed wire topics one
[02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:57.900]   could ever embark on, which is exactly why I'm gonna put in my vote, you absolutely should
[02:35:57.900 --> 02:35:59.220]   do this podcast.
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:02.560]   I think it's an amazing idea, actually folks, put in the comment section on YouTube whether
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:07.820]   or not Adam should do this podcast and that topic in particular, I think it would be amazing
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:13.340]   because one thing that I keep coming back to in my own mind is that a lot of the controversies
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:21.320]   out there stem from the fact that we very often have individuals pitted against individuals,
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:26.460]   and there's so much lost in that, and I think about science and going back to the scientific
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:32.820]   method where we have subfields pitted against subfields when you talk about a field, like
[02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:36.980]   there was huge controversy over the structure of DNA, and it wasn't one individual against
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:40.940]   another, what you had are small groups, different camps, and there was some partial overlap,
[02:36:40.940 --> 02:36:47.500]   there's also, if you read the double helix, there was also a lot of complicated behavior,
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:51.660]   people entering romantic relationships just to glean information from the other side,
[02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:59.860]   human beings not at their finest, but in any event, small panels arguing, competing, teams
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:06.980]   competing I think is far more interesting and informative than individuals butting heads.
[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:11.180]   - I think so too, and I think another one that I think would be really interesting,
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:15.820]   I mean people always say great minds think alike, no, great minds challenge each other
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:21.780]   to think differently, and we just don't do enough of that, so I've been thinking a lot
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:28.820]   politically, what if we brought together a bunch of people who are not ideologues but
[02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:33.660]   are really interested in pragmatic policy solutions to rewrite the constitution if we
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:35.140]   were going to build one today?
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:41.540]   - You'd like to tackle big stuff, no I love it, I love it, it's a compliment, it's a compliment.
[02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:47.980]   - Like I said earlier, no weak sauce, no weak sauce, you go right for it, listen these are
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:55.820]   the issues that people are really activated by because these are really core issues, they
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:59.620]   get down to the autonomic nervous system, they're in the hypothalamus as we say.
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:03.060]   - But I don't think they should be, I look at these topics and think, I just want to
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:07.620]   get it right, I don't have a vested interest in what the model should be, I just know that
[02:38:07.620 --> 02:38:13.500]   even the wisest people of 250 years ago were not prepared to anticipate the world we live
[02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:17.780]   in today, and we ought to be constantly, I don't know, I don't think you should live
[02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:21.480]   in a world where you affirm your beliefs, I think the only way you learn is by continually
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:25.760]   evolving your beliefs, and so I guess I'm trying to figure out more ways to catalyze
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.060]   that around issues people care about, but I don't care about the issues, I care about
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:33.220]   the stretching of thinking and the improving the way that the world works.
[02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:37.260]   - Well I'll tell you, if you decide to do this podcast with a tag team format, I love
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:43.300]   that you gleaned it from watching wrestling a couple of times around these very controversial
[02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:49.060]   issues, I promise you that will be one of the most popular and important podcasts on
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:53.000]   the planet Earth, it might be podcasts on other planets, I hear that there are galaxies
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.020]   far far away, they may have podcasts too, may have had them for much longer than we
[02:38:57.020 --> 02:39:01.500]   have, but that's a winner.
[02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:05.300]   - Well maybe I'll try it as a little experiment on the rethinking feed and see if it's an
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:08.560]   unmitigated disaster.
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:09.700]   - Well you know where my vote lies.
[02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:14.540]   - I appreciate that, so to go back to your question for a second, on the macro side,
[02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:18.300]   I've always thought it would be fun to try to write a sci-fi novel, and the question
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:21.940]   I'm wrestling with right now is is that a good use of my time, there are great sci-fi
[02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:26.340]   writers out there, there aren't that many social scientists communicating about the
[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:34.940]   topics that I do, and it feels like it might be, I don't know, it might be too much of
[02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:35.940]   a diversion.
[02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:43.940]   - Then again, according to your words, you had no talent in diving, but you exceeded
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:52.180]   all performance metrics by a considerable amount through motivation and opportunity,
[02:39:52.180 --> 02:39:59.220]   I got that right, I vote yes, I haven't read much sci-fi, maybe I need to read more sci-fi,
[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:00.220]   are you a fan of sci-fi?
[02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:06.780]   - I love sci-fi, it's one of my favorite ways to imagine a better world, and also prevent
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:14.380]   a worse one from emerging, but I don't know, there's a part of me that thinks, all right,
[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:18.020]   Ruth Bernstein and colleagues did this, do you know this research on Nobel Prize winning
[02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:20.740]   scientists and what differentiates them from their peers?
[02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:26.540]   - No, but being the son of a physicist and having been surrounded by, just by circumstance,
[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:31.500]   a number of Nobel Prize winners when I was a kid, young kid, I'm very curious to know
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:33.580]   what this research says.
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:38.020]   - I mean, there are many themes you could glean from it, but the thing that really jumped
[02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:43.460]   out at me is the Nobel Prize winners are more likely to have artistic hobbies.
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:44.460]   - Feynman certainly did.
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:49.420]   - Yep, I mean, there's a long list of them, but if you break it down in the data, it was,
[02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:53.780]   they're twice as likely as their peers to play a musical instrument, they're seven times
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:41:00.020]   as likely to draw or paint, they're 12 times as likely to do poetry or fiction, creative
[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:06.820]   writing, and get this, 22 times as likely as their peers, 22 to dance, act or yes, perform
[02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:07.820]   as magicians.
[02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:11.740]   - As a former magician, I was very excited about this right now.
[02:41:11.740 --> 02:41:14.620]   - Yeah, well, I wasn't going to ask you about magic, but let's talk about it.
[02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:18.740]   I was on vacation with, every year I take my sister in New York for her birthday and
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:23.100]   my birthday, 'cause our birthdays are close together, and we went and saw a magician mentalist
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:30.820]   by the name of Ozzy Wind, Ozzy, I think is the correct pronunciation, who just like the
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:33.580]   last time I saw him, absolutely blew my mind.
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:40.500]   There's no way, it's not magic, of course I know it's not magic, but my understanding
[02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:44.980]   is that there are some things that he and other great mentalists and magicians do where
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:49.960]   they are not absolutely certain of the outcome, they're playing, it's probabilistic.
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:54.180]   And so there's a risk and a thrill for them too, and that they're also creating memories
[02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:55.360]   and erasing memories.
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:00.080]   And that's something that I may host Ozzy on the podcast because he's very effective
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:02.820]   at creating memories and erasing memories.
[02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:05.720]   That's a lot of what he does and he has tactics to do that.
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:11.400]   In any event, I wasn't going to ask about magic, but I know that you were a professional
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:16.760]   magician at one point in your life and that you did this presumably 'cause you enjoy doing
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:17.760]   it.
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:22.540]   So getting beyond the sort of pull the rabbit out of the hat or identify the card that the
[02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:28.200]   person picked out of the shuffled stack, what is it and what was it about magic that intrigues
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.200]   you?
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.960]   Does it inform anything about the work that you do now?
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:32.960]   It does, yeah.
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:39.280]   I think when I started, I was 12 and it was just fun and I was looking for a way to entertain
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:43.300]   other people and entertain myself in the process and then it became a challenge, can I learn
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:46.760]   this new skill and can I master this trick?
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:52.440]   I think nerdiest thing I did in college was I started a magic club with David Kwong, who
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:57.480]   is a stellar magician and cruciverbalist, as he calls it.
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:42:58.480]   Cruciverbalist?
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:04.000]   He does magic crossword puzzles, essentially, that I can't do it justice, you have to see
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000]   it.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:06.000]   It's unreal.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:10.560]   And I watched him for our first performance together and realized one of us is going to
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:12.960]   make it as a magician and it's not me.
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:14.680]   He's outstanding.
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:19.360]   Anyway, the way it figures in my work now is I think so much of good science communication
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:23.600]   is misdirection and it's the same skill I used as a magician.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:29.300]   If I told you that the card you picked was about to disappear from the deck and appear
[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:35.200]   on the window, you would not be nearly as intrigued as if it happened by surprise.
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:37.800]   And I think the same is true when we communicate knowledge.
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:41.800]   I think it's actually why so many of my posts, you flagged this earlier, so many of my posts
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:47.080]   start with this thing is not what you think, it's actually this other thing.
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:51.960]   I think that challenging conventional wisdom, questioning assumptions is what surprises
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:56.720]   people and then leads them to think either I have something to learn or, oh no, I got
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:01.600]   to put up a shield because my beliefs are being challenged or attacked.
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:05.420]   And I think the art form of magic was always about creating a surprise that would delight
[02:44:05.420 --> 02:44:11.280]   people as opposed to leading people to feel like they were tricked or duped or manipulated.
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:15.320]   And so I think the challenge for me is to say, okay, I want to figure out what do we
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:22.200]   know from behavioral science, mostly focusing on psychology because that's my core expertise.
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:27.040]   What do we know that's actually different from most intuition and then how do I explain
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:31.520]   that in a way that surprises people but leads them to say, oh, that's so interesting as
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:35.360]   opposed to that's wrong and then want to fight about it.
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:41.040]   It's almost as if you give them the experience of what you're trying to teach them so that
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:50.860]   the, oh, that's wrong can't be the available response because in magic, everyone knows
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:57.480]   it's magic just like with professional wrestling folks, by the way, there's some prior understanding
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:44:58.720]   of what's going to happen.
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:03.400]   Maybe they go off script, but I think that's actually, I think part of the interest in
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:06.960]   professional wrestling for those that are extreme fans of professional wrestling is
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:13.640]   that they almost want to wonder about whether or not some of it is not in the plan.
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:17.520]   It's a suspension of reality that they seem to enjoy, right?
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:24.160]   Because if you know something's fake or, well, I should be more careful about my language
[02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:25.160]   with magic.
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:29.520]   Like when I went to see Aussie, I mean, I don't think it's actual magic, but he's able
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:31.880]   to give the illusion of magic.
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:34.680]   The real illusion is that it's magic, right?
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:39.480]   It's not the illusion of making the card hop to somewhere else in the room.
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:40.480]   And he is phenomenal.
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:43.940]   And I highly recommend people go see his show if they get the opportunity.
[02:45:43.940 --> 02:45:47.680]   But I think they're doing a documentary about him now, actually, there'll be some Netflix
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:49.600]   stuff as well.
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:55.240]   But it's the illusion that magic exists that's so exciting.
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.320]   So with science communication, I always aim for four things.
[02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:04.280]   I don't always achieve them, but, and I think you do as well, if I may, that a topic be
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:09.720]   interesting, clear, ideally actionable, but not always.
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:12.380]   And the quad facta is when it's also surprising.
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:16.080]   So interesting, clear, actionable, and surprising sort of is the ultimate if there's sort of
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:18.380]   a, like, oh, I didn't realize that.
[02:46:18.380 --> 02:46:22.120]   But it's hard to find data points that satisfy all four criteria.
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:24.920]   And the surprising is the least important by far.
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:28.000]   I assume table stakes is it's rigorous.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:34.360]   Oh, well, OK, sitting underneath all four of those points are that it's science, that
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:35.360]   it's actual science.
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:36.360]   Right.
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:37.360]   Someone didn't just say it.
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:38.360]   Right.
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.360]   It's not conjecture or theory.
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.720]   So that means that there's data to support it and that the data were collected with the
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:42.720]   appropriate amount of rigor.
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:43.720]   Right.
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:46.320]   So there's a there's a reservoir of stuff that sits underneath as a foundation.
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:52.320]   So given the baseline of rigor, how do I find what's interesting, clear, actionable and
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:53.320]   hopefully surprising?
[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:54.320]   Although I would.
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:55.320]   OK, I would make a case.
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:59.880]   There's a classic article that Murray Davis wrote, one of my all time favorites is a sociologist
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:01.360]   who wrote a paper called That's Interesting.
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:07.160]   And he opened the paper by saying ideas live not because they're true, but because they're
[02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:09.060]   interesting.
[02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:12.320]   Which decimated one of my core beliefs.
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:15.360]   I thought it was accuracy that drove people's beliefs.
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:19.600]   And he said, no, ideas live because they're interesting.
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:24.680]   And then he goes to build an index of the interesting to explain when people are intrigued.
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:27.720]   And his case is that most of interest is surprise.
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:31.320]   And he breaks down all the ways that you can turn conventional wisdom upside down.
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:36.180]   You can say that something you thought was bad was actually good or vice versa.
[02:47:36.180 --> 02:47:41.440]   You can argue that something you thought was homogeneous is actually heterogeneous.
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:44.720]   You could argue that something you thought was individual was actually a collective phenomenon
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:45.720]   or vice versa.
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:49.160]   And he's got this wonderful breakdown of of all the ways of being interesting.
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:53.260]   And he's the one who made the distinction between ideas that challenge weakly held assumptions
[02:47:53.260 --> 02:47:57.920]   intriguing you and strongly held assumptions sort of offending you.
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:03.680]   But I think from Davis's view, and I think he's right, a huge amount of interest is surprise.
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:05.660]   But I don't think it's the only driver of interest.
[02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:09.080]   So I might take your criteria and say, OK, we start with rigor.
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:12.280]   We want to go to interest, clarity, and actionability.
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:13.280]   How do we get to interest?
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:15.940]   Let's build a sub model of the factors that drive interest.
[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:20.920]   And surprise might have the biggest beta weight in the regression equation.
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:21.920]   But what else?
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:22.920]   What else drives interest?
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:23.920]   A couple hypotheses.
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:24.920]   I want to hear yours.
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:29.540]   You've been doing this actively and highly effectively beyond surprise.
[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:33.220]   What else interests people in your content?
[02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:39.260]   Anything that draws on self-reflection for them, I think we all have an innate desire
[02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:43.980]   to better understand ourselves, why we work the way we do, why we don't work as well as
[02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:48.800]   we would like to in certain domains like some and cast understanding on our experiences
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:51.820]   of others to like, oh, now it makes sense.
[02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:55.320]   Like I've been going back to the Conti episodes, but we did several of them.
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:49:01.540]   So I think it's appropriate to learn from him that narcissism is envy.
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:08.720]   It represents an extreme deficiency in the pleasure that narcissists can have an extreme
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:12.960]   pleasure drive, but they always feel like they have far less than they would like to
[02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:17.280]   have and that others have far more of it because they don't have that same yearning for it.
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:21.420]   And so that narcissism at its core is deep envy.
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:25.600]   That to me it was like, wow, you know, and to realize that and to now understand that
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:28.320]   all this discussion that you hear out there about narcissists, everyone calling other
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:32.720]   people narcissists, that there are genuine narcissists out there and what they really
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:39.480]   suffer from is an extreme deficit in pleasure and they're constantly envious of others.
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:43.860]   It reframed everything I thought about narcissists, about them being overbearing, which they can
[02:49:43.860 --> 02:49:46.300]   be and often are, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:53.120]   So I think it's also anything that leads to like, oh, I can navigate narcissists better
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:54.120]   with that.
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:55.920]   Well, I mean, that checks all your boxes.
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:59.040]   It's very surprising because it's not the way we normally understand narcissism.
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:04.840]   But I think you hit on, for me, what's the maybe even it's at least as important as surprise,
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:07.760]   maybe more so is self relevance.
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:09.680]   And it doesn't have to be actionable, right?
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:13.560]   It has to, in a lot of cases, just help you understand or make sense of something that's
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:21.440]   been puzzling or that's sort of I think I'm almost always surprised when I say something
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:26.880]   from here's a synthesis of research, here's a meta analysis.
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:30.740]   And I think it's kind of obvious and people get excited about it because it gave them
[02:50:30.740 --> 02:50:34.440]   language to describe something they had felt but they didn't know how to articulate or
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:36.040]   talk about.
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:41.920]   And I think that, I mean, I think this is why most of the most popular TED Talks are
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:46.080]   about human behavior because people are interested in people.
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:50.400]   And if you learn something about you or about others, you don't have to immediately do anything
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:56.760]   with that to find it intriguing and even useful because it enriched your worldview.
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:00.440]   - A recent guest on this podcast, we haven't aired it yet, but maybe it'll be out by time
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:03.040]   this airs was with Lisa Feldman Barrett.
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:04.040]   She's a psychologist.
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:05.460]   - Psychologist turned neuroscientist.
[02:51:05.460 --> 02:51:06.460]   - Right, studies emotion.
[02:51:06.460 --> 02:51:07.460]   - Emotion, of course.
[02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:14.220]   - And she described how in certain cultures there's a language for subcategories of emotions.
[02:51:14.220 --> 02:51:15.220]   - Emotional granularity.
[02:51:15.220 --> 02:51:20.700]   - Right, so she described a word in Japanese, I don't recall what the word was, that describes
[02:51:20.700 --> 02:51:25.420]   the feeling of sadness that one has after getting a particularly bad haircut.
[02:51:25.420 --> 02:51:29.220]   Something that I don't think you or I are familiar with but I'm familiar with from my
[02:51:29.220 --> 02:51:33.300]   experience of romantic partners being like really unhappy about their haircut and you're
[02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:39.200]   like, you're sad, but by having a specific word for a specific experience, people feel
[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:43.780]   less alone and the feeling passes more quickly in time.
[02:51:43.780 --> 02:51:49.900]   And then she gave some other examples from German and from Scandinavian languages and
[02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:50.900]   so forth.
[02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:51.900]   And I find this so interesting.
[02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:57.300]   It's like the moment people hear that they are not alone in an experience, there's nothing
[02:51:57.300 --> 02:52:03.640]   actionable about it but it creates a cognitive shift thereafter in which they suffer less
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:06.140]   or maybe feel more connected to others.
[02:52:06.140 --> 02:52:09.940]   I think it's really a beautiful example of exactly what you're referring to.
[02:52:09.940 --> 02:52:14.180]   When we learn about something and we identify with it, it's powerful.
[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:20.900]   - It's very powerful and I think psychologists often say name it to tame it.
[02:52:20.900 --> 02:52:24.420]   Affect labeling is one of the most effective emotion regulation strategies and when we
[02:52:24.420 --> 02:52:28.380]   talked about distraction and reframing earlier, I should have said there's a third strategy
[02:52:28.380 --> 02:52:33.840]   which is literally just to describe what you're feeling.
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:39.140]   It seems to allow people then to reason with and process whatever they're feeling as opposed
[02:52:39.140 --> 02:52:42.500]   to allowing the feeling to control them.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:47.100]   And I probably got the clearest sense of this in 2021.
[02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:53.540]   I read a New York Times article on languishing, the feeling of meh or blah.
[02:52:53.540 --> 02:53:01.540]   And I have never had anything, any article I wrote resonate like this and all the posts
[02:53:01.540 --> 02:53:05.300]   that tagged me were just like, "It me, it me, it us."
[02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:12.060]   And it was like one and two word reactions and I don't think it was the content that
[02:53:12.060 --> 02:53:15.700]   mattered to people, it was just having the term.
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:20.140]   All of a sudden people realize, this is originally Corey Keyes' research that I was referencing,
[02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:24.660]   but it had been a light bulb for me to say, if you think about the spectrum of well-being,
[02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:29.020]   this is related to your mental illness versus mental health distinction, those are two extremes
[02:53:29.020 --> 02:53:30.020]   of the continuum.
[02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:35.700]   And on one end we have depression and burnout, on another end we have well-being and flourishing.
[02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:39.220]   Languishing lives right in the middle, as Corey describes it, it's the absence of well-being.
[02:53:39.220 --> 02:53:44.980]   So you're not depressed, you still have hope, you're not burned out, you still have energy,
[02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:49.620]   but you're not at peak functioning, you're missing a sense of purpose, you feel like
[02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:52.420]   you're stagnating and you're empty.
[02:53:52.420 --> 02:53:57.180]   And there was something about just saying the word languishing that led people to realize,
[02:53:57.180 --> 02:53:59.820]   yeah, that's a thing.
[02:53:59.820 --> 02:54:03.400]   And of course we're languishing, we're standing still in the middle of a global experiment
[02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:10.560]   that no one opted into, which violates all rules of consent by science last time I checked.
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:15.800]   But I think that that's something that probably is underrepresented when we're trained to
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:19.980]   communicate as scientists, to say one of the most valuable things we do is we give people
[02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:20.980]   language to talk about things.
[02:54:20.980 --> 02:54:26.180]   And I think that's a massive part of your impact is, this is one of the big things I've
[02:54:26.180 --> 02:54:32.160]   learned from you, Andrew, is I used to be a little bit dismissive of cognitive neuroscience
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:33.380]   in particular.
[02:54:33.380 --> 02:54:37.760]   I thought understanding the brain has not taught me that much about the mind.
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:45.500]   Being able to trace, let's take a simple example, like when I read Joe Ledoux's research, being
[02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:54.480]   able to trace certain amygdala responses as the root of how people deal with fight or
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:58.340]   flight and threat, I'm like, I don't know that that helped me that much.
[02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:01.700]   If I could just describe fight or flight, do I need the amygdala?
[02:55:01.700 --> 02:55:05.120]   And you've convinced me I was wrong about that, because when people have, when they
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:10.880]   understand the neurological substrates of their thoughts, feelings, and actions, they
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:11.880]   believe them more.
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:14.160]   They're like, oh, there is a mechanism for this.
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:18.400]   It's being produced inside my head, and even though I can't see it, it's there and it can
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.460]   be studied with the tools of science.
[02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:25.160]   I think that's a really big deal, and I really regret the fact that I didn't spend more time
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:28.720]   on cognitive neuroscience, because I think I'd be a better psychologist today.
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:31.040]   Well, again, thanks for the kind words.
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:38.760]   I think that a fortunate evolution in our fields, or even field, if I may, over the
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:44.040]   last 10 years is that, whereas neuroscience itself even needs to be subdivided into neuroanatomy
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:49.960]   and neurophysiology, it's lumped into all neuroscience, but it now includes psychology,
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:55.080]   computational neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, it's all, you know, I consider us, you know,
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:58.760]   we have different perspectives and different training, obviously, but doing a lot of the
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:05.320]   same things, just using different dissection tools, and different language-based tools.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:10.640]   And listen, what you've done, I wouldn't even say masterfully, I mean, just with like extreme
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:15.840]   virtuosity is to wrap your hands around such an enormous literature related to psychology,
[02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:21.160]   I mean, the human mind and behavior and thought processes and emotions and potential and,
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:29.000]   you know, so many topics, and to extract the most valuable gems from that literature and
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.400]   communicate them in a way that anyone can understand.
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:38.780]   And it's an extreme gift to be able to do that, and it's clear it's working, because
[02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:42.460]   like, you mentioned this article on languishing, which we will provide a reference or a link
[02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:46.120]   to in our caption, 'cause I want to go read that now, I mean, I'm always struck by this
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:52.760]   feeling of like, am I, I'm not tired, but you know, like I've got tons to do, but like,
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:57.080]   why do I just want to like sit here for, and I'm like, maybe I need to sit here, but then
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:01.440]   you get into all the like the, well, okay, but you know, I need to, there's a lot to do,
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:04.920]   there's a lot to get up and go, I don't want to waste my life, and yeah, rest is good too,
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:09.760]   but I think languishing is something that like, I definitely can resonate with that.
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:14.800]   So when I had a bulldog, it felt a lot easier to do, 'cause he was always languishing, but
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:18.920]   do you ever just languish or are you busy enough that you just feel like you're always
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.320]   a forward center of mass?
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:23.640]   - I think everybody languishes, I think it's part of the human condition, and I think it
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:31.640]   might even be evolutionarily adaptive, because I remember another sort of mind-altering idea,
[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:36.160]   I remember reading Randy Nessie's argument that mild depression could be evolutionarily
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:42.760]   functional, that you know, obviously clinical depression is debilitating in a lot of ways,
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:49.120]   but low-grade sadness, Lincoln's melancholy, we know one of the things it can do is broaden
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:54.400]   your field of vision, and you know, for many people, sadness is a signal that something
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:58:00.080]   is not working, and it can motivate problem solving, it can in some cases open access
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:05.960]   to new perspectives, unfortunately those potential benefits of sadness are often overridden by
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:10.400]   the motivational cost, and also the fact that you now spend all this time regulating your
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:16.080]   sadness and wondering why you're sad, right, and so it's hard to harness, but I had a similar
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:20.760]   thought about languishing from this perspective, to say that, you know, maybe moments of languishing
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:26.660]   open us up to change, when we get stuck, sometimes we realize you have to move backward in order
[02:58:26.660 --> 02:58:33.480]   to make progress, sometimes you have to unlearn things that you thought you knew in order
[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:41.120]   to keep growing, and you know, I don't, a friend of mine said, he read my languishing
[02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:44.900]   piece, he's like, you're not the languishing type, I'm like, okay, maybe everybody's baseline
[02:58:44.900 --> 02:58:51.580]   is different, I think one of the things I'm really lucky to have is high reserves of energy,
[02:58:51.580 --> 02:58:58.200]   but for me, languishing is, I felt like I did nothing today, and you know, in a typical
[02:58:58.200 --> 02:59:03.080]   day, if I'm writing a book, I should be able to write a thousand words I'm proud of, and
[02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:07.960]   I don't like a single word that I produced, or I sat at my blinking cursor, like staring
[02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:12.920]   at the computer screen, and for the umpteenth time, wondered, did they call it a cursor
[02:59:12.920 --> 02:59:18.340]   because of all the writers who've cursed it, and then I end up googling, what's the, like,
[02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:21.920]   what are the Latin roots of the word cursor, where did this come from, and like, that is
[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:26.740]   not a good use of time, that's like, that's not forward mass, that's like, I'm spinning,
[02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:33.060]   so yeah, I think everybody languishes, and I aspire to do it less often, but not never.
[02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:36.940]   - Love it, what does cursor, what is the root of cursor?
[02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:41.720]   People look it up, put, hey folks, put it in the comments on YouTube.
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:42.720]   - I did look it up.
[02:59:42.720 --> 02:59:44.240]   - Oh, good, okay, you'll tell us now.
[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:48.440]   - No, I feel like there's a footnote in Hidden Potential, and I'm trying to remember, it comes
[02:59:48.440 --> 02:59:56.920]   from Courreray, I think, and the cursor originally came, nope, I don't wanna do it, I'm gonna
[02:59:56.920 --> 02:59:59.200]   skip it, I don't remember, captured it.
[02:59:59.200 --> 03:00:03.880]   - Your hippocampus is smart enough to have discarded that information, and you have more
[03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:07.080]   important things to do, forgive me for asking the question, folks, put it in the comments
[03:00:07.080 --> 03:00:09.480]   on YouTube, so good.
[03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:14.200]   I have one more question about potential, you have children, correct?
[03:00:14.200 --> 03:00:15.200]   - Three.
[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:21.360]   - And a lot of our listeners either are children, or have children, and even for those that
[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:27.360]   don't have children, I'm curious, with the vast array of knowledge that you now have
[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:34.080]   about potential, and the fact that kids are these incredible sponges, right, I mean, they
[03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:39.480]   certainly experienced discomfort, we know that, they are sponges, we absolutely know
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:44.920]   that, sometimes they're filters, we try and teach them to be filters, and hopefully they
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:49.440]   are imperfectionists, maybe there are kids that are just perfectionists by default, but
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:54.520]   I have to imagine that they are, because standards come about when we become aware of other people's
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:57.120]   performance, right?
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:04.880]   What sorts of messages do you recommend parents give their kids, and what sorts of messages
[03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:10.020]   are you actually implementing that perhaps are different than you were prior to researching
[03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:11.920]   and writing your book on potential?
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:16.840]   - Ooh, interesting, well the first thing I should say is, Becky Kennedy, Dr. Becky, is
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:23.440]   my favorite source of insight on parenting, and she's changed the way I think of, the
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:32.160]   way I think about a lot of what I do with our kids, but my wife Allison is, her instincts
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:38.440]   about effective parenting are so sophisticated, I feel like every day I learn something from
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:43.820]   watching her communicate with our kids, and so I came in thinking, all right, I'm gonna
[03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:47.900]   write this book about potential, I'm not gonna do a parenting chapter, because I want everything
[03:01:47.900 --> 03:01:54.220]   to be relevant to parents, and sure enough, there's a chapter that had nothing to do with
[03:01:54.220 --> 03:01:59.500]   parenting, where I was like, oh, actually, I'm reading this research, and there was a
[03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:04.140]   moment where I did something well, and I didn't even mean to do it, and this is something
[03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:10.040]   that I think everyone probably underutilizes, I don't wanna actually, that's an overstatement,
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:14.960]   I think a lot of people don't appreciate the importance of this approach to parenting,
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:20.540]   and I am trying to do it more often, so quick story, and then I'll back up into the principle,
[03:02:20.540 --> 03:02:27.360]   so I was getting ready to give my first TED Talk a number of years ago, extremely nervous,
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:32.920]   I'm a shy introvert, I was for a long time afraid of public speaking, I remember in college,
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:38.780]   literally shaking to raise my hand, being that nervous, and now I'm supposed to get
[03:02:38.780 --> 03:02:45.380]   in the red circle, not my idea of comfort zone, and happened to mention to our oldest
[03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:52.220]   daughter that I was nervous, and I asked her for advice on what I should do, and she said,
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:59.420]   I think at the time, let's see, she must have been, she was seven maybe, I think seven,
[03:02:59.420 --> 03:03:08.860]   maybe six, anyway, she said, look for a smiling face in the audience, so it was one of those
[03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:13.940]   moments where I'm like, oh, that's such a good idea, why didn't I think of that, yes,
[03:03:13.940 --> 03:03:17.140]   I can do that, I know people who are gonna be in the audience, so I asked a couple of
[03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:23.580]   friends to sit in the front rows, and I locked eyes with a couple of them, and my nerves
[03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:30.340]   went down a little bit, so a couple weeks later, Joanna's getting ready to be in a school
[03:03:30.340 --> 03:03:36.820]   play, and she's also shy and introverted, and she's nervous, and she asks us for advice,
[03:03:36.820 --> 03:03:41.740]   and instead of telling her what to do, I said, well, what did you suggest to me a few weeks
[03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:52.260]   ago, and she remembered, and she said, look for a smiling face, and it was one of the
[03:03:52.260 --> 03:03:59.020]   most moving moments of my life, like Allison and I got to the play, and she looked at us,
[03:03:59.020 --> 03:04:08.280]   and she beamed, and I just, I think what I learned from that experience was kids need
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:14.620]   to feel that they matter, and most of us think about mattering as showing kids that they're
[03:04:14.620 --> 03:04:19.780]   unconditionally loved, and giving them the support they need, but we forget that part
[03:04:19.780 --> 03:04:23.820]   of feeling that you matter is feeling that you make a difference, so as a kid, feeling
[03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:29.380]   like you have something to contribute, as a parent asking my daughter for advice, that
[03:04:29.380 --> 03:04:35.660]   boosted her confidence, and I think that this is, I've come to call this the coach effect,
[03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:40.260]   it's one of my favorite recent findings in psychology, that when you're struggling with
[03:04:40.260 --> 03:04:45.460]   something, your instinct is to go to somebody else for advice, and say, I need guidance,
[03:04:45.460 --> 03:04:49.300]   the problem is that keeps you in a passive frame of mind, it makes you feel like you're
[03:04:49.300 --> 03:04:54.020]   dependent on others, what you're better off doing is finding somebody else with a similar
[03:04:54.020 --> 03:04:58.580]   challenge and giving them advice, and what that does is it shows you that you have something
[03:04:58.580 --> 03:05:04.580]   to give, it boosts your efficacy, the research on this by Lauren Escris Winkler and colleagues
[03:05:04.580 --> 03:05:10.100]   is fascinating, so people who give advice instead of receiving it, randomly assigned,
[03:05:10.100 --> 03:05:14.860]   end up more motivated and more confident, and I think this is something every parent
[03:05:14.860 --> 03:05:18.840]   could do, right, whatever challenge you think your kid is going to face, find a version
[03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:22.940]   of it that you're grappling with, and seek their guidance on it, and when they run into
[03:05:22.940 --> 03:05:26.820]   that same challenge, they will have confidence that they can begin to figure it out on their
[03:05:26.820 --> 03:05:31.000]   own, and you can be a coach in that process, as opposed to just telling them what to do,
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:35.640]   which they may feel like is not relevant, or they may resist because they don't want
[03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:40.540]   to be told what to do by a parent, so that is my favorite parenting lesson from Hidden
[03:05:40.540 --> 03:05:41.540]   Potential.
[03:05:41.540 --> 03:05:48.680]   - I love that, and I love your statement that kids, like adults, want to matter, that being
[03:05:48.680 --> 03:05:54.260]   it, we hear, make them feel important, but so often that's tied to performance metrics,
[03:05:54.260 --> 03:05:57.940]   and those performance metrics are the very things that are making them nervous, or that
[03:05:57.940 --> 03:06:02.460]   are creating anxiety, I love it.
[03:06:02.460 --> 03:06:07.340]   Are you taking additional kids for adoption, 'cause I'm raising my hand.
[03:06:07.340 --> 03:06:11.180]   - I think there'd be a lot more developmental psychologists in the world if we chose our
[03:06:11.180 --> 03:06:14.540]   careers later.
[03:06:14.540 --> 03:06:17.780]   - Super interesting topic, and by the way, I'm very much looking forward to reading your
[03:06:17.780 --> 03:06:24.520]   book, Hidden Potential, clearly I have a lot to resolve around that issue, because I still
[03:06:24.520 --> 03:06:31.160]   hear Ms. Rolf in middle school just telling me how much potential we have, and that I
[03:06:31.160 --> 03:06:36.280]   wasn't accessing mine, oh no, it's like a voice in the back of my head all the time,
[03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:41.360]   and even though I feel very happy with many aspects of my life, that there are a lot of
[03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:48.060]   things that I want to do that I haven't done, and I think it's through limited, what do
[03:06:48.060 --> 03:06:50.780]   they call it, limiting self beliefs, or things of that sort.
[03:06:50.780 --> 03:06:51.780]   - Self limiting beliefs.
[03:06:51.780 --> 03:06:55.380]   - Self limiting beliefs, there you go, I can't even say the phrase.
[03:06:55.380 --> 03:07:00.940]   - I do think all your fans are like, yeah, that Andrew Huberman, he hasn't really tapped
[03:07:00.940 --> 03:07:03.420]   his potential at all, he's squandering it all.
[03:07:03.420 --> 03:07:08.340]   - Well keep in mind, I've lived in a fairly narrow trench of pursuit, at 19 I got into
[03:07:08.340 --> 03:07:13.760]   this, and I've been doing this, researching and teaching, it's pretty much all I've done
[03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:18.580]   for almost, you're heading into 30 years, and you too, you've been in this game for
[03:07:18.580 --> 03:07:23.860]   a long time, and it's where we like to play, but what I've learned from you today, in addition
[03:07:23.860 --> 03:07:30.640]   to many other things, is that realizing our potential has so much to do with reaching
[03:07:30.640 --> 03:07:36.440]   outside, we hear about our comfort zone, but it's also reaching into our deeper wishes
[03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:42.300]   and thoughts, and I keep coming back to this idea of the tag team podcast, and the origins
[03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:46.440]   of that in your mind, it's like, I never would have expected that, but it also reveals something
[03:07:46.440 --> 03:07:52.440]   that sounds kind of intrinsic to you, like maybe you like to see things play out the
[03:07:52.440 --> 03:07:57.700]   way you think they should be played out, as opposed to what's clearly a intractable battle
[03:07:57.700 --> 03:07:59.160]   of loggerheads these days.
[03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:05.420]   - Yes, that's a core value, I think, I can't imagine an unsolvable problem.
[03:08:05.420 --> 03:08:14.120]   Oh, I love that, man, I want your brain, listen, Adam, I want to thank you, first of all, for
[03:08:14.120 --> 03:08:17.700]   taking the time today to come talk to us, certainly not just about your book, but we
[03:08:17.700 --> 03:08:22.980]   covered an enormous range of topics, I mean, you talked to us about procrastination, which
[03:08:22.980 --> 03:08:29.420]   is sort of the third rail of life for so many people, creativity, intrinsic, extrinsic motivation,
[03:08:29.420 --> 03:08:34.440]   and blind spots, authenticity, and so much more, but also I want to thank you for being
[03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:42.200]   such an active teacher on social media in the classroom, you still run a research program,
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:46.520]   you're doing TED Talks, you're writing multiple books, you're an absolute phenom in terms
[03:08:46.520 --> 03:08:51.520]   of the amount of information that you're putting out into the world, and I must say, I always,
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:55.640]   always, always learn from your posts, your podcasts, your books, like there are certain
[03:08:55.640 --> 03:08:59.040]   people in the world, they're exceedingly rare, but you're one of them, that when they open
[03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:04.140]   their mouth, people learn, and they learn valuable knowledge, and it's an incredible
[03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:09.340]   thing to be on the receiving end, and so I just want to say, on behalf of myself and
[03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:14.140]   everyone else, thank you ever so much for what you do, and please keep going.
[03:09:14.140 --> 03:09:18.400]   - Well, thank you, that means a lot to me, considering the source, 'cause the sentiments
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:24.760]   are mutual, I think, every time, whether it's reading one of your posts, or seeing one of
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:30.960]   your reels, my overwhelming thought is, that as a master teacher, and if I had been lucky
[03:09:30.960 --> 03:09:36.980]   enough to take one of your classes, I might've gone more of the neuroscience direction, and
[03:09:36.980 --> 03:09:37.980]   then failed.
[03:09:37.980 --> 03:09:38.980]   - No, no.
[03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:42.600]   - But it would've been interesting to learn more about at minimum, and I just have tremendous
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:48.500]   admiration for your commitment to making science interesting, clear, and useful to people.
[03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:55.660]   - Thank you, well, I consider us on the same team in that regard, and I probably will tap
[03:09:55.660 --> 03:09:58.360]   you about a potential collaboration, it'd be so much fun--
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:09:59.360]   - Sounds like a blast.
[03:09:59.360 --> 03:10:05.740]   - To work together, meanwhile, again, thank you for everything you're doing, and like
[03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:09.820]   I said, just keep going, and please come back again, I feel like there are a thousand other
[03:10:09.820 --> 03:10:12.020]   topics we could talk about, and that we should.
[03:10:12.020 --> 03:10:15.260]   - Honored, we'll try not to make you regret that.
[03:10:15.260 --> 03:10:16.260]   - Thank you.
[03:10:16.260 --> 03:10:19.740]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Adam Grant.

[03:10:47.860 --> 03:10:50.940]   section on YouTube, I do read all the comments.
[03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:55.300]   Not on today's episode, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss
[03:10:55.300 --> 03:10:59.200]   supplements, while supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:04.160]   benefit from them, for things like improving sleep, for hormone support, and for focus.
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:07.960]   To see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to Live Momentus,
[03:11:07.960 --> 03:11:12.320]   spelled O-U-S, so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:17.000]   If you're not already following me on social media, I am @hubermanlab on all social media
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:21.520]   platforms, so that's Instagram, X, Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:25.740]   And on all those platforms, I discuss science and science-related tools, some of which overlaps
[03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:29.700]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:11:29.700 --> 03:11:31.080]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:34.580]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

[03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:49.220]   The toolkits are brief PDFs that you can download that give you tools for things like neuroplasticity
[03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:54.120]   and learning, for managing dopamine, for enhancing sleep, for physical performance, flexibility,
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:11:56.080]   deliberate cold exposure, and on and on.
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:12:00.280]   To join the neural network newsletter, you simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu

[03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:08.520]   Once again, thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Adam Grant.
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:13.500]   I hope you found the conversation to be as informative and practical as I did.
[03:12:13.500 --> 03:12:16.520]   And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
