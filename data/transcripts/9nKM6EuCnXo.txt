[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.120]   the Gospel according to St. John in the fifth chapter and the fortieth verse.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.040]   The fortieth verse in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:29.980]   And ye will not come to me that ye might have life, and ye will not come unto me that ye
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.980]   might have life.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.160]   Our Lord, do you remember, uttered those words immediately after he had made the previous
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.960]   statement, "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.000]   are they which speak of me."
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.660]   And ye will not come to me that ye might have eternal life.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.620]   Now our Lord here, as we saw last Sunday evening when we considered this verse together, our
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:19.220]   Lord here, having said a number of things to these Jews, having produced his evidence,
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:30.260]   his witnesses to prove that he is indeed the Son of God, now turns to them and begins to
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.500]   address them more directly.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.220]   He virtually says to them, "Well, here it is, I've put it all before you, and still
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:50.180]   you will not come to me, you will not believe on me, that I may give you life."
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.500]   We last Sunday night spent our time in considering this extraordinarily interesting manner in
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.780]   which our Lord made this statement, the form in which he put it.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.140]   And what we saw was this, that being a Christian rarely means coming to Christ.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.820]   That's the term, "Ye will not come to me."
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.020]   But as we saw, it's a very great term.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.540]   It's a term that can be used very glibly and very loosely, but it's a very great
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.700]   and a very profound term, "coming to Christ."
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   Very well, we've considered that together, all that that means and all that that involves
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.340]   in practice.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.460]   But still, you see, the point our Lord makes is this, that though he has gone on appealing
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:51.300]   to them, though he has been calling them to come to him in this amazing way, through his
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.460]   miracles, through his teaching, through his preaching, through everything that he is and
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:07.140]   everything that he has done, still, they will not come to him.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.820]   And though he therefore begins to show them the reason why they will not come, they think
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.980]   they've got their reasons, and they think they're very powerful ones.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.780]   But our Lord proceeds to show them that the reasons which they give are entirely wrong,
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.300]   and that the true reasons for their failure to come to him to receive life are indeed
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.140]   something very different from that which they have imagined.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.260]   And I want to consider these reasons with you.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.620]   And let me say that I have but one object in doing so.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.780]   It is just this.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.020]   The most terrible thing that can ever happen to any one of us in this world is to go out
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.540]   of it without having come to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.420]   There is nothing worse than that, according to his own teaching, according to the teaching
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.500]   of the Bible everywhere.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.460]   There is nothing more terrifying, more awful, more tragic, than I say, to go out of life,
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:22.660]   out of the world, without having come to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.260]   Very well then, what can be more important than that we should understand something about
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.420]   and realize something of this terrible condition?
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.340]   And that is my sole reason for putting it before you this evening.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.860]   Our Lord, I take it, had precisely the same reasons as he put the matter like this before
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.700]   those Jews that were standing back there instead of coming to him.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.900]   He was anxious for them to see the enormity of their position.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.620]   He wanted them to see the thing as it really is.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.660]   So he analyzed it for them.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.420]   He said, "Now these are the real reasons why you don't come.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.980]   And it is because they are still the true reason that I am calling your attention to
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.980]   them."
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.660]   Let's look at these Jews.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.220]   Can you conjure up the picture?
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.220]   Here is the very Son of God standing before them and preaching.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.340]   He has just worked a mighty miracle, healing that man who had been paralyzed for 38 years
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.700]   at the pool of Bethesda, there in Jerusalem.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.260]   Yet in spite of it all, they will not come to him.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.700]   They are arguing against him.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.020]   They are trying to say that he is breaking God's law and that he is some sort of an
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.020]   imposter.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.020]   They are standing back.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.220]   They will not come to him.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.020]   Can you imagine anything more terrible, more tragic than that?
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.540]   Well now then, let's follow our Lord as he analyzes them.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:03.380]   Because as I say, what he had to say about those people standing there is the simple
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:12.220]   truth still about all those who are not Christian.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.700]   What is it that accounts for the fact that there is anybody in the world this evening
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.980]   who is not a Christian and who does not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.780]   Why will they not come to him that they may receive life?
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:34.300]   Well, the first answer that he seems to give is a negative one.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.180]   You notice how he puts it.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.180]   He says, "You will not come unto me."
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.740]   So that my first reason is this.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.420]   It is not intellectual.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.660]   Now I put it in that form quite deliberately.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.220]   I am probably speaking to someone who is not a Christian.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.980]   And if I were to ask you to give me your reasons for not being a Christian, I have no doubt
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.340]   at all but that some or another you would put it in some terms of your intellect and
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.940]   your understanding.
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.460]   That is what people still think is the true reason for their not being Christian.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.140]   It was the reason with these people.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:30.100]   They think it's a matter of their minds, their intellect, their knowledge, and their understanding.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:39.020]   But our Lord here is at pains to show and to prove that that is never the real reason.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.620]   It's something much bigger, something much deeper, something much more terrible.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.740]   But let us deal with this.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.060]   We must be clear about this.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:56.620]   Why do I say that it is never an intellectual reason?
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:02.340]   Why am I thus challenging typical modern thought?
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:08.700]   Because as I say, this is the reason that people imagine that they have for not being
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.700]   Christian.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.740]   Well, it seems to me that there are certain things which suggest themselves at once that
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.100]   ought to be sufficient to dispose of this position once and forever.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.020]   Here is one.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:29.660]   If the reason for not being a Christian is the possession of a mind and a brain and an
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:39.460]   intellect, well then it would follow of necessity, wouldn't it, that anybody who is a Christian
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:46.980]   is unintelligent, is lacking in intellect, hasn't got a brain, and is incapable of reason.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.780]   Now, I think you'll all have to agree, whether you're Christian or not, that that is an
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.380]   inevitable deduction.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.340]   If the supreme reason for your not being a Christian is because you've got such a brain
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.780]   and understanding, well then it must follow that the other man who is a Christian is a
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:14.660]   Christian because he lacks all that brilliant intellect and intelligence and understanding.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:25.980]   And that, of course, in turn leads me to say this, that it is just not true.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.700]   History proves that that isn't true.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.820]   As I've often pointed out from this pulpit before, you read the history of the Christian
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:41.260]   church and you come into contact with some of the greatest minds, the greatest intellects
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.780]   that this world has ever known.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.820]   How can it be, therefore, a matter of intellect?
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.820]   You've got to establish that I or anybody else who is a Christian is just a fool who
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.140]   can't think and who can't reason.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.860]   What a monstrous position to be in.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.900]   But I have a second reason.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:13.700]   If this were merely a matter of intellect, how grossly and entirely unfair it would be.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.140]   If the thing that determines whether a man is a Christian or not is his brain and his
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.660]   intellect and understanding, well, isn't it clear that there would be a very great
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.660]   inequality?
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.260]   We all are not gifted with the same brain power.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.180]   Obviously some are much more intelligent and more intellectual than others.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.180]   We can't help that.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.940]   We are born like that.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.940]   But there it is.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.620]   There is this marked and there is this striking inequality.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.380]   There is a man who is given great intellectual ability.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.580]   There are other people who are practically none.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.220]   Now then, if being a Christian and having eternal salvation were a matter of intellect,
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.740]   well, how utterly unfair it would be.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:01.460]   At what a great advantage would these rare people be who have these great minds and brains
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.460]   and intellects.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.700]   How hopeless would be the position of the vast majority.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.860]   What hope would there be for someone in the heart of Africa who has never been taught
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.380]   and never been trained in any respect and whose mind has never had any opportunity of
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.820]   developing and advancing.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.860]   You see, at once the whole thing would be utterly unequal.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:30.520]   That's an inevitable deduction to draw if you say that you're not a Christian because
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:38.100]   of your brain and your intellect and your understanding.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.140]   And then there is another reason which seems to me to be very powerful at this point.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.620]   Oh, how important it is that we should examine these positions that we take up.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.580]   The average man today just takes it for granted.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.780]   "Of course," he says, "those people, they still believe in Christianity.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.780]   Poor things.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.180]   It's just because they're unintelligent."
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.300]   But he's never examined the thing, and that isn't a sign of intelligence.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.700]   That's the failure to be intelligent.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.580]   Now I'm asking you to think and to reason and to be intelligent and to apply your mind
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.740]   to the position that you take up.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.500]   But here is another one.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.860]   What is there about this gospel that makes it inherently something that an intellect
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.180]   must reject?
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:26.380]   Is this nonsense?
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.660]   Is this a form of gibberish?
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.220]   Is there some essential contradiction here?
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.140]   Is there anything here that in any way is insulting to the mind and the intellect of
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.140]   men?
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.660]   Well, I have only to ask my question to answer the question.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:51.460]   We know perfectly well that in this book there is that which has stimulated the mightiest
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.740]   minds, I say, of all the ages, and has drawn them out, and having read and having studied,
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.980]   they all stand back with the apostle Paul at the end and confess, "Great is the mystery
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.980]   of godliness.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.980]   It's so vast.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.980]   It's so glorious.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.980]   It's so immense."
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:17.100]   No, no, it's not a question of mind and of intellect.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.200]   That's not the determining factor.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.900]   And if I would adduce a final argument, it is just this one.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.780]   And this in and of itself would have been quite enough.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.700]   What happens when a man becomes a Christian?
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.940]   Think of a man who up to a point is not a Christian.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.900]   "Rubbish," he says, "nonsense, nothing in it."
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.500]   And because of his great brain, he can't possibly believe it and accept it.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:51.460]   But then I show you that same man later on a Christian, and rejoicing in it, what's
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.460]   happened to him?
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:58.340]   Has his brain suddenly vanished?
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.840]   Has he suddenly lost his intellectual power?
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.300]   Has he suddenly become a fool?
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.680]   Is he now incapable of reason and logic and investigation and understanding?
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   Of course he isn't.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.540]   He is exactly the same man as regards his intellect.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.120]   And his intellectual power and ability is in no sense diminished.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.920]   Indeed, as I am hoping to show you, it is greatly enhanced.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.400]   Well very well then, our Lord says, "That isn't the reason."
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.320]   Well if it isn't intellect, I wonder whether it is some special knowledge.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.720]   So many say that today.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.740]   They say it's because of all this vast knowledge and learning that has come to us in the twentieth
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.320]   century, that they cannot possibly be Christian.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.280]   I don't want to keep you with this.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.520]   I simply answer that by saying this.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.440]   I issue it as a challenge.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:00.240]   What knowledge has become available in this twentieth century that makes Christianity
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   impossible?
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.680]   I'd like to know what it is.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.520]   I've never heard of it yet.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.760]   I haven't discovered it.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:13.120]   I know of no knowledge, scientific or any other type of knowledge, that in any way causes
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.320]   me the slightest difficulty about believing this book which we call the Bible.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.920]   I'd like to know what it is.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   There isn't any.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.440]   "Oh, but you see, but we now have split the atom."
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.120]   All right, I'm well aware of it.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.920]   But what's that got to do with the being of God?
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.680]   What's got to do with you being as a man?
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.960]   What does that tell you about your soul?
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.800]   What does that tell you about death?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.280]   It can produce death, but it doesn't tell you anything about death.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.960]   What does that tell you about life beyond death?
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   Nothing at all.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.720]   You see, it's all very well to say, "Ah, but science doesn't touch these matters at all.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.760]   It's got nothing to do with it."
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.400]   It's completely irrelevant.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.200]   There is no new knowledge that has come in this century, and let us thank God for all
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:09.000]   the knowledge we've got, but none of it has any relevance at all to these matters that
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.240]   are dealt with in the Christian faith and in the Christian Bible.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.240]   Completely irrelevant.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.520]   Very well, you see, but people stand on that to say, "I'm not a Christian because of my
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:26.160]   knowledge," as if nobody else had the knowledge, as if Christians were complete ignoramuses
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.400]   and as if you couldn't have at one and the same time an atomic scientist and a Christian.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.280]   But there are such men.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.240]   How glibly we say these things.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.560]   But how flimsy are their arguments the moment you face them and the moment you begin to
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.160]   examine them.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:50.680]   And then, let me put it like this, people talk about their difficulties and their problems,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.400]   and these are always intellectual.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:01.200]   But still I ask, what problem is there, what difficulty, what perplexity, which you have
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.080]   as a non-Christian, which is not known to us who are Christians?
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.480]   I listen to many questions and I'm always glad and delighted to do so, but I can say
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.160]   this honestly from this pulpit.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:18.960]   I have never had a question put to me but that I've already faced it many times over.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.640]   I'm aware of them all.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.080]   It is in spite of my knowing them all that I yet am a believer, so I argue it isn't
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.520]   those questions that prevent you from being a believer.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:35.520]   And yet, you see, these are the things that men fondly imagine are the real reasons for
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.080]   their not coming to Christ.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.120]   Very well then, let's leave the negative and come to the positive.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.080]   What are the reasons?
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.040]   If those are not the reasons, what are the reasons?
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:59.920]   Here our Lord begins to speak and he points out that the real reason is very much deeper
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.920]   than all those.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.920]   Where is the reason?
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.280]   Oh, he says the reason is in the will.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.000]   He will not come unto me.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.480]   It's something altogether deeper in men's constitution than his mere brain and intellect
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.480]   and understanding.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.520]   You see, the whole fallacy today is to think of men as if he were nothing but some sort
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:27.760]   of a machine, a brain, in a kind of vacuum, and he's a pure intellect.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.920]   But man isn't a pure intellect.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.880]   You analyze your life and you'll find it's not governed by intellect.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:41.040]   There are other forces and factors much deeper, much stronger and more potent in us all, that
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.560]   influence our understanding and our will and everything.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.920]   There, says our Lord, is the reason why you won't come.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.880]   You will not come unto me.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.840]   Here it is, I say, down in the depths of our personality.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:03.160]   Now this is something that is emphasized everywhere in the Scripture from beginning to end, and
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:09.120]   there is nothing that is more important than this.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:18.200]   The modern man who is not a Christian humbly imagines that he has freedom in the realm
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.560]   of thought and freedom in the realm of will.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.760]   I, says the modern man, unlike these Christians who've been brought up to it and who just
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:37.800]   have swallowed it all without thinking at all, I, says the modern man, I am a free thinker,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.280]   and I read the literature of the Rationalist Press Association.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   Free thought.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   I am not governed by these shibboleths and I'm not tied down by what men have thought
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   in the past.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   I approach everything in a new and in a scientific manner.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:00.920]   I claim that I have free thought, and likewise he claims that he's got a free will.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:06.400]   In other words, his attitude is that, well, as a free man, he's prepared to consider the
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:12.320]   case of the Gospel, so he's prepared to read the Bible, he's prepared to listen to preaching,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:18.560]   he's prepared to read books about this in absolute freedom with this scientific detachment,
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.680]   entirely free in all his processes, thinking and willing.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.320]   And he says, well, of course, if I wanted to, I could become a Christian.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.040]   I could say, yes, I'm going to join your church.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.480]   I'm going to be a Christian.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.120]   If I wanted to, I could.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.080]   Now, says Christ, that's where you go wrong.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.680]   You're not free.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   You're slaves.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.080]   You're not free in your minds.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.560]   You're not free in your wills.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.160]   You will not come unto me.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.120]   Why won't you come unto me?
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.040]   And the answer that he gives everywhere, and it's everywhere else in the New Testament,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:06.800]   is this, that man is not free.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:16.920]   Man is the slave of the devil, and he is the slave of sin.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.240]   Did you notice how it was put in that twelfth chapter of John, this Gospel, which I read
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.240]   to you at the beginning?
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   There it's put quite explicitly, "But though he had done so many miracles before them,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.680]   yet they believed not on him, that the saying of the prophet, Esaias might be fulfilled,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.880]   which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.040]   And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:48.800]   Therefore they couldn't, they could not believe, because, as Esaias says again, he hath blinded
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.280]   their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.920]   with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:06.720]   There's no such thing as freedom of thought and freedom of the will.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:17.520]   The whole case which is put by the Bible is this, that when man fell, he lost his freedom.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.680]   Adam was free.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:26.000]   Adam was made perfect, and a part of his perfection was that he had a free will.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.600]   But the moment Adam listened to the serpent, to the devil, he lost his freedom.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.000]   He lost his freedom of thought, he lost his freedom of will.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.480]   He has been a slave of the devil and a slave of sin, and he's not free.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.840]   He cannot believe.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   He's not in a detached position.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.680]   He's not in this supposed scientific position, when he can look on in this dispassionate
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   manner.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.120]   No, no, he's hopelessly biased.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.560]   That is the position taken up by the Bible everywhere.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.080]   Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.160]   You see, the Apostle Paul preached this gospel.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.360]   Everybody didn't believe it.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   There were people who hated him for preaching it.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.800]   There were people who rejected it with scorn.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.160]   They called him a babbler.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.920]   They poured their ridicule upon it, and the Apostle, knowing that he wrote like this to
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:23.760]   the Corinthians in the second epistle, chapter four, he says, "If our gospel be hid,"
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:30.640]   because it is hid to some, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:39.000]   whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest they
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.680]   believe the glorious gospel of Christ."
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.800]   Very well then, here is the position, says our Lord.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.360]   You will not, you cannot.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.360]   Why?
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:55.200]   Well, because you're the slaves of the devil and the slaves of sin.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.680]   How does this slavery work?
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.840]   Well, here are the two terms that are used.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.720]   The first thing that the devil does to us is to blind us.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.600]   The God of this world hath blinded the mind.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.680]   You see, the difficulty is not with the mind as such.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.960]   It's what the devil has done to the mind.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.600]   The mind is all right, but if the mind is diseased, it cannot function.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.280]   Look at the man there, suffering from an acute illness.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.440]   He's talking nonsense.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.280]   He's in a state of delirium.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   What's the trouble with the man?
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.760]   Is his trouble in his mind?
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   No, no.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.800]   His mind, as it were, is still all right, except that it's been poisoned.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.160]   For the time being, the poison of the disease that he's suffering from is rendering his
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.980]   mind incapable of its normal action.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:54.520]   The moment the disease is cured, the man's mind is perfect as it was before.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.600]   That's the kind of thing that sin and Satan do to the mind.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:09.200]   They produce this fatal and this feral blindness, this inability to see and to understand.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   What?
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.580]   Well, I only mention these things this evening.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.280]   Why didn't those Jews believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.920]   Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:34.440]   It was because they were blind to their state and to their condition and to their danger.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.000]   They thought that they were pleasing God, that they were good and religious people,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.960]   and they didn't want to listen to these men.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.160]   What was the trouble with them?
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:51.580]   Well, I say the trouble with them really was that they didn't know that they were lost,
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.840]   that they were dead in trespasses and sins, and that if they died like that, they would
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.960]   face God in the judgment and be condemned.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.080]   Our Lord said later on, as you noticed in the twelfth chapter, he says, "I haven't
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.400]   come into the world to condemn the world," but you know, he says, "I'll tell you
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.600]   what will condemn you.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.440]   The word that I have spoken to you, it will rise up against you and condemn you in the
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440]   judgment."
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   Why?
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.020]   Because I told you, but you wouldn't listen.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:23.500]   You wouldn't believe.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.620]   That's why people are not Christians.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:35.700]   It isn't because they've got great brains and great minds and great intellect.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:41.980]   It's because they don't realize the truth about themselves and their sinfulness.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.700]   They don't face themselves.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.260]   You see, it's about time I think we began to protest about these people who are protesting
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.180]   on grounds of morality against the atomic bomb.
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.540]   Who are they to talk about morality, passing as they've done, many of them, through the
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.020]   divorce court so frequently?
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:05.060]   They are in no position to make a moral protest.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.660]   But they don't realize that.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.700]   They stand objectively and talk about the moral iniquity of the atomic bomb.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:19.820]   They've never faced their own lives, their own infidelity, and their own moral treachery.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.740]   They're blind to it.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.460]   They don't see it.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:30.620]   Still less do they see that with all their gifts and their intellects and their brilliant
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:37.500]   philosophizing that they've got to die like everybody else, and after that they stand
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.540]   in judgment before God.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.820]   Who will examine them about these things that they don't believe?
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.860]   I'll tell you why people are not Christian.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.580]   It isn't because of their gigantic intellects.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:54.820]   It's because they don't realize that when they die they stand there and go either to
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.820]   hell or to heaven.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.300]   They don't know that.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.300]   They don't realize that.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.140]   They're blind to that.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.460]   They live for the present.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.660]   They don't look to the future.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.980]   They don't know anything about that future, but they don't consider that.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.300]   They can't prove anything about what happens after.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.940]   They say, "I don't believe there's life after death."
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.980]   What's the value of staking all upon your belief?
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.860]   Can you prove that there isn't a life after death?
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.900]   Can you prove there isn't a God and that there isn't a judgment and that there isn't a hell?
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.260]   Of course you can't.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.820]   And I say a man who therefore says, "I don't believe," and therefore there isn't, is a
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:38.180]   fool.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:45.860]   It's when a man begins to awaken to his sinfulness and his vileness, and the fact that he's got
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:53.220]   to die and face God, and that his whole everlasting and eternal future is in the balance, that
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.180]   he begins to pay attention.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.180]   This is the thing.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.740]   It wasn't his great mind.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.940]   It's this thing that's drugging his mind, this evil influence that is paralyzing the
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.940]   mind.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.940]   That's the problem.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.580]   And he's not only blind as to his own state and condition, oh, how tragically blind he
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.620]   is to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.260]   You know there's something to me so terribly tragic about these people.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.700]   I look at them and I see them there, standing and looking into the face of the Son of God
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:33.540]   in all his glory and his beauty and his majesty, and they hate him.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.540]   What was the matter with them?
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:41.060]   Well, though they had eyes, they couldn't see.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.660]   There was a kind of film over their eyes.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:51.860]   They were so under the influence of this poison called sin that he became a monster to them.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.620]   They couldn't see him.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.620]   Everything was distorted.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.500]   The image wasn't there.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:02.060]   And so they're blind to him and all he has to give them and all he's ready to do for
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.060]   them.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:09.780]   Isn't this a terrible state to be in, my friend?
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:16.540]   That you can consider and look at the record of the Son of God come into this world and
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.820]   say there's nothing in it, rubbish, nonsense.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.100]   But that is what sin does.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.500]   That's what the devil does.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.500]   He blinds us.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.900]   We don't see these things.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.060]   We don't see ourselves.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.620]   We don't see him.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:34.460]   We don't realize that he and he alone can save us and that unless we come to him we
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.820]   remain lost.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.820]   They don't see that.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.020]   They're blind to it.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:46.500]   And they have no conception of what he has to give us.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   The apostle Paul talks about the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.220]   The Lord says here, "Ye will not come to me that ye might have life."
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   Life, my dear friend, isn't that the thing that everybody really needs?
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:06.660]   Life, life more abundant, eternal life, his own life, really living.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.660]   They don't see it.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.660]   Why?
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.100]   They say, "What a narrow business, oh how hopeless."
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.980]   It's their blindness.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.860]   It's their inability to see and to appreciate.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:27.580]   But alas, unfortunately, sin and the devil not only blind us by nature, they create a
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.140]   positive antagonism to the truth.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:38.180]   And all this is implicit surely in the word that our Lord uses here, "Ye will not come
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:45.620]   unto me, though I've done these signs and though I've spoken, ye will not come."
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.620]   What's the matter?
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:52.180]   Well, he's suggesting that the trouble is, as I say, down in the realm of the affections
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.180]   and the sensibilities.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:32:01.420]   It isn't purely intellect, it's much more down in this level.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:11.900]   The devil and sin create within us an antagonism to Christ and to his gospel.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:18.220]   As we've already been told in this Gospel of John in chapter 3, this is the condemnation
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.020]   that light has come into the world.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:30.660]   And men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:35.180]   You know, my friend, as I was saying just now, there is no such thing as being neutral
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.300]   to Jesus Christ.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.780]   There is no such thing as being passive.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.220]   We are all either for him or against him.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.560]   We all either love him or hate him.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   And these people, they hated him.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.300]   It wasn't merely that they wouldn't believe in him.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.040]   They positively hated him.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.080]   And later on, they conspired together.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.440]   They took up stones and hurled them at him.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.320]   They conspired with the authorities and got him killed and removed out of the way.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   It was hatred, positive hatred.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:09.540]   You see how foolish is this idea about an intellectual detachment?
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.100]   That's not the trouble.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.540]   It is this deeper thing.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:21.820]   The natural mind, says the apostle Paul to the Romans, is enmity against God.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.060]   Enmity against God is not subject to the law of God.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.060]   Neither indeed can be.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:32.460]   And let's be quite honest and plain about this.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:38.700]   The man who is not a Christian rarely hates Christianity.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.700]   And he hates Christ.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.700]   Why?
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.140]   Well, the reasons are perfectly clear.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.140]   We have all known them.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.900]   We have all experienced them up to a point.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.580]   And here they are.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:59.500]   Why did these people hate the Lord Jesus Christ and his teaching?
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:05.660]   Why does every man and woman who is not a Christian rarely hate him and hate the teaching
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.660]   still?
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.980]   Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:18.660]   It is because the Lord Jesus Christ and his teaching hurts our pride.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.700]   The intellect is not the trouble.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.820]   It's intellectual pride that is the trouble.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.820]   It's pride of intellect that is the essential difficulty, not the intellect itself.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.540]   Well, now, how does it work?
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.540]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   It works like this.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:39.300]   You see, if you come to Jesus Christ, this is what you're really saying.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:50.860]   He said, "Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.700]   into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.700]   He said again, "Except a man be born again, he cannot be saved."
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:05.220]   He cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:10.100]   He tells us that we've got to become as little children.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:15.180]   He tells us that we must be born again, made anew.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.020]   Go right back to the beginning.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:24.260]   He calls upon us to surrender ourselves utterly and absolutely to him in mind and will and
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.700]   in every other respect.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.940]   He says, "Let him deny himself, take up the cross and follow me."
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:35.100]   Now, there's no need to argue about this.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:44.660]   All that to the natural, non-Christian man is nothing but a sheer insult, and he hates
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.660]   it.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.860]   He says, "Look here, what you're virtually saying is this, that all my intellectual understanding
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.500]   and all my ability is useless.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.940]   What you're telling me is this, that though I'm a great philosopher, that I'm no better
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.740]   than the man who can't think at all.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.740]   That's what you're saying.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.740]   You're insulting me.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.340]   You're saying that all my intellectual achievement and understanding is of no value to me.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.220]   Why?" he says, "That's a sheer insult to me."
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:15.780]   And he resents it, and he hates the one who says it.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:21.660]   You see, the gospel of Jesus Christ tells us that however great our minds are, they're
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.860]   never great enough.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:30.620]   That a man by searching cannot find out God, that God is in heaven and we are on earth.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:35.580]   That though we are so marvelous and so wonderful, and we have devised these things and made
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:40.140]   our inventions and searched out and brought so many hidden things to light, and though
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:46.540]   we are twentieth century men, that in the sight of God, why, we are nothing but flies
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.540]   and less.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:56.900]   And that if you put all our minds into one and multiply it by a million, it would still
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:07.420]   be hopelessly inadequate to encompass the mind of God and to understand it.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.860]   But the modern man hates that.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.700]   He's proud of his intellect.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.700]   He's proud of his understanding.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.100]   He's always contrasting himself with previous ages.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.380]   "Of course," he says, "they were unenlightened.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.380]   They lived in the dark.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.620]   They were still in the backwoods."
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   We've arrived!
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.380]   But where have you arrived, my dear friend?
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:29.940]   Am I insulting your intellect when I say that your mind and mine and that of the whole world
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:38.140]   is totally inadequate to comprehend the infinite and the absolute and the eternal?
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.180]   Why should this insult you?
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.060]   Embrace it and begin to think about it.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.420]   We don't even understand ourselves.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.540]   We don't understand our universe.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.820]   How can we possibly understand God?
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.940]   But the modern man, I say, hates the very suggestion and feels that we're insulting
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.540]   him because we say that his mind isn't big enough.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.420]   You know, there's nothing new about this.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.580]   The apostle Paul says that was the main reason why the Greeks didn't believe the gospel
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.900]   nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.700]   He says it was pride of intellect.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:22.740]   God hath made foolish the wisdom of this world, the wisdom of this world that regarded the
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.940]   cross as folly.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:35.180]   But he also feels that it insults him by telling him that all his achievements are of no value.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:41.140]   And now, you see, I'm thinking of the very good, moral, good-living modern man who's
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.500]   not a Christian.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.500]   You know them, don't you?
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.140]   Oh, I'm not talking now about somebody who lives in the gutter.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:39:00.140]   I'm talking about somebody who lives very respectably in the suburbs of life with a
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   detached house in every respect.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   Who's got high ideals and who's out to help humanity and who lives to do good.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:26.620]   Doesn't believe in God, doesn't believe in Christ, never seen himself a sinner.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:32.940]   He hates this gospel and he hates Christ, and I'll tell you why.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:40.540]   It is because Christ comes to him and tells him that all his righteousness is but as filthy
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.540]   rags.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:49.100]   Or to use the language of the apostle Paul, that all his goodness, all his kind deeds,
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:54.980]   all the sacrifices that he makes, let's grant he makes them, yes, all, says Paul, is nothing
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:05.020]   but dung and refuse, putrefying matter.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.540]   It's offensive in the sight of God.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:15.500]   That says the Lord Jesus Christ to the Pharisees, that which is highly esteemed amongst men
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.260]   is abomination in the sight of God.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.740]   And of course, the moment this man hears this, he says, "This is downright insulting.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:29.180]   Your gospel says that I am in the same position as the prostitute and the adulterer and the
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.180]   murderer."
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.300]   And it does say that.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.140]   That's exactly what it says.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.060]   And the modern man says, "No, I can't believe it.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.060]   It's insulting.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.580]   He hates it."
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:49.700]   And when it goes on to tell him that if he lived to be a thousand and more, that all
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:57.380]   his efforts and his strivings will avail him nothing and will never be enough, he hates
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.380]   it still more.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.380]   He will not come.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:06.100]   Why, he says, "It means that I have to humble myself and say that I am a failure and a fool,
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.940]   that my mind is useless and that all my achievements are nil.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.940]   I've got to come like everybody else, the publicans and the sinners and the vile and
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.940]   the refuse."
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.340]   But it does say that.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.580]   And he will not come because he hates it.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:26.260]   It touches his pride.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:32.700]   It touches the pride of all.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:38.660]   And it is entirely contrary to our nature.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:44.100]   And this is why so many hate it.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:49.460]   The reason why people reject the gospel is not their great and brilliant intellectual
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   understanding.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:56.300]   The real reason is moral.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:02.340]   The gospel of Christ condemns what we like and what we love.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:06.020]   It examines us.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.100]   It searches us.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:13.820]   It reveals our sins to us and it condemns them without any hesitation.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.660]   It says they're wrong and that they're evil and that they must be given up.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.780]   It asks us to forsake them, but we love them.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:28.860]   This is the condemnation, that men love darkness.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:33.060]   And you know, I can give you a proof of the extent of their love of their darkness and
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.880]   of their evil life and their evil deeds.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:44.160]   They love it so much that they'll clutch at anything that has a semblance of intellectual
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.480]   argument and position to justify the life of sin that they're living.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.320]   That's why they'll believe anything they read in the newspaper against the gospel.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.720]   It's the conspiracy to justify us in a life of sin.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.320]   It's always moral.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:07.440]   The gospel condemns what we like and it commands what we hate.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.360]   Isn't that true?
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:18.160]   We know very well that to be a Christian means that we must stop doing certain things, and
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.720]   we don't want to stop doing them.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.560]   We know equally well that it means taking up certain things.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.240]   If I'm to be a Christian, I must follow Christ.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.920]   That means I walk in the light, not in darkness.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.000]   That means that I follow a way of holiness, not a way of giving reign to my lusts and
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.520]   passions and feeding my desires.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.520]   And I don't want that.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.400]   I don't like that as a natural man.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:44.960]   I want to do what I like, and I don't want to spend my time following Christ and praying
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:51.760]   and reading the Bible and trying to follow the example of all the saints of the centuries
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.720]   and to live the kind of life that is depicted in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.200]   The natural man doesn't want it.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.640]   He hates it.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:08.880]   And so, you see, the devil not only blinds our minds, he creates within us this antagonism
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:17.360]   to truth, this bitter hatred of morality and chastity and holiness.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:32.880]   And so men hated the Son of God and crucified him, and hated all that he stood for and taught
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.320]   and all that he offered.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:46.040]   My dear friend, I've held the position before you for this reason, as I said at the beginning.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.880]   Can you see what a terrible state to be in is to be in that state of not being a Christian?
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:45:02.320]   Can't you see the enormity of loving darkness and hating light?
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:12.800]   Can't you see the utter folly of being proud of something that gets you nowhere?
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:19.200]   What's the use of being proud of your intellect when it is so obviously failing men in this
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.280]   modern world, and must fail them always where God is concerned?
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.760]   What's the value of being proud of your great mind when you know that it's going to decay
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.440]   and you're going to die and you're going on and you know nothing about what's there
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.800]   and your great brain can't penetrate through the veil?
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.960]   What's the value of being proud of a mind that doesn't help you when you need it most
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.040]   of all?
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:54.160]   Isn't it monstrous and ridiculous to be proud of achievements that in the sight of
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:59.240]   God are nothing but abomination?
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:06.560]   Is there any greater folly, I say, than to be proud of ourselves as we are as nature,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:15.160]   and to refuse the offer of the gospel?
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:23.600]   Is there any blindness comparable to this blindness that fails to recognize the Son
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:33.360]   of God, that fails to believe that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:41.080]   Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life?
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.920]   Is there a greater madness than this, than to go on your way saying, "Nonsense, rubbish,
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   nothing in it, twentieth-century knowledge has exploded it all, I don't like it," and
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.200]   to go on and on and know you're going to die and refuse?
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.880]   Pardon.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:06.440]   To refuse this message that tells you that though you may have committed every sin that
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:15.960]   human nature is guilty of and can ever be guilty of or is ever capable of, that the
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:24.880]   Son of God died for you and that awful guilt, that God might forgive you and forgive you
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:30.920]   freely, that your sins can be blotted out tonight, nay more, that you can be given a
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:37.560]   new life and a new nature, a new start and a new beginning, that God can work this miracle
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:42.880]   in you, that it doesn't matter what you've been, however lacking you are in intellect
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:48.880]   or in morality or in anything else, it doesn't matter at all because a man never makes himself
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.880]   a Christian.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:56.480]   It is God in Christ by the Holy Spirit who makes Christians by this new creation, and
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:01.080]   he puts a new life into us and a new principle.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:06.400]   Is there anything more appalling than to refuse and to reject all that and to have nothing
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.240]   to do with it?
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:17.680]   Is there a greater madness than the madness which leads men and women to hold on to a
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:24.800]   life that is wrong in itself and evil and small in itself for only a few years and to
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:32.640]   reject an offer that gives us everlasting and eternal joy and pleasure and happiness
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:39.800]   and glory in the presence of God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and the just men, the
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:46.840]   spirits of just men made perfect, and all the holy angel?
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:58.280]   My dear friend, don't you see the unspeakable folly of this position?
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:04.160]   If you feel you're dead and lifeless, if you still feel that you see nothing in Christ
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.640]   and in his gospel, well then, I say, realize that it's for the reasons that I've given
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:15.760]   you and cry out unto God to deliver you.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   It is Christ alone who can deliver you out of the clutches of the devil and of sin.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.480]   Cry out unto him.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.480]   Ask him to have pity and to have mercy upon you.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.640]   Say, "I see these things.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.780]   I see them dimly.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.400]   I see them vaguely.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:40.000]   Lord, deliver me out of this appalling state in which they're unreal and I'm not sure of
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   them."
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.920]   I ask you by his Spirit to open your eyes and to enable you to believe and to give you
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:54.120]   the certain knowledge that here in this world you can become a child of God and when you
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:50:02.920]   die, go on to be with him and to enjoy him to all eternity.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   If you but saw this terrible position, you will not come unto me.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.800]   You would be so alarmed you'd cry out at once.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.440]   I say, cry now.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:29.040]   Ere it be too late, realize the cause of your unbelief and apply without tarrying unto him
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:36.080]   who alone can deliver you and set you free.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.480]   And you know the moment you apply to him, he will tell you that in order to set you
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.120]   free he's already died for you.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.680]   His body was broken.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   His blood was shed.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:53.320]   Why, to save, to set you free, to deliver you, go to him and he'll smile upon you.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.920]   But you say, "I've been a terrible sinner."
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.200]   He'll say, "I died for sinners.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.520]   I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:07.440]   They that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick, go to him.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.480]   Your sin is the greatest claim upon his love.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:20.040]   Go to him as you are and I assure you in his blessed name he will receive you this evening
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:26.320]   and set you free."
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.240]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
