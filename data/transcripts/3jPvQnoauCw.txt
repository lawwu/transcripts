[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   For over a decade, I've racked up over 10 million points
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.800]   and taken so many vacations with those points
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.120]   that I couldn't imagine ever wanting to switch
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.440]   to a cashback strategy.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.240]   However, three big things have changed recently
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.400]   that are making me rethink my whole credit card strategy.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.160]   Have I been doing it wrong the entire time?
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   You don't actually even need to have a points balance
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.680]   right now to take advantage of the arbitrage
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.840]   you can get booking a flight with points.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.000]   The purpose of this episode is to make a steel man case
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.040]   for cashback.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.240]   I really wanted to figure out
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.880]   if cashback was a better deal.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.440]   So I went back to the card optimizer spreadsheet tool
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.600]   I built last year
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.920]   and I completely rebuilt it from the ground up.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.640]   So spending money just like that
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   would get you an effective 37.5% cashback on your spend.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.000]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.800]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.880]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am a huge fan of points, miles,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.480]   and all the amazing travel you can do with them.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.960]   In fact, there are plenty of episodes on this show
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.080]   to help you do just that.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.800]   But a few things have been happening lately
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.440]   that make me considering whether I might be better off
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.800]   just focusing on cashback.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.840]   For long-time listeners,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.000]   that might sound crazy coming from me, but hear me out
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.640]   and make sure you listen through to the end
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.600]   because there might actually be a third option
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.800]   that's even better.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.360]   But no matter what strategy you want,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   I am confident this episode
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.680]   will help you dial in your setup even more.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.960]   And I will also be giving you a little preview
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.720]   of an updated tool I built
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.840]   to help anyone optimize their credit card strategy.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.400]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.560]   Okay, for a little history, I love credit card points,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.960]   especially with a kind that are transferable
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.000]   to different airline and hotel groups
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.440]   because you get so much more flexibility,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.520]   and it usually results in a much higher ROI.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.360]   And also, there is something amazing
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.600]   about travel feeling free.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.120]   There's just less guilt than when you spend money.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.400]   And if I just think about a specific example,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.240]   spending 150,000 points
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.200]   on an international business class flight
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   is nowhere near as hard as spending 1,500 to $2,000 might be.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.160]   Also, it forces a type of luxury
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.760]   I'm not sure I would otherwise treat myself to,
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.160]   which maybe that's a good thing, maybe it's a bad thing.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.400]   I'll let you decide.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.840]   So for over a decade, I've racked up over 10 million points
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   and taken so many vacations with those points
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.120]   that I couldn't imagine ever wanting to switch
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.000]   to a cashback strategy.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.440]   However, three big things have changed recently
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.320]   that are making me rethink my whole credit card strategy.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.040]   First, I look deeper at a few cards,
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760]   notably the Bank of America Premium Rewards Card,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.680]   the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.080]   and the new Robinhood card
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.800]   that is gonna offer 3% cash back on everything.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.680]   Though just to be clear,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.760]   there are some skeptics of how long that will work for.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   However, right now, it is a 3% on everything card.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.440]   The second thing is that I've been watching
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.520]   a bunch of points get devalued.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.640]   So if you're sitting on Turkish Air points,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.760]   they're probably feeling a lot less valuable,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.520]   that happened to Alaska, it happens all the time.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.160]   But when I look at the cash in my Wealthfront Cash account,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.280]   it's going up by over 5% every year.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.520]   So I've been reflecting on points getting less valuable
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.200]   and cash getting more valuable,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.240]   and the fact that I haven't spent as many points
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.520]   as I've accumulated in the last few years,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.920]   so that's been a big point.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.200]   And then number three is a big one.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.480]   I watched some points go on sale this year,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.160]   and I realized there are a lot of different ways
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.240]   that you can get points
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.880]   than just by earning them on a credit card.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.120]   For one, many airlines and hotel groups
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.680]   constantly have sales on points.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   For example, of my 12 favorite transfer partners
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.280]   from my credit cards,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.120]   points go on sale for as low as 1.15 to 1.2 cents,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.320]   and that's on Life Miles or Aeroplan,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.200]   and on average across all the partners that sell points,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.120]   they go on sale for about 1.5 cents per point.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.280]   And depending on the partner,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.200]   they go on sale as often as every one to three months.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.600]   And then there's some points
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.560]   that I don't actually even like transferring to,
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.600]   though I do think they have good value,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.880]   that go on sale for as little as half a cent a point,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.480]   like Hilton or close to that for Choice Hotels and Marriott.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.760]   So I just wanna bring an example here.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.440]   I was looking at this United flight
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.880]   from New York to Geneva in business class,
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.920]   and it was about $5,000 if you paid cash,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.840]   but it was only 63,000 miles with Avianca's Life Miles.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.120]   Now, I assume very few people listening
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.840]   have a Life Miles balance,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.640]   but you can transfer Amex, Citi, Cap One,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.240]   Built, and Wells Fargo points to Life Miles,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.680]   which means most of you listening
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.080]   actually do have access to Life Miles
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.280]   and could get almost eight cents per point with that flight.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.880]   However, you could also just go buy 63,000 Life Miles
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.160]   right now while they're having a sale,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.840]   which by the way, they did 13 different times last year,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.000]   and those miles would be $825.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.160]   So you don't actually even need
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.840]   to have a points balance right now
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.640]   to take advantage of the arbitrage
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.160]   you can get booking a flight with points.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.880]   In fact, in this example,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.640]   transferring 63,000 points to Life Miles
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.120]   when you could otherwise buy them for $825
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.240]   means you're only getting 1.3 cents of value,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.400]   which is nothing like the eight cents
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.640]   you might be thinking when you go through this process.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.920]   So to go one step deeper on this example,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.000]   let's assume you earned those 63,000 points
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.800]   on a 2X points card after you spent $31,500.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.120]   Well, to get the $825 you'd need
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.280]   to buy those same number of points
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.520]   with the same $31,500 of spend on a cash back card,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.240]   you'd need to be earning at least 2.62%,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.080]   which is really actually a funny number
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.480]   because it is almost the exact percent cash back
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.240]   you can get on all purchases
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.760]   with the Bank of America Premium Rewards card,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.240]   assuming you have $100,000
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.880]   at a Bank of America or Merrill Lynch account.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.120]   And if you had the 3% card with Robinhood,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.600]   you'd earn even more on that amount of spend
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.800]   or you would need less spend to earn $825 of cash back.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.880]   But don't jump to conclusions.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.560]   I am not done with this episode
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.680]   and I'm gonna go a lot deeper on all of this
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.360]   and I might actually change your opinion
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.520]   a few times before I'm done.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.000]   However, I was talking about buying airline
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   and hotel points for less than one and a half cents,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.960]   but having points in an airline or a hotel chain
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.920]   isn't necessarily as flexible
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.720]   as having them in Chase or Amex
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.120]   or somewhere where you can transfer them
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.880]   to lots of different partners.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.280]   In fact, if you look at the value people give to Chase
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   or Amex or BuiltPoints on the internet,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   you'll find that that value is actually higher
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.680]   than the value of any of the points
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.520]   you can transfer to individually.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.840]   And that is because there is an inherent value
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.640]   in having that flexibility.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.480]   Knowing that if one program devalues,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.640]   you still have the access to all the other programs.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.680]   However, Chase, Amex, Citi,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.840]   none of these programs ever sell their points.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.080]   But the more I thought about buying points,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.000]   the more I wondered how much would it cost
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.600]   to buy them in another way, to effectively buy them.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.800]   And I realized for anywhere from half a cent
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.320]   to one and a half cents,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.640]   using your credit card to do things like pay taxes,
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.800]   buy gift cards, especially if you have to save for college
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.280]   or pay off student loans,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.440]   or even just pay bills or send money to friends online
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   when you have to cover the 2.9% fee.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.320]   And I'm gonna do a whole episode on earning more points
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.640]   without needing to increase your spending soon
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.000]   where we'll go really deep on those
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.880]   and so many more options.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.000]   But for that last example,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.480]   if you were to pay a 2.9% credit card fee
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.560]   to be able to send $10,000 to a friend
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.840]   or pay a $10,000 property tax bill
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.440]   and put it on your card,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.240]   and let's assume you're putting it on a card
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.920]   like the Venture X that earns two points per dollar,
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.760]   you would get 20,000 points for that $10,000 spend
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.720]   and you would pay a $290 fee.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.800]   So that means you'd be getting 20,000 points for $290
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.680]   or paying 1.45 cents per point.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.360]   Now, if you aren't able to get more than 1.45 cents in value
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.920]   for each one of your points,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.480]   I wouldn't suggest doing this
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.480]   because cashing out those flexible points
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.840]   usually only gets you about one cent per point
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.120]   or $200 back, which is definitely less
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.160]   than the 290 you spent to get them.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.440]   While that is more work
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.840]   than just earning and having those points,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.400]   it also means that even if you can regularly find ways
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.800]   to get two or even 10 cents of value,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.240]   booking, business class travel,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.440]   staying at luxury properties,
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.040]   you probably shouldn't use those points values
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.760]   when you're comparing the points values
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.040]   you earned on credit cards with cash back
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.080]   because you can always find ways
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.400]   to effectively buy those same points,
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.920]   whether it's buying through airline and hotel programs
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.160]   when they go on sale
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.960]   or using kind of methods like I just mentioned
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.600]   to buy flexible points.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.120]   And then you can actually get that same
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   two to 10 cents of value.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.800]   So this was a really big change
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.960]   in the way I thought about things
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.360]   because the reason I loved credit card points in miles
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.400]   was that they let you take travel
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.480]   that would otherwise be much more expensive
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.440]   and get access to it for much less,
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.880]   but it's not actually earning the points in miles
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.960]   that makes it the better deal,
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.520]   it's actually just having them.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.440]   So if you could go out any time of day
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.120]   and just buy chase points for one cent per dollar,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.800]   which you can't, but if you could,
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.600]   I wouldn't need to earn chase points at all
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.560]   'cause I would just buy them
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.520]   right before I was about to book a flight.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   And if for some reason I wanted to take a trip
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.560]   and the points weren't an option,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.160]   then I wouldn't buy the points and I would have to pay cash.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.280]   So for the sake of comparing and valuing points to cash back,
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.280]   it really depends on how many of these different methods
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.880]   you could use to get points
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.080]   and the scale of the points you need.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.920]   For example, if you have to make lots of tax payments
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.200]   each year where the fee to pay with your credit card
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.400]   is only 1.82%,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.880]   which means you can actually effectively buy points
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.160]   for less than one cent,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.960]   well, if that's you and you pay lots of tax payments
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.480]   and you're actively saving for kids' colleges
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.080]   or paying off student loans
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.200]   and you only think you really need 100,000 points a year,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.920]   then yeah, maybe you probably don't need to value them
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.280]   at much more than one cent,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.040]   in which case cash back might end up being a better strategy
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.440]   and we'll get there.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   But if those things aren't true,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.880]   maybe the amount you should be valuing points at
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.080]   is probably closer to 1.5 cents
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.240]   or if you're spending millions and millions of dollars a year
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.200]   on a credit card and you're trying to rack up
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.800]   just a massive amount of points
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.880]   that you could never get in other ways,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.000]   then maybe none of these tactics to buy points
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.120]   will work for you
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.960]   and you really need to pick something closer
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.440]   to the value you redeem them at.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.040]   So maybe that's two or three cents a point.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.360]   For the sake of this episode,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.920]   I'll probably use a number about 1.5 cents
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.640]   'cause it's kind of right in the middle.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.280]   So in short, there is no debating
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.360]   that booking some flights and hotels,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   especially when you're traveling internationally
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.320]   or when you wanna stay at these aspirational vacations
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.080]   or fly in these aspirational premium cabins,
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.520]   doing that with points and miles
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.960]   will give you an incredible deal over booking with cash,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.760]   assuming you're flexible enough to find the right inventory.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.920]   But I want to explore whether it's a better deal
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.080]   to focus on earning cash back
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.760]   and buying those points when you find the right deals
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.200]   and if you never do,
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.960]   then you already have the money to buy those flights in cash.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.200]   That's what I wanna compare.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.080]   So the purpose of this episode
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.200]   is to make a steel man case for cash back,
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.720]   which just to be clear,
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.760]   doesn't necessarily mean as I'm making it
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.920]   that it's 100% my stance.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.960]   I kind of feel like I'm in a debate club here,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.400]   though I might actually end up convincing myself
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.480]   by the end of this,
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.880]   but I will make sure to include my perspective
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.100]   before we're done.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.260]   So let's start with the basics.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.020]   Just like points, cash back is tax-free,
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.660]   it's considered a rebate,
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.920]   so you don't have to worry about that.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.100]   A great pro to cash back,
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.220]   you can invest all the cash back you get
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.820]   and earn 5% or more per year.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.320]   It is totally flexible.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.540]   You can use it to buy points,
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.140]   you can use it to pay for anything,
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.380]   you have ultimate flexibility and liquidity
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.580]   when you get cash,
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.980]   including, like I said, buying points.
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.540]   And there is no stress about not being able
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.740]   to find a good deal with points and miles on your vacation
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.580]   because you don't have a massive balance of points.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.060]   It also means you don't need to keep paying annual fees
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.880]   on cards just to keep your points balance alive.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.620]   So a lot of reasons to like cash back.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.380]   Let me run through a few of the cash back cards.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.340]   Actually, before we run through all the cards,
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.060]   there are timestamps in the show notes.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.720]   So if you wanna jump ahead
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.300]   to go to the meat of the discussion
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.340]   and then come back later and listen to the rundown
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.160]   of the best cards in each categories,
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.140]   feel free to jump around.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.740]   We always put those timestamps there
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.000]   to make it easy to find different chapters
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.260]   or sections of the conversation.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.220]   For just general overall spend,
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.340]   right now, I can't think of any better card
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.060]   than the Robinhood card that's coming out.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.740]   It's 3% on everything.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.260]   I don't have it yet.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.100]   According to Robinhood, if you use my link,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.340]   which is allthehacks.com/robinhood,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.140]   I will move up the wait list.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.340]   It's not an affiliate link or a sponsor link
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.300]   or anything like that.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.440]   It's just my referral link.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.980]   So that right now seems to be the leader
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.160]   for overall everything spend.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.860]   The leader before that
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.580]   was the Bank of America Premium Rewards card,
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.620]   which got you 2.625% on everything.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.160]   And that is because they have this weird program
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.660]   where you earn 1.5 points that are all worth one cent.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.260]   But if you have diamond or platinum honor status
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.100]   with Bank of America,
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.740]   which you get by having $100,000
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.340]   in a Bank of America or a Merrill Lynch account,
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.140]   and that doesn't even have to be managed by them.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.440]   It can be self-managed.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.920]   Then you get 1.75 times the number of awards,
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.500]   which is where you get to that 2.625% number.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.760]   So that's previously been the best card.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.120]   There are also a couple of cards that for your first year,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.020]   you can earn 3% that Discover has a card.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.840]   The Chase Freedom Unlimited had a promo
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.820]   where you normally get 1.5%,
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.980]   but at the end of the year, they would match it.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.780]   And supposedly that went away,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.460]   but the link we have in the show notes
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.860]   seems to still show it at least as the time of recording.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.940]   So those are kind of the best everything cards.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.360]   The next set is cards that give you higher cash back,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.240]   but only on one or two categories.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.140]   And depending on the card,
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.520]   you might have to pick the category in advance
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.680]   or it's your top spend category.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.880]   And depending on the card,
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.080]   some of them are capped at $500 a month,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.080]   some of them at 2,000 or 2,500 a quarter.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.000]   But some of those are the US Bank Cash Plus card,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.480]   the Bank of America Customized Cash card,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.760]   the Citi Custom Cash card.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.880]   Those are a few.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.680]   And you basically get to either pick
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.060]   or spend in a category could be a 5% cash back
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.780]   on gas station card or restaurants or grocery stores,
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.140]   whichever one, but that spend is usually capped
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   at somewhere on the order of six to $10,000 a year of spend.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.500]   So if you spend $25,000 a year on groceries,
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.860]   you can't really call it a 5% grocery card
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.340]   'cause you're only getting that premium return
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.820]   on the first $10,000 or maybe 6,000, depending on the card.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.020]   There's two cards, the Discover It and Freedom Flex
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.480]   that do a 5% on rotating categories each quarter.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.500]   So if you happen to line up the category
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.940]   with where you're spending, it can be good,
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.740]   but you don't know in advance what those categories are.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.980]   Then if I run through different categories,
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.620]   there's some really interesting cards.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.540]   So the Amazon card, it's the Amazon Prime card
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.140]   if you're an Amazon Prime holder,
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.780]   it gets you 5% back on Amazon and Whole Foods.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.500]   Next is the US Bank Altitude Reserve card.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.460]   And it gives you three X points, which are worth one cent.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.020]   So 3% cash back on travel spend and on mobile wallet,
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.620]   meaning Apple Pay, Google Pay, all of that.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.980]   I've been told that it also works
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.540]   if you use Apple Pay in the browser,
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.460]   but not Google Pay in the browser.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.420]   So, but 3% back on Apple Pay is something I have never seen
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.980]   and didn't realize was there until a few months ago
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.140]   as I started digging into this topic.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.500]   But US Bank has this program called Realtime Rewards.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.820]   And how that works is if you spend money on your card
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.100]   in the travel category, that could be an Uber,
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.300]   it could be buying a ticket, they send you a message
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.780]   and say, "Hey, if you wanna redeem your points right now,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.100]   "we'll give you one and a half times the value."
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.460]   So that means that assuming that you spend enough travel
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.380]   on the card such that you can use your points
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.100]   to cancel out that travel,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.380]   which is different than a Chase bonus
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.420]   where you have to spend those points in the portal
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.220]   and book in the portal, US Bank also does that.
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.900]   But you can just book the travel
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.780]   and they'll let you credit it off your statement.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.040]   So that makes mobile wallet and travel spending
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.320]   four and a half percent cash back,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.340]   which is really, really amazing.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.900]   I've actually heard people booking travel,
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.740]   redeeming the points to credit it off
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.260]   and then canceling it if it's a refundable airfare
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.620]   and then still being able to keep the points.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.800]   But I don't think it would be that hard to make sure
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.540]   that however much you spend on the card,
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.900]   you put four and a half percent of your spending
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.260]   into the travel category.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.300]   If you're listening to this show,
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.540]   you're probably someone that spends
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.980]   at least that much on travel.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.660]   Now in the dining category, there are so many options.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.860]   So I'll run through them quickly.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.500]   The Capital One Saver is 4% on dining.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.660]   The US Bank Altitude Go is 4% on dining.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.120]   But now I'm gonna mention one
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.980]   that doesn't seem like a cash back card,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.520]   which is the Amex Gold.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.140]   And Amex Gold is 4X points on dining.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.600]   And I wouldn't think of it as a cash back card,
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.660]   but you can cash out Amex points in lots of different ways
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.900]   that give you at least one cent of value.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.780]   Some gift cards, booking travel in the portal,
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.020]   including, I've heard of booking things
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.860]   that are refundable and canceling them.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.660]   You just get cash back instead of your points back.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.380]   But even better, if you have the Schwab Platinum Card,
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.980]   you can actually take all of your Amex point balance
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.460]   and transfer it to a Schwab brokerage account
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.700]   and get 1.1 cents for all your points.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.980]   So if you had the Schwab Platinum Card and the Amex Gold,
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.240]   you'd effectively be getting 4.4% cash back on all dining.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.700]   There's a lot of other cards
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.020]   in the three and a half, 3% and down range,
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.940]   but that's a little overview.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.740]   In the travel camp, on flights, again, the Amex Platinum,
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.740]   that Schwab Platinum, also 5X points.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.740]   Or if you cash out to Schwab, 5.5% cash back.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.260]   So I could think of the Amex Platinum
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.700]   as a 5% cash back card,
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.520]   or Schwab Platinum as a 5.5% cash back card.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.460]   The new Wells Fargo Autograph Journey Card
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.020]   is 5% on hotels back and 4% back on airfare.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.440]   The Altitude Reserve, like I said,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.100]   four and a half percent back on travel.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.020]   This Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.140]   depending on whether you value the points
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.900]   at statement credit value,
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.120]   which is 3X points would be worth 3% cash back,
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.060]   or if booking in the travel portal
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.860]   means that you feel like you can consider those cash back
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.180]   because you could just buy a flight
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.100]   and you don't need to transfer it to airlines
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.300]   and find availability,
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.620]   then the Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.580]   is also four and a half percent back on travel
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.460]   and rewinding four and a half percent back on dining,
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.500]   because the Chase Sapphire Reserve card
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.020]   gives you points worth one and a half cents
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.780]   in the Chase travel portal.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.540]   So three times one and a half,
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.140]   that's where I get the four and a half percent.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.180]   Gas, I did a little bit of research.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.220]   It seems like the best card
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.360]   is the Abound Credit Union Visa card,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.860]   which has 5% back on gas with no cap,
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.120]   because we have electric vehicles,
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.460]   not a category I've spent a lot of time on.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.500]   Groceries, big category for lots of people.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   The Amex Blue Cash Preferred, 6% back on $6,000 a year.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.240]   The Verizon card, which only works
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   if you're a Verizon customer, is 4% back on groceries.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.040]   Then there is a AAA card that gives you 5% back
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.700]   up to $10,000 a year.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.260]   And then, like I mentioned earlier,
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.180]   the Amex Gold, up to $25,000 of spend on groceries.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.280]   You get 4% back, or 4X points that you can convert
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.400]   for one cent, or with that Schwab Platinum,
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.120]   it's like four and a half, 4.4% back.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.760]   Last, in the kind of internet cable phone bill category,
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.720]   the Ink Cash is 5% back there,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.680]   and then there's a BMO Cash Back card that's also 5%.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.700]   Now that I calculated all the best Cash Back cards,
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.920]   I really wanted to figure out
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.880]   if Cash Back was a better deal.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.480]   So I went back to the Card Optimizer Spreadsheet tool
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   I built last year, and I completely rebuilt it
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.520]   from the ground up.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.740]   I probably spent 40 hours or more on it
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.840]   and added so much functionality.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.260]   So for those that don't have it already,
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.500]   here's how it works.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.820]   You add roughly, or exactly, however much you spend
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.620]   in a bunch of different categories,
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.900]   and you check off all the cards you have,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.100]   I think I loaded 42 in the system,
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.940]   and it will tell you the return you're getting
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.860]   on your spend, net of all the annual fees,
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.220]   but more importantly, it'll let you simulate
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.460]   what things would look like if you add or subtract cards,
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.560]   so you can find the best combo of cards
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.180]   for your spending pattern.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.860]   And with the upgraded version, it does a lot more.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.060]   Most importantly, it'll let you set a specific goal
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.940]   of whether you wanna earn points, Cash Back,
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.980]   or whatever maximizes your return
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.500]   based on how you value points.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.700]   Then I added a bunch of the Cash Back cards,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.060]   like I mentioned above, including adding spending caps
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.760]   and the ability to pick which categories you want.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.620]   So if you pick the City Custom Cash,
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.780]   you can say, "Give me my 5% back on gas or groceries."
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.140]   And when it tells you which card to use for a category,
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.980]   it will tell you a backup if you spend more
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.820]   than the cap allows.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.200]   I also added in some toggles,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.900]   so if you choose a Bank of America card,
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.540]   it'll ask you what status you have or things like that.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.880]   And finally, it shows you which card to use
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.980]   for every single category,
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.020]   and tells you how much you'll be spending
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.000]   on each individual card.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.980]   So if you wanna follow along,
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.860]   you can access that tool as well.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.900]   It's live on the site right now
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.800]   at allthehacks.com/cardtool.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.120]   As for the impact this tool can have,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.040]   I'll just give you my personal experience,
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.140]   because after all, I built the tool I wanted to use,
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.140]   and when I plugged in my own spending and my own cards
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.020]   and looked at the gaps I had,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.660]   I found that by tweaking my spending
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.240]   and adding just one card to my lineup,
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.260]   I'd earn an extra $500 per year,
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.820]   and a second card would bring that up to $800 a year,
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.980]   which at least for me is a meaningful amount of money
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.940]   worth doing something.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.820]   So like I said, you can get the tool today.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.400]   There's a full video walkthrough on the website.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.780]   It's $48, but until May 10th,
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.580]   you can use the code LAUNCH for $10 off.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.180]   However, if you already bought the first version
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.420]   of the Optimizer tool,
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.460]   check your email,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.180]   because you'll have a special coupon code
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.220]   that adds $10 off to however much you paid
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.420]   for the first version.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.740]   So if you paid $10, your new code will be for $20 off,
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.580]   and everyone that paid more than $38 for the first version
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.780]   will have a coupon code to make it free.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.820]   Or even better, if you're already an AllTheHacks member,
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.540]   you can get the tool completely free on the member site,
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.840]   or if you wanna join and get the member tool for free,
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.500]   you can do that at allthehacks.com/join.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.340]   And as a member,
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.620]   you'll also get to join our monthly member calls
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.300]   and get access to all our member exclusive deals,
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.660]   like a free year of Kubera,
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.780]   50% off Trust and Will, and a lot more.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.220]   So two different ways to get access.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.940]   And I really wanna know what you think.
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.620]   I spent so much time and energy building this tool,
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.420]   and it's been super valuable to me.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.020]   I hope it's valuable to you.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.300]   Of course, you can find the link in the show notes again.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.820]   It's allthehacks.com/cardtool.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.580]   And so after building it, I decided to use it,
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.700]   both with the Bureau and Labor Statistics data
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.940]   for a family in the top 10% of spending,
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.100]   which turns out is about $90,000 a year, and for myself.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.220]   And here's what I learned.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.620]   For most people, you actually get 90% of the value
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.180]   with just four cards.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.460]   I know that sounds crazy.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.080]   A lot of us, myself included, have more,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.580]   but for the purpose of this comparison,
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.100]   I'm just gonna focus on four card combos.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.220]   However, thinking about card combos gave me an idea
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.180]   to actually do an episode running through each issuer,
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.420]   so Chase, Amex, Citi, and talking about the best cards
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.140]   and the best card combos within each.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.140]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.660]   Obviously, your spending patterns
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.260]   might change the calculus.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.800]   Fortunately, you could use the tool
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.340]   and go in and put whatever spend in cards you want
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.780]   and get an even more granular version
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.360]   of what I'm about to share.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.860]   So four team points.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.040]   The four cards were the Amex Gold, the Amex Platinum,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.880]   the Sapphire Reserve from Chase,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.640]   and the Capital One Venture X.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.820]   And for team cashback, we've got the Amex Gold,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.600]   the Schwab Platinum, the Altitude Reserve,
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.800]   and the Robin Hood card.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   Like I mentioned earlier,
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.720]   if you're thinking Amex Gold is a points card,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.400]   that's not a cashback card.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.360]   Yes, but you can redeem those points for cashback.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.480]   If you pair it with the Schwab,
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   that makes it a 4.4% dining and grocery card.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.120]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.800]   It also means flights is a 5.5% back.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.240]   Now, I get it.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.700]   Maybe you're on team cashback
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.840]   and you don't want the hassle
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   of converting points back into dollars.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   So I'll give you a couple backups there.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.120]   On the travel side, you could just do the Altitude Reserve,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.280]   which is 4.5% cashback.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.320]   On the dining and grocery side,
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.200]   I would say your best bet is probably either
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.720]   the Verizon card for 4% back on groceries
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.760]   or the Capital One Saver for 4% on dining
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.100]   and 3% on groceries.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.120]   Those are a couple of good options as a fallback
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.680]   if you don't wanna assume that you can convert
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.380]   Amex points to cash through the Schwab Platinum card.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.800]   So those are the main cards.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   Here's the analysis.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.620]   If I ran about $80,000 of spending,
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.620]   then team cashback is at $2,965 of cashback,
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:38.000]   and the points would have been 210,652 points.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.040]   So effectively, that trade-off means you're buying points
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.640]   for 1.41 cents.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.680]   And for the sake of the example,
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.760]   I'll just round 2,965 to 3,000,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.320]   210,652 to 210,000.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.680]   And when actually, when I went in with my own data,
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.280]   which was a lot higher spend
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.200]   in a lot of different categories,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.940]   it was about the same at 1.45 cents per point.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.960]   So you could argue right here
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.380]   that if you value transferable points at 1 1/2 cents,
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.300]   then you're still getting a better deal,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.580]   but I wanted to dig in a little more.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.780]   You could argue that if you value transferable points
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.820]   at 1 1/2 cents,
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.920]   then you're getting a better deal with the points,
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.620]   but I also wanted to look at the opportunity cost
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.400]   of if you chose one path and wanted the other.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.780]   So let's say you went with cashback
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.220]   and you decided you later wanted points.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.860]   Worst case, if you took out that $3,000 that you saved
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.580]   and you used it to pay a 2.9% fee
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.560]   to send money or pay bills,
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.420]   you'd be able to cover $103,000 of spend.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.680]   So let's assume you put it all on a 2X card
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.980]   like the Venture X,
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.020]   you would end up with 206,000 points,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.820]   which is just 4,000 points less than you would have had
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.660]   if you had gone for points from the start.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.860]   However, a few notes.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.780]   Like I said before,
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.100]   if you have less expensive ways to buy points,
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.420]   like let's say you're always making
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.420]   estimated payments on taxes,
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.280]   or you are finding deals on flights
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.740]   where you can buy points like you could Life Miles points
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.180]   for 1.2 cents,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.700]   then you would actually end up with way more points.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.300]   And also, if you don't need the points right away,
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.700]   you could be investing all your cash back,
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.560]   getting a 5% return,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.660]   which in less than a year would grow to enough cash
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.980]   that you would end up with more points as well.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.920]   However, I don't know anyone
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.740]   who has a $100,000 limit on their card.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.740]   So actually turning $3,000 into over 200,000 points
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.560]   would take some time and some effort,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.720]   but you would get back to about the same place
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.220]   if you had gotten points in the first place.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.360]   So let's reverse that.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.660]   What if you earned points and then later wanted cash back?
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.740]   Well, that 210,000 points,
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.760]   I looked at each one of the different types of points
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.500]   you would have earned and the best ways to cash it out,
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.020]   even if you're perfectly optimal,
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.820]   meaning you have the Schwab Platinum,
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.420]   you get 1.1 cents per Amex point,
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.980]   you consider booking travel in the Chase Portal
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.020]   as a way to cash out,
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.940]   so you get one and a half cents there,
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.020]   you end up at $2,300 in cash.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.500]   So while transferring your $3,000 cash back
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.460]   gets you about the same number of points,
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.500]   transferring your points
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.380]   gets you about $700 less in cash back.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.000]   So you're down about 25%.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.780]   My immediate reaction to all of this was a bit of shock.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.740]   Have I been doing it wrong the entire time?
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.380]   But it's not all or nothing.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.420]   So I thought, what if I ran through
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.880]   what I was actually putting on these cards?
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.940]   So for dining, grocery, and flights,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.260]   those were on the Amex Gold and the Amex Platinum.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.780]   So that's what I'm already doing.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.740]   So I guess, no, I'm not doing it wrong.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.560]   If I actually just wanted the cash back,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.900]   I could just cash out all those Amex points
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.380]   and I'd probably open up the Schwab Platinum
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.020]   so I could cash them out at one and a half cents.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.620]   So if I wanted cash back for my Amex points
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.620]   in those categories, I'm doing a good job.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.180]   Then on the rest of travel, in the points world,
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.840]   I would be building up a balance with a Chase Reserve card.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.960]   And if I felt like booking in the portal was reasonable,
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.880]   then I would actually get about 4.5% cash back,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.100]   which is the same as the Altitude Reserve.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.320]   So, okay, travel category,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.440]   what I would be doing for cash back or team points,
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.480]   it doesn't matter, it's all about the same.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.620]   So no real issues there.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.300]   And then let's move to the next one,
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.140]   which was a big category of spend for us, which was Amazon.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.700]   The best points card for Amazon
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.620]   without going down the rabbit hole of cards
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.340]   with spending caps is a 2X card like the Venture X,
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.620]   but the Amazon Prime card is 5% back.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.720]   So if you're earning points like this,
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.980]   you are effectively paying two and a half cents
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.700]   for each of them, which is definitely not a good deal.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.340]   However, it turns out I've actually already
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.900]   evaluated this specific one in isolation before.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.860]   And so I actually use my Amazon card
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.940]   for all Amazon and Whole Foods purchases,
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.500]   and I do not earn points there.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.740]   I did dabble a little while ago in buying Amazon
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.920]   and Whole Foods gift cards at a grocery store,
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.020]   getting 4X points, which would probably push
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.580]   the balances here towards points a little bit,
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.200]   depending on how you value them.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.620]   But I will just say that it felt like a little bit
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.220]   of a hassle and I was trying to both optimize,
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.380]   but not over optimize, because at the end of the day,
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.260]   time is also really valuable.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.820]   And that's one thing that I'm trying to control.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.940]   So now let's talk about another big category, mobile wallet.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.820]   And this is where I'm probably doing things all wrong.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.060]   By using a 2X card, every time I go to Costco,
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.900]   instead of the altitude reserve,
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.420]   where I could be getting four and a half percent back,
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.820]   I'm effectively paying 2.25 cents per point,
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.820]   which is not a good deal, right?
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.420]   We've already established that there's probably easy ways
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.640]   to buy points for anywhere from like one
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.100]   to one and a half cents.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.260]   So paying 2.25 seems crazy.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.020]   And honestly, this is where I think I need
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.260]   to make a change going forward.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.180]   And then finally, it's the everything else category,
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.100]   which is a really big category for me
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.780]   and feels like a place where I've been getting
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.260]   two and a half points,
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.060]   where I could now be getting 3% back.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.620]   And fortunately for a moment, I was like,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.620]   gosh, if I've been doing it wrong here too,
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.340]   and then I realized no, this 3% back card only just came out,
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.260]   I don't even have access to it yet.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.120]   So maybe I'm about to be doing things wrong,
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.500]   but I can't look at it in the past.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.060]   But it effectively means that by using a VentureX
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.500]   instead of a Robinhood card,
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.780]   I'm paying one and a half cents per point.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.020]   Now, this one's right on the edge,
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.140]   because yeah, you could maybe find a way to get points
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.000]   for a little bit cheaper than that.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.440]   However, it would be a lot of hassle.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.500]   Now, if you assume we're not using the Robinhood card,
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   'cause it's not out yet, or at least not for me,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.300]   and you look at the Bank of America premium rewards,
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.980]   that 2.625% versus 2X is like buying points
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.700]   at 1.31 cents per point, which I'm actually fine doing.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.380]   So this cash back category, it's a little bit of a mixed bag
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.260]   and I'll give you my opinion in a second.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.180]   But my big takeaway is that doing the best option
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.740]   that maximizes your return on a category basis
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.660]   and gives you some flexibility is amazing.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.880]   So the fact that using the Amex Gold and the Amex Platinum
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.580]   for flights and dining and groceries
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.740]   is the best for both worlds,
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.340]   but I have points that I could cash back,
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.020]   knowing that if I cash them out,
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.820]   I'd be getting just as good a value
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.180]   of using cash back from the start, makes me feel good.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.500]   But I probably need to start tracking
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.220]   how many of my everything else purchases
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.820]   could be on Apple Pay,
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.280]   because getting four and a half percent back
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.620]   through the Altitude Reserve
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.920]   seems like a pretty meaningful option.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.120]   And knowing that the browser might count,
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.840]   I'm gonna start paying attention there.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.080]   I'm actually probably gonna go in and look into Copilot,
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.180]   which is the budgeting app I love,
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.380]   and look how many of the categories of things
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.140]   that are in that everything else category,
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.240]   I could have used Apple Pay.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.140]   Obviously, if you love Copilot,
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.420]   you can get a two month free trial,
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.100]   just use the promo code HACKS2.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.780]   And that's a number two.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.900]   As for the Robinhood card,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:10.400]   I think what I'm going to do is actually get the card.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.220]   It seems so crazy counter to the last 20 years of my life,
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.460]   but in the spirit of experimentation, which I love to do,
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.900]   I think I'm gonna get it
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.900]   and just see what it feels like to earn cash back.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.740]   Maybe the first time I swiped the card,
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.080]   my gut just can't handle it.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.320]   And I put it back in my wallet
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.480]   and I start paying with the Venture X again,
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.380]   but I could be wrong.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.640]   Maybe I'll give myself a month of what that felt like.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.880]   How do I feel?
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.280]   I honestly don't know.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.760]   I'll share about how that experience goes.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.120]   If you wanna try the same,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.640]   allthehacks.com/robinhood is my referral link
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.440]   because I cannot start this experiment
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.700]   until I get the card.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.000]   In fact, this is probably a good time to remind you,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.640]   if you're getting any card
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.400]   and you wanna support me in the show,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.880]   we have links to many cards at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.840]   I would appreciate you using those links,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.640]   but if the best deal is not there,
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.560]   please go to wherever you get the most points.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.000]   Usually we have those best deals,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.560]   but there are some cards that we don't have on that page.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.800]   So I totally understand.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.240]   I always want you to get the best deal possible.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.080]   So my big takeaway before I throw a big wrench
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.800]   in all of this is that if you wanna maximize,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.600]   the best path forward is not to think about cashback
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.040]   and points as an absolute decision,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.240]   but rather to think about how you personally value points
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.560]   and make the best choice on a category
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.160]   by category level of where you spend.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.360]   So I value points very highly.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.680]   I think it would be a lot of hassle to have to go
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.240]   and send money to friends or pay bills to generate points
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.480]   so I could go on a trip,
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.080]   but that doesn't mean I value them enough
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.680]   that I'm gonna start spending money on Amazon
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.140]   on a Venture X and paying two and a half cents per point.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.200]   Also, if you have spend in other areas,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.240]   there might be other cards worth looking at
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.040]   on the office supply category, the Chase Inc cash,
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.640]   on the entertainment streaming category,
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.120]   the Capital One Saver or Saver One cards,
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.580]   drug stores, Freedom Unlimited, Freedom Flex,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.480]   and obviously if you pay rent,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.200]   then you definitely need to check out the built card
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.480]   where you can earn up to 100,000 points a year paying rent.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.960]   allthehacks.com/built, B-I-L-T, card is the link there.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.160]   It's also where you pay rent.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.880]   That's also on the allthehacks.com/cards page.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.260]   So check that out if you are a renter.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.360]   So let's get to this big wrench
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.000]   that might throw all of this off
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.280]   and the wrench is welcome bonuses.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.000]   And the reason it might throw all this off
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.560]   is that the return on spending
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.120]   when you're earning a welcome bonus is actually so big
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.120]   that it dwarfs pretty much every card out there.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.540]   So let me paint this picture a little more clearly.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.900]   I pulled up the 10 top signup bonuses
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.160]   that I've found in the last few years
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.960]   with the absolute best one
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.220]   being the Chase Reserve launch bonus,
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.900]   which you got 100,000 chase points,
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.760]   which are worth as much as an effective $1,500 of cash back
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   if you just book travel in the portal
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.520]   for spending just $4,000.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.440]   I mean, think about that.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.240]   You get $1,500 for spending $4,000.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.400]   So you're earning 25 points per dollar.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.160]   So spending money just like that
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   would get you an effective 37.5% cash back on your spend.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.800]   And that's not even including the points you get
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.620]   on that $4,000 of spend.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.420]   So it doesn't matter what category you're spending money on,
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.320]   whether you're getting 5% or 3% cash back
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.780]   or four X points or even six X points,
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:27.320]   the return on that welcome bonus is absolutely unrivaled.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.580]   But I said that was the best bonus I've seen
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.080]   from an ROI standpoint.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.960]   So what's the full top 10 look like?
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.800]   And keep in mind,
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.160]   I'm just limiting this to transferable points cards.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   So I'm not including some huge hotel bonuses.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.440]   For example, right now the IHG Premier card
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.120]   will give you 175,000 points for $3,000 of spend.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.120]   So you're getting 58 IHG points per dollar.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.180]   But if I look at the top 10 cards all time,
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.820]   it was $71,000 of spend to get all 10 welcome bonuses,
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.600]   but you'd get slightly more than 1.2 million points,
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.820]   which is about 17.3 points per dollar on average,
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.880]   which is wildly better than any other card
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.680]   for any category of spending.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.040]   And even if you just value points at 1 cent,
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.560]   which is really low and really easy to get,
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.240]   that's 17.3% cash back.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   And so my initial reaction was,
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.520]   hey, that's just the 10 best welcome bonus offers.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.720]   So I just looked at the top 10 welcome offers right now.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.360]   And slightly different, but it's $60,000 of spend,
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.720]   it's actually less spend to get 1 million points,
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.320]   so less points, but it still averages 17 points per dollar
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.640]   or an effective 17% cash back.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   So clearly that is the best ROI focusing on welcome bonuses.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.600]   But there are a few reasons why that strategy isn't perfect.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.380]   Well, the best ROI is often on cards
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.160]   that require an average of $6,000 to hit the bonus,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.640]   which means that if you spend $60,000 a year on cards,
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.920]   you're gonna need to be opening up 10 cards a year.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.280]   But if you spend $120,000 a year,
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.360]   that means you need 20 cards a year.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.280]   Now, if you have a player two,
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.600]   which meaning a spouse who's also in this game with you,
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.500]   then 10 to 20 cards a year might not be impossible,
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.440]   but certainly takes a lot of planning and work
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.680]   and would be a tremendous amount more work
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.360]   to repeat four, five, six, seven, eight, nine years in a row.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.040]   One alternative though, could be going after cards
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.240]   with a lower percentage return,
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.360]   but much higher spend bonuses.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.080]   For example, the Venture X business card right now
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   will get you 210,000 points after you spend $30,000,
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.120]   which is only an average of seven points per dollar.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.280]   So shy of that 17 point limit.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.600]   However, if you and your player two did that card each,
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.640]   it would cover the entire $60,000 of spend
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.320]   and still give you a better return
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.600]   than every single cash back or points card
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.760]   I know on any category.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.540]   And by the way, it's much more manageable
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.400]   than opening 10 or 20 cards.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.020]   Even if you do have a player two
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.040]   and are okay managing 10 card openings a year,
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.920]   the sequencing really does matter
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.380]   and that's important to figure out
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.180]   because every issuer and even every card
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.200]   has specific rules about when you're eligible to open it
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.240]   and when you're eligible for the bonus.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.960]   For example, we've talked about the Chase 5/24 rule
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.880]   where you can't have more than five or more cards
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.320]   opened in the past 24 years
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.280]   to get approved for another Chase card.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.840]   There's also this 2/90 rule
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.840]   where you can only get two Amex cards in 90 days.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.280]   And then a lot of the Amex cards have rules
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.880]   about when you're eligible for different bonuses.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.840]   I'm actually thinking I'll just do a whole episode
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.320]   on card approval rules.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.220]   So you make sure you know when you're eligible
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.600]   for a welcome bonus
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.200]   and when you're gonna get approved for a card.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.600]   But just to be clear, this is very possible.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.400]   I remember this amazing post on Twitter
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.920]   that I'll link to in the show notes
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.800]   where this guy and his wife in 2017 opened 26 cards.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   And in one year, they easily earned over 2 million points
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.960]   and their credit scores went up the entire time.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.480]   They started at 670 and 794 as their credit scores
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.040]   and actually ended up at 798 and 805.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.760]   So it's not impossible to convert all of your spend
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.160]   to welcome bonuses.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.380]   But for me, I'm probably gonna end up
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.800]   with a hybrid approach
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.640]   where I maximize my return on the spend from cards
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.440]   in line with what I've done in my card tool
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.820]   without focusing on welcome bonuses.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.600]   But three to four times a year,
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.520]   when we see an amazing welcome bonus, we'll jump on it.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.240]   Especially if it's one
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.880]   that might have a lower rate of return
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.560]   than 15 to 25 points per dollar,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.260]   but that has a high amount of spending
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.800]   and even bigger bonus.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.840]   So yes, you might get the best bonus
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.720]   for 25,000 points on $2,000,
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.000]   but I'm much more interested in a 250,000 points
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.100]   on $20,000 bonus because I get a similar return,
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.840]   but only having to open up one card
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.560]   to spend a lot more and get a much bigger bonus.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.120]   So I'm gonna be focusing on the absolute point return
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.300]   instead of necessarily ROI for each welcome bonus.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.080]   So my final summary and takeaway,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.240]   here's how I'm thinking about things.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.400]   I'm going to continue going after
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.600]   the biggest welcome bonuses three to four times a year
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.540]   that I find them.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.000]   So in the categories where we talked about cash back
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.280]   being a better ROI,
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.400]   I'm probably gonna stop focusing on points.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.120]   That's definitely the Amazon Prime card,
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.040]   probably the Altitude Reserve card.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.080]   As for the big question,
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.880]   which I'm calling the battle of the everything else card,
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.780]   do I keep going 2X points or 3% cash back?
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.240]   Even just since I last said that I think I'm going to do it,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.920]   I've been debating in my head,
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.000]   but I think I'm committed.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.320]   I'm going to get the card.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.720]   I'm going to see how it feels.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.840]   I will share everyone how that goes.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.100]   As soon as I get approved.
