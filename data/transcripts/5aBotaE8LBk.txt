[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]   Hi, my name is Corey. I'm a pastor in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin,
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.060]   and I have been a ministry partner with Desiring God for more than 25 years.
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.340]   You are listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.940]   Corey is someone I want you to meet, and you will in just a moment.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.020]   But first, thank you for joining us on this Monday broadcast of the Ask Pastor John podcast. Today,
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.620]   we field two pastoral questions. They are related. The first is from a listener named Ethan. Pastor John,
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.820]   hello, and thank you for taking my question. My church is considering letting known unbelievers take the Lord's Supper.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.440]   The argument is that it points the unbeliever to the Lord's work on the cross and his future return, a form of outreach.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.060]   What would you say? And a similar question comes from a listener named Matt. Hello, Pastor John. Recently,
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.060]   I've been thinking about nominal church members who participate in the Lord's Supper.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.940]   What happens when an unregenerate person eats the bread and drinks the wine?
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.380]   What is the specific sin that such a person commits? I believe it is sinful for such a person to take part,
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.340]   but why is this the case? Pastor John, what would you say to Ethan and Matt?
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.100]   So let me begin with something blunt to the first part of the question. If your pastors are
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.740]   thinking of welcoming
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.180]   unbelievers to eat the Lord's Supper as a way of pointing them to Jesus,
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.820]   you're probably in the wrong church.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.340]   That is so far from the New Testament and what it teaches
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.420]   about the Lord's Supper that it is very difficult for me to think your pastors are
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.220]   seriously submitted to the authority of Scripture rather than to their own wisdom. So that's my initial blunt response. It is
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.380]   irresponsible and ignorant at best and
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.900]   disobedient and cruel at worst
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.300]   to encourage unbelievers to eat the Lord's Supper. Now, the reason I say cruel is
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.260]   that the warnings Paul gives to eating the Lord's Supper unworthily are
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.300]   ultimately warnings of life and death.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.100]   Here's what he says. This is verse 27 of
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.020]   1 Corinthians 11. "Whoever therefore eats the bread or
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.180]   drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.180]   concerning the body and the blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself and
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.140]   so eat of the bread and drink the cup." Pause.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.740]   What will an unbeliever find if he examines himself? He will find unbelief.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.860]   And that's precisely what Paul intends for us to find.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.020]   Has disobedience of unbelief gotten the upper hand in our lives? If so, get that fixed and don't eat
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.780]   this supper assuming that it doesn't matter. That's the whole point of self-examination.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.780]   So why would you invite
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.220]   unbelievers
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.220]   into that deadly situation?
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.140]   Continue reading. Verse 29. "For anyone who eats or drinks without
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.060]   discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself." Pause.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.220]   Discerning the body means
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.860]   grasping the utter uniqueness and glory of
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.340]   Jesus' physical body as an infinitely valuable sacrifice for sins,
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.380]   which unbelievers do not do.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.220]   Verse 30. "That is why many of you are weak and ill and some have died.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.580]   That's why I say it is cruel to encourage
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.340]   unbelievers to eat this supper." Verse 31. "But if we judged ourselves
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.340]   truly, we would not be judged.
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.060]   But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.500]   condemned along with the world."
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.220]   In other words, true believers
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.820]   who need to be disciplined because of the way they're eating the Lord's Supper
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.580]   can be saved even if they die
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.660]   through discipline for taking the Lord's Supper. But what would become of an unbeliever?
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.340]   They're not going to be saved.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.740]   When Jesus said and when Paul said that each time we eat the Lord's Supper,
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.340]   we do it in remembrance of him, he did not have in mind a kind of remembrance which an
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.860]   unbeliever has of merely
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.980]   remembering that there was such a person as Jesus. Maybe there was, maybe he existed, and he died for sins.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.460]   Maybe he died for sins.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.060]   He meant that we should remember the preciousness of what
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.860]   happened when Jesus died and shed his blood. The memory is a loving memory, a thankful memory, not an
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.420]   unbelieving memory. And this is made
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.860]   much more clear as if it could be in 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.620]   not 11, but 10,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.540]   16 to 22. Not many people go here to get clear about the Lord's Supper and what it means,
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.740]   but it's very important. The Lord's Supper, according to 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.260]   16 following, is a
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.540]   participation in Christ.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:45.020]   So here's what it says, verse 16, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.780]   participation, a sharing in the blood of Christ, the bread that we break? Is it not a
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.700]   sharing, a participation in the body of Christ?
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.140]   Because there is one
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:07.660]   bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread." In other words, the loaf
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.500]   represents the church, the body of Christ,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.020]   sharing in, participating in the life of Christ. This is impossible to conceive of as
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.220]   unbelievers. Verse 21, "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.180]   You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.700]   Are we stronger than he?" In other words, Paul was explicitly dealing with
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.140]   unbelievers who have their kinds of religious ceremonies,
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:45.420]   where they eat and drink, and believers who have our kind of ceremony, where we eat and drink, and he's denying that you can
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.580]   participate in both. It is a tragic misunderstanding of the glorious transaction
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.160]   between Christ and his people at the Lord's Supper, if pastors try to
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.940]   reinterpret this supper as an evangelistic tool to point unbelievers to Jesus. Tragic. The glorious transaction is this,
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:12.340]   first, there is a remembering of what the foundation of our faith is in the blood and body of Christ sacrificed for us.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:20.300]   Second, there is a communion, or as chapter 10 says, a sharing in, a participation in Christ
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.380]   spiritually, as we feed upon
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.660]   him by faith and are nourished and satisfied in our souls.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:37.380]   No unbeliever can do this, and that's the meaning of the moment. It's not designed that they should. Let me end like this.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.820]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.220]   The Lord's Supper points
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.580]   unbelievers
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.380]   to Christ and makes crystal clear that they are not
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:57.460]   participants in it, in Christ. They are not participants in
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:04.980]   forgiveness. They are not participants in salvation. They're not participants in the second coming of rescue from wrath.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.820]   That's what the prohibition from
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:15.500]   participating communicates as they watch us enjoy Jesus. It communicates, "We want you.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.740]   We want you in watching this to see what you're missing." And, Tony,
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.500]   I can testify with great feeling that it works that way.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.300]   I remember, for example, a man who sat in the balcony right in front of me in our old
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:37.340]   sanctuary, month after month, year after year, on every Communion Sunday,
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.100]   believing with his believing wife,
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.340]   never missing a Sunday horribly. I knew the man. We had conversations about Jesus.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:52.460]   He's a blatant unbeliever, and during Communion when I said, "If you're not yet trusting Christ,
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.660]   just let the tray go by and
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:02.580]   ponder the beauty of the gospel," and I would look right at him when I said those words, right at him, in his face, about
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.700]   40 feet away. We knew each other.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.540]   Then, one Communion Sunday,
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:14.340]   he stopped at the door, took my hand, and said, "Pastor, we need to talk." And at
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:21.140]   1030 p.m. the following Wednesday night, God saved him, and I baptized him a few weeks later.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.300]   That's the way it works. Don't kick the unbeliever out of your services.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:32.860]   Show them the beauty of the gospel and tell them that they shouldn't participate yet,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.940]   but oh may God grant you eyes to see, because we want you to enjoy this with us.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:45.900]   Thank you for sharing that with us, Pastor John. He had a heart attack just a few months later and died. Oh my. It was absolutely
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.420]   stunning that his whole family was just
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:55.780]   amazed and thrilled that God had saved him in the 11th hour. Oh, wow. Amen. Praise God.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.860]   Thank you for sharing that with us, Pastor John. Well,
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:06.100]   speaking of pastors, at the start of this episode, you heard from Corey, a pastor in Wisconsin and a friend of ours.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.380]   Corey is here on the line with me now. Corey, I wanted to chat with you just briefly.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.940]   It's an honor to connect with you. An honor because I know that you have a long track record
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:22.380]   supporting DG, over 25 years supporting Pastor John's ministry, which goes back before there even was a DG, back to the old
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:29.100]   cassette tape sermon days back at the church, which is amazing. So tell us right now, Corey, today, we're talking about today,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.900]   what is it that makes you so eager to be a ministry partner with Desiring God?
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   It's easy to be a ministry partner.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:44.300]   I financially support the ministry because Desiring God gives their resources away and the resources they give away are worth having.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.700]   But financial support has to come from somewhere and both the church
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:55.940]   I serve and my wife and I are happy to support Desiring God financially. And for me, the Ask Pastor John
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:03.500]   podcast has been helpful both personally and pastorally. Many people in our church listen to the podcast and many
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   watch and learn from the Look at the Book episodes and many more read every day's Solid Joys devotional.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.000]   Wonderful.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.020]   I love that the podcast answers are grounded in the Bible and Pastor John also brings
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.260]   enormously helpful
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.580]   application for living. And Look at the Book has been illuminating and that's an understatement.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.220]   And Solid Joys is a solid way to begin a day. All of DG's
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:38.300]   resources have helped people understand God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   And that might be a motto, but it's also the main thing and DG aims to keep the main thing the main thing.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.940]   Amen. Outstanding. Thank you, Corey. And what would you say to somebody who's listening right now?
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.940]   They've enjoyed the Look at the Book videos, the Solid Joy devotionals,
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.700]   the APJ podcast, but they've never thought about the financial side of the ministry. They've never considered how expensive
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.820]   this ministry really is.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.800]   What would you say to someone right now who's thinking of giving that first gift or a
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.380]   reoccurring gift, even a small gift of like 20 bucks a month.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.140]   What would you say to those people who are about to make this next step of commitment with DG?
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.100]   I am glad they're thinking about it.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.380]   I don't know of any ministry that gets more bang for the buck than Desiring God and
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:27.820]   they find new and better ways to get their messages to as many people in as many places as they can.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.740]   It's fabulous. I love that. Thank you.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:38.060]   You're a pastor and you not only give personally, you and your wife, but your church officially supports DG as well.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:44.580]   What would you say to other pastors or maybe to the listener who wants to bring up this conversation with their church leaders about what
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.120]   that would look like for a local church to support DG?
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.460]   How would you encourage them? Well, I encourage everyone to think about
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:59.180]   sensitively suggesting to your church leaders that Desiring God is a ministry partner worthy of
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:05.140]   regular support in your church budget. It helps foster a sense of partnership.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:11.180]   We get more interested in the good things, the great stories that we hear from DG.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:17.020]   And they're doing great things and there are great stories and people in our church are tuned in to what is
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:23.300]   happening in the world and God is working and working through Desiring God and we love it.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:31.020]   We will always include Desiring God in our regular budget and we do some over and above things with some regularity as well.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.580]   Well, we love serving the local church. So to hear this blesses our heart. Corey,
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.020]   thank you so much for spending a few moments with us today.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.900]   Oh, it's my pleasure.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.420]   And if you want to join us as a ministry partner, you, your family, or even your church,
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.460]   to support us as we make and spread new Bible teaching resources to bless churches around the globe.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.900]   You can partner with us right now. Go to DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:01.820]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate. We appreciate it. I am Tony Renke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday. Thanks for listening.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.820]   [End]
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.820]   [End]
