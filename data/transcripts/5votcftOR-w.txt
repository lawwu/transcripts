[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.020]   - Christian hedonism is about finding our joy in God
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.800]   through the person and work of Christ.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.480]   And Pastor John, you rightly warn us
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.900]   against finding our joy in our joy,
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.680]   or loving God rather than loving God.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.460]   We've talked about this in episodes 326 and 345.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.480]   So how does this warning fit with the passages
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.080]   of the psalmist where he says that he finds delight
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.720]   in God's commandments and law?
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.880]   How is delight in God's written word,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.120]   a delight in God himself?
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.800]   - Excellent question.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.240]   Let me put those texts that were mentioned
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.680]   right in front of us.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.520]   His delight is in the law of the Lord
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.940]   and on his law he meditates, that's Psalm 1.
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.560]   Psalm 19, the precepts of the Lord are rejoicing the heart.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.800]   Psalm 119.16, I will delight in your statutes.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   And Psalm 119.11, your testimonies are my heritage forever
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   for they are the joy of my heart.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.680]   So from those texts, I would say clearly,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.680]   it is a godly and good thing to feel delight in God's word.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.840]   So if I've said anything that contradicts that,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.880]   like I don't want people to be rejoicing in God's word,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.860]   then I have misspoken.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.520]   Regardless of whatever Piper says, that's clear.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.320]   So let me clarify my view.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.320]   I have never intended to say joy in anything but God is sin.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.100]   I have always meant to say having your greatest joy,
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.100]   your ultimate joy in anything but God is sin, it's idolatry.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.320]   And having any joy in anything that is not God,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.500]   that fails to be for God's sake is sin.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.540]   In other words, you can have joy in something
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.980]   that's not God if it is for God's sake
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.380]   and have it not be sin.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.500]   So maybe the question that would be helpful to ask
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.180]   is what does that mean?
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.180]   Joy in something created for the sake of the creator.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.260]   And here's a couple of some pointers
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.260]   that I think help us just experience joy in non-God
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.760]   for the sake of God biblically.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.380]   Psalm 43 verse four,
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.380]   "I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy."
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.440]   Now, literally in the Hebrew, God my exceeding joy is,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   I will go to the altar of God, to God the joy of my joy.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.860]   That's really clear in Hebrew.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.860]   This points to the way that we can have joy in other things
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.160]   because if God is the joy of our joy,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.240]   then the joy we're having in his word, say,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.500]   is not idolatrous.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.100]   If God is the joy of our joy,
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.700]   if at the heart of our joy in something God made
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.360]   is what we are tasting and seeing of God himself.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   In the joy that we experience at God's altar
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.360]   or Christ's cross or God's word,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.680]   there's an experience of God.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.880]   That's what's implied there.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.360]   God is the joy of my joy.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.800]   These joys come from God.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.320]   They are something of God's own goodness.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.400]   And when we taste them, we are tasting something of God.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.200]   He's the sweetness of all our joys.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.560]   If you taste honey and you enjoy honey,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.120]   that honey was made sweet for you by God.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.720]   Therefore, it must be something of God.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.820]   And if you don't taste God in that,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.120]   then you're starting to move towards idolatry
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.960]   in your very eating of a peanut butter honey sandwich.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.120]   Here's another pointer from Psalm 40, verse 16.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.360]   May those who love your salvation say continually,
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.300]   great is the Lord.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.820]   Well, those who love your salvation,
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.200]   don't just say great is your salvation.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.000]   They say great is the Lord.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.440]   In other words, the joy of our salvation
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.080]   is the joy in what it reveals about the Lord
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   and the joy that it brings in taking us to the Lord.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.440]   That's what salvation is.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.960]   So when I say I love the salvation of God,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.840]   I mean, I love the God of salvation
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.080]   'cause he wrought it and it's taking me to him
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.080]   and he's the ultimate joy that I have.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.040]   One more from 1 Thessalonians 2, 19.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.320]   For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.020]   before the Lord Jesus said he's coming?
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.960]   Is it not you, Thessalonians?
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.160]   So Paul is saying my joy, my crown,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.080]   my boasting before the Lord is the people
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.000]   that God has used me to save.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.880]   He doesn't mean that the Lord won't be his boast
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.040]   or his joy or his crown.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.240]   He said, let him who boasts boast in the Lord.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.440]   The Lord will be his joy and his crown.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.920]   What he's saying is before the Lord,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.640]   the Thessalonians will be the ground
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.540]   and evidence of God's mighty grace in his life,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.440]   using him to bring them out of darkness into light.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.920]   The point is not to compare the Thessalonians with the Lord,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.760]   but to compare them with lesser evidences
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.960]   of God's power in his life.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.280]   As I look at my life and I think what will be the token
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.900]   or the evidence of my joy and my crown
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.480]   and my boasting before the Lord?
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.520]   It's gonna be you.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.300]   You are the trophy of the grace that poured through my life
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.740]   as I trusted in the Lord.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.940]   So my answer to the question is that Christians delight
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.920]   in many things that are not God.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.080]   So yes, we delight in many things that are not God.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.680]   We delight in God's word, we delight in God's works,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.420]   we delight in God's people, we delight in the gift of food
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.860]   and marriage and friends,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.020]   but we do not delight most in these.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.100]   We delight most in God.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.520]   Paul said, I count everything as loss
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.880]   because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.180]   my Lord, compared to Christ, all these things
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.880]   in which we might boast or delight are as nothing.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.040]   And all our delight ultimately resides in God.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.480]   He's the joy of all our joys.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.920]   There's something of God in every holy joy
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.680]   because God created the joy and he gives us the joy
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.660]   to show something of himself.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.880]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.080]   This reminds me of an old episode we recorded,
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.360]   one of the early ones titled,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.920]   How Do I Know If I Love the Gifts More Than the Giver?
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.400]   That's episode number 55.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.120]   You can check that out in the podcast archive,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   most easily found by using the free app
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.200]   for the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.400]   Well, a podcast listener writes in to confess,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.900]   I want sin to bother me more.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.960]   How can I reclaim my heart when it seems to be so calloused?
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.800]   That's tomorrow.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.240]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
