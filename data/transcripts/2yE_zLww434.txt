[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   One thing you can do when using checks is you can opt out of pre-approved offers of credit or
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.360]   insurance. I don't like doing that because there are a lot of credit card companies that send
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.880]   elevated offers that I want to be able to get access to. What I did notice looking through my
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.340]   own report, which I did pull, is that it does have some of my personal information, a few inquiries
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.820]   from credit union accounts mostly, and then a ton of requests and inquiries from TransUnion
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.480]   slash Credit Karma. I think Credit Karma is just querying all the things they have access to query
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.320]   to get as much data about you as they can. It makes me wonder if I should delete my Credit Karma
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.540]   account, but I have not. They do give you a score. The score took me an extra day from the actual
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.660]   disclosure report. I got a score of 682. I didn't have a lot of context on that. They said it ranges
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.120]   from 100 to 899 with higher score, meaning lower risk. I guess I am not at any of the cutoffs for
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.920]   risky bank account user, which hopefully makes sense.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.360]   I don't think I've been doing anything crazy.
