[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   We apologise for the poor sound quality during the following sermon by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.320]   This was due to a deterioration of the original recording,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.000]   and although it's been digitally restored to improve audibility,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.400]   we trust that it will not spoil your enjoyment of this sermon by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.600]   are to be found in the Gospel according to Saint John in chapter 5,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.200]   verses 31 to 35.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.280]   Verses 31 to 35 in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.880]   If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.240]   There is another that beareth witness of me,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.200]   and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.200]   Ye sent unto John, and he bear witness unto the truth.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.040]   But I receive not testimony from men, but these things I say that ye might be saved.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:18.400]   He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.160]   We come back once more to a consideration of these important verses,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.720]   and we do so for the reason that our blessed Lord himself gives in that 34th verse,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.800]   which I have just read to you.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.200]   He says, "I receive not testimony from men," by which he means, "I really don't need it.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.360]   I don't stand in need of it."
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.600]   But, he says, "I am nevertheless quoting to you the testimony of John the Baptist,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.840]   that ye might be saved."
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.160]   That was his whole reason, indeed, for continuing this conversation,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.960]   as we have seen on several Sunday evenings, with these Jews.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.840]   These Jews who were criticizing him and completely misunderstanding him.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.600]   Our Lord, you remember, had healed a man there at the pool of Bethesda
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.640]   who had been a cripple for 38 years.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.240]   But because he'd done it on a Sunday, these Jews, the Teichnambrids,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.040]   they said that he was disobeying God's commandment and God's will and God's law.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.720]   And thus they were filled with a spirit of hatred and of antagonism towards him.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.800]   But he speaks to them, he reasons with them.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.640]   But they say, by saying that, you're making yourself equal with God.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.560]   Far from disputing or denying that, our Lord makes it perfectly plain to them
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.600]   that that is precisely what he does claim.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.680]   That he is one with the Father, one in understanding, one in knowledge,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   one in purpose, one in object.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.720]   That as the Father hath life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.440]   And that he, indeed, he has committed the judgment of the world to him.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.960]   He makes this most exalted claim.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.560]   And yet, you see, they still remain obdurate.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.200]   They still resist the truth.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.640]   And it wouldn't have been a bit surprising from our standpoint
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.200]   if our Lord at this stage had just turned his back upon them and had finished with them.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.840]   But he doesn't.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.920]   He's put it plainly and clearly to them.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.040]   Still they don't see it.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.800]   And then he says, well now, let me try to understand you.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.600]   If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   By which he means, I can see that from your standpoint,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.960]   that you're not going to believe it merely on my word.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   You say in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall everything be established.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.320]   Very well, he says.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm not merely saying these things myself.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.320]   There is another that beareth witness of me,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.560]   and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.920]   Now that's a reference to God himself.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.240]   But how has God borne witness to the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.200]   How has God testified that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God?
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.800]   Well, here's the first.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.360]   Our Lord says, you yourself sent a deputation to John the Baptist.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.280]   And he bare witness unto the truth.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   You'll find the full report of that in the first chapter of this gospel,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.680]   according to Saint John, verses 19 to 39, roughly.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.280]   There it is all in detail.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.400]   How they sent their deputation to John, saying, "Art thou the Christ?"
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.760]   And if you're not the Christ, are you then Elijah?
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.240]   If you're not Elijah, are you that prophet that should come?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.320]   Who are you?
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.080]   Well now then, our Lord tells them here that he is directing their attention
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.600]   to the answers which John the Baptist gave to their very question.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.080]   And what was it John said?
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.320]   We've already been considering it here, was the first thing.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.160]   John made it perfectly plain and clear that he himself was not the Christ.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.480]   He says, "I am not worthy to undo the leptchit of Yeshu.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.200]   I am merely the forerunner, the voice crying in the wilderness.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.840]   Prepare ye the way of the Lord."
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.360]   "No, no," he says, "it's the one who is coming after me,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.640]   who is preferred before me, for he was before me."
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.840]   He says, "I am but the friend of the bridegroom."
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.880]   He's the bridegroom.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.240]   Who is he?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.320]   Well, he's the one, he says, who's come from heaven.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.960]   He is the one who is above all.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.720]   Indeed, he says explicitly that he is the Son of God.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:12.160]   The one, he says, who sent me to baptize, referring to God, told me that the Messiah
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.800]   was the one on whom I should see the Holy Spirit descending in the form of a dove.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   And I testified that John, that as I baptized Jesus of Nazareth in the Jordan, as we had
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.280]   finished, I saw the Holy Spirit coming upon him in the form of a dove and abiding upon him.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:42.880]   And therefore, I bear record that he is the Son of God.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.320]   Very well, says our Lord to these Jews.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   Now, take your own evidence.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.360]   You yourselves sent your deputation to John to ask the question, "Who art thou?"
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.800]   That was John's reply.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.760]   Why don't you believe him?
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.680]   He says, "If you'd only believed John, you'd have believed something that could save you,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.640]   and that is the first thing that is essential to salvation,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:12.480]   that we believe and know that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God."
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:20.240]   Salvation, deliverance from the guilt of sin, deliverance from the power of sin,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.000]   deliverance from the pollution of sin, deliverance from hell, deliverance for heaven.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.680]   That's what it means to be saved.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.040]   I'm saying these things, says our Lord, that you may be saved.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   And no man can be saved unless he believes and knows that the Son of God has come down
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.760]   into this world in order to save us.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.280]   John testified to this, that he is the Son of God.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:52.560]   Very well, the second thing he testified was, that he testified was, the way in which he does
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.360]   save us.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.600]   And we looked at that last Sunday night.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.040]   John stood one day with his disciples around him, and Jesus of Nazareth approached.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:12.400]   And John stood back and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.720]   "Behold," he says.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.120]   It's an exclamation of amazement and of astonishment.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.000]   It's not merely an exaltation to them to look at him.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.840]   He says, "Behold the phenomenon.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.400]   Here is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.800]   Oh, we are reminded of it here by the bread and the wine.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.680]   How does Jesus Christ save us?
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.200]   How does he save us from the guilt of our sins?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.760]   I'll tell you.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   He saves us by taking our sins upon himself.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:59.040]   Who, his own self, bear our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sin,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.600]   should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.480]   God the Father has taken our sins and has put them on the head of his own Son, his own Lamb,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.760]   and has smitten him, has struck him.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.960]   He was wounded for our transgression.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.840]   He bore the iniquities of many.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:32.800]   His body was broken, his blood was shed, and so he has taken away our sins.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:40.240]   He takes away the guilt by dying for us on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.720]   No man can be saved without believing that.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.320]   It isn't enough to believe he's the Son of God and that he came into this world.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.280]   We must believe, as Paul says, in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.720]   It is only in his crucifixion that he takes away our sins.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.800]   He died for our transgression.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.400]   He was delivered up for our offenses.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.280]   It is by the blood of Christ that our sins are blotted out.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.720]   John the Baptist said so.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.480]   So our Lord turns to these people and says, "Why don't you believe him?
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.800]   Why don't you believe the reply he gave to your own deputation?
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.080]   If you do, it'll save you."
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.680]   He delivers us from the guilt of our sins in that way.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.400]   But, you see, that isn't all.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.120]   John didn't finish at that point.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.840]   John went on.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.520]   He's got something else which he wants to say and which he did say to this deputation.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.960]   What is this further something?
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.720]   Well, it's perfectly plain and clear in every one of the four Gospels.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:03.440]   I read at the beginning the third chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Luke,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.040]   a portion of it, because it's there stated particularly clearly.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.640]   But it's there also in the Gospel according to Matthew.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.520]   It's there in the first Matthew 3, Mark 1.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:21.440]   There in the third of Luke, and then again in the first chapter of this Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.600]   What is this?
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.840]   Well, here it is.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   Let me quote it to you again from Luke 3 16.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.120]   "I indeed baptize you with water,
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.920]   but one mightier than I cometh, the lecher to whose shoes I am unworthy to unloose.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.520]   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire."
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.600]   That's the thing to which I'm referring.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.800]   Now, it's obvious that this is something which is of supreme importance.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.560]   Every one of the Gospels contains it and mentions it,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.800]   and that is in and of itself an indication that it is one of those things that we cannot afford
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.160]   to neglect or to miss.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.840]   It is indeed a vital part of John the Baptist's testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.280]   He says he's not only the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.880]   he is the coming one who is going to baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:39.760]   Now, this testimony of John at this point is of extreme importance in two main respects,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.840]   and I must refer to them.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:48.080]   It is of supreme importance in the first instance as it attests and proves
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.920]   the person of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:13:01.120]   Here is, as it were, the crowning proof of all that Jesus of Nazareth is not only the Son of God,
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   but the long-anticipated and expected Messiah, the Deliverer, the Savior,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:13.120]   to whose coming the children of Israel had been looking forward throughout the centuries.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:20.080]   Here is the final proof of this in what he did on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.600]   Now, let me put it to you like this.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.640]   You go back to your Old Testament, and there you will find this promise
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.760]   stated in different places and in different ways.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.400]   That God was going to send a Deliverer into the world,
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.200]   he was going to send a great personage who would deliver his people,
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.400]   and this was the special promise that he would pour out his Spirit upon them.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   It is called the promise of the Father.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   Now, you remember how the Apostle Peter, preaching at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.240]   he made a great thing of this in that sermon of his which is recorded
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.720]   in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.240]   You remember, don't you, the incident?
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.960]   Where these people were, they had come up from different parts of the world
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.280]   to the great feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem, and suddenly they began to hear a most amazing news,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.720]   that there was a handful of people, very ordinary men from Galilee,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.160]   who suddenly were all beginning to speak in other languages.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.600]   And this was a phenomenon, and everybody gathered together, all were amazed and marveled,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.000]   saying one to another, "Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.600]   And, oh, here we have every man in our own tongue wherein we were born,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.200]   Carthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and of the dwellers of Mesopotamia, and so on, and so forth."
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.920]   And they all came together, and they were amazed, and they said, "What meanest this?"
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.320]   Some said, "These men are full of new wine, they're drunk."
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.600]   Then Peter stood up in the midst of them and began to preach, and this is what he said,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.560]   having explained that they were not drunken, as they supposed,
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.640]   being that it was but the third hour of the day, meaning by that nine o'clock in the morning,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:07.840]   he said this, "Is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel, when he said,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.920]   'It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.840]   and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.360]   and your old men shall dream dreams, and on my servants and on my handmaidens
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.840]   I will pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy, and I will show wonders
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:38.240]   in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The sun shall
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.960]   be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:49.680]   come, and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.960]   "Ye men of Israel," says Peter, "hear these words."
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.520]   And then he begins to tell them about Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:06.160]   "a man approved of God among them by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him." He says,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.960]   "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken him by
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:17.760]   wicked hands and crucified and slain, whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death,
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.600]   because it was not possible that he should be hidden of it." Then he says, "Listen to this,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.200]   therefore being a prophet and knowing that God hath sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.760]   of his loins according to the flesh he gave it, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:40.320]   he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.360]   neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses,
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:54.160]   therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received the promise of the Father,
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:03.920]   the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which you now see and hear.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:10.960]   Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ." Now what does all that mean? Well, this is the
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:27.360]   argument. Here you see is the ancient promise that the Messiah, the one who was going to save,
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.320]   would be the one to whom would be given in this abundance this gift of the Holy Spirit
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:40.400]   to pour forth upon people. And therefore you see Peter's argument.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.840]   But before I work that out with you, let me remind you of this.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.720]   Not only did Joel say that, not only do you find the same prophecy in different language
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.840]   in the prophecy of Ezekiel and of Isaiah. Listen to John the Baptist.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.440]   "Here's the last of the great succession of prophets," and this is what he says,
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:12.000]   "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, this one who is coming after me, this Jesus.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.600]   I'm not the Christ he is." Very well, John had prophesied it.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.760]   Indeed, our Lord himself had prophesied it and had claimed it.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:28.720]   Go home and read at your leisure chapters 14, 15, and 16 of this gospel according to Saint John.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.800]   He says, "Look here, I'm not going to leave you often. Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.680]   I'm going to send you another Comforter. He will come and he will teach you and he will
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.360]   lead you into all truth." That's his message. Go home and read it. "When he is come," he says,
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.760]   "he shall convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment."
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.600]   The Holy Ghost that I'm going to send.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:19:00.720]   And then you remember that after his crucifixion and burial and his rising again,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.120]   we are told in the first chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:12.240]   that he suddenly appeared amongst his disciples and he said this to them,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.280]   "Stay where you are in Jerusalem. Don't go away yet."
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.440]   Because he said, "I'm going to fulfill that promise which I made to you."
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.800]   And then he goes back and he reminds them of what John the Baptist had spoken to them.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.360]   Being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.520]   but wait for the promise of the Father which says, "He, ye have heard of me? For John truly
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:46.000]   baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence."
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.400]   And then he explains it more fully in verse 8, "But ye shall receive power after that the
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.440]   Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem and Samaria
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.840]   and to the uttermost parts of the earth." Now then, this is, you see, what Peter therefore
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.880]   began to say on this day of Pentecost. He said, "Men and women, why don't you face the facts?"
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:15.520]   You remember that Jesus from Nazareth who used to be here in this city preaching and
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.880]   teaching and working miracles, who claimed to be the Son of God and you wouldn't believe him?
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.920]   And you all shouted out together, "Away with him! Crucify him!" said, "Release unto us Barabbas!"
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:32.720]   "I'm telling you," said Peter, "that this which has happened, this ability to speak in these
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   unknown languages which is amazing you and which some of you seem to attribute to drunkenness,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.560]   this is nothing but the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy. When he said that the Messiah would
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.680]   have this gift and would shed it abroad, he's done it. That's his argument.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.320]   This," he said, "is the verification of the fulfillment
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:02.640]   of that which was prophesied by John the Baptist." "Can't you see it?" said Peter.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:09.760]   "Can't you see that the shedding forth of this is the proof that the Jesus whom you delivered up
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.920]   and condemned in your ignorance and whom your rulers incited you to do so, can't you see that
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.520]   he is the Christ?" And a number of them were pricked in their hearts and cried out, saying,
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:30.480]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.880]   of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin, and you shall receive
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.800]   the Holy Ghost." Well, you see, this is the argument.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.840]   John the Baptist fixes on this because he knew it was given to him to understand
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:57.360]   that this was the final and the clinching proof that this Jesus is the Christ of the Deliverer,
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:04.240]   the Savior, he who sends out and forth the Holy Spirit. He is the Christ.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:13.760]   And he has done so. Now, my friends, I must therefore ask you a simple question at this point.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.480]   You and I are looking back upon these facts.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.320]   The day of Pentecost is a fact of history.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.240]   Isn't it perfectly clear that there would never have been a Christian church
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.120]   were it not for the day of Pentecost? You remember the quest for disappointed,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.440]   unhappy disciples? What suddenly turns them into these blazing evangelists?
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:48.720]   It was the shedding forth of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost as I am hoping to show you.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.560]   And that is the final proof that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.200]   Well, therefore, once more, this is the fact with which we are faced this evening.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:06.720]   But here we have this evidence and this testimony of history
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:17.600]   that the Son of God has come down from heaven to us, has been in this world.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:23.840]   These things I say unto you, says our Lord, that you might be saved.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:31.040]   Here's further evidence. Have you considered it? Have you given its due weight to the facts
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.280]   of that which happened on the day of Pentecost? Have you seen its meaning,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:43.440]   its import, its argument, that the Christ has come? That this is nothing but a fact of history.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:50.240]   There it is, then, I say again, attesting and proving the claim of Jesus Christ to be
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:56.160]   the only begotten Son of God. But that isn't the only thing that's important about it. There's
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:04.960]   something else. And this second thing is that it is of vital importance
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.040]   with regard to the whole question of the nature of salvation.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:20.480]   Now, so many people stumble at this. There are so many people who think that they're Christians,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.920]   whereas in reality they're not, because they don't know what Christianity is.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.640]   They've never realized it. They've never known the full content of this word "salvation."
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:40.160]   What is salvation? Well, I've already emphasized that it means that we are delivered from the guilt
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:49.440]   of our sins. We've always got to start with that, and that is why the first statement is that he is
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:56.400]   the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. But you know, salvation doesn't stop at
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:05.360]   that. It goes on. We need, as I said, to be delivered also from the power of sin and from
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:13.280]   the pollution of sin. And it's here we begin to have an insight into that. For Jesus Christ is
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:19.520]   not only the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin, he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Ghost.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:28.560]   What does it mean? Well, there is nothing that is more important for our consideration than just
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:36.160]   this. John puts it very perfectly for us, you remember, by comparing and confessing
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.000]   his baptism with the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.400]   And the tragedy is that so many think of Christianity in terms of John the Baptist's
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:56.640]   baptism. But that isn't it, as John said. Now look here at this dramatic situation there by
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:05.360]   the side of Jordan. Here were all these people who'd come out and had listened to John.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:13.840]   They'd never seen a man like this before. He was the prophet, and there hadn't been a prophet from
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:21.600]   God for 400 years. They'd heard of this strange man who lived there in the wilderness, eating
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:28.560]   nothing but locusts and wild honey, not dressed like people who live in king's palaces, as our
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.720]   Lord put it, but with nothing on but a camel hair shirt and a leather girdle. And they'd gone out
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.840]   in great excitement and curiosity. It was the talking point, to use the modern jargon, in
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.880]   Jerusalem. And they'd gone crowding out to see this strange phenomenon there in the wilderness.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.760]   And John had spoken to them, and he'd addressed them, and they'd looked into his blazing eyes
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.520]   as he had poured forth this mighty rhetoric of his, and had presented them with the truth.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.520]   And then the account goes on to tell us this,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.760]   that as all men amused in their hearts
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:15.040]   concerning John, and said unto themselves whether he be the Christ or not,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.840]   John answered, saying unto them all, "Can't you see it? Here is the preacher, John the Baptist,
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.480]   and there is the congregation he's just been addressing. He's finished his sermon, and he's
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.080]   there doing something, and they're all talking to one another, and they said, "What is this,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.400]   men? Who is he? We've never seen or heard anything like this before. This must be the Christ. This
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.480]   must be the man we've been expecting. This must be the prophet." All men mused in their hearts of
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:49.280]   John whether he were the Christ or not. John suddenly flashes upon them and says, "I am not
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:28:01.440]   the Christ. I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the lecher to whose
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.000]   shoes I am unworthy to unloose, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire."
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.040]   "This isn't Christianity," he says, "it's coming. Mine isn't Christianity. I'm only the preparation."
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.400]   Very well, let's look at the difference between the baptism of John and the baptism of Christ,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.360]   because I say the tragedy is that so many think that John's baptism is Christianity,
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.200]   and because they've conformed to that, they think they've got everything, and they haven't begun to
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.880]   understand Christianity. No, no, this is salvation, not what John had, what has John got to give.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.120]   Well, listen to him. John's is a baptism with water.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:47.920]   What did that lead to? What, indeed, was it even meant to do?
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:59.120]   John makes it quite plain and clear to them. That is merely a call to repentance.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.000]   That is simply a call to men and women to examine themselves and to confess their sin.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.360]   John's baptism is just a call to men to live a right and an upright and an honest life.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:24.160]   Recall, therefore, us in that third chapter of Luke's Gospel, in very simple manner,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.040]   in reply to the three deputations that you remember came to John. Here is the first.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.560]   "The first people came and asked him, 'What shall we do then?' And this is what John replied,
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.920]   'He answereth and saith unto them, 'He that hath two coats,
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:50.400]   let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.'
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:57.760]   In other words, said John to these people, 'If you've got two coats, and you know a man or a
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.880]   woman who hasn't got a coat at all, just give one of your two coats to the other, that's all.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.600]   Or if you've got superabundance of meat and of food in your larder, and you know somebody
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.400]   who's starving, give him of your excess, that's all he asked for.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.520]   You needn't be a Christian to do that, need you?
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:24.240]   There are many people who deny Christ completely in the world who do that, and yet there are many
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.960]   who think that that is Christianity. It isn't, says John. That's my level, that's morality,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:34.400]   that's religion, that isn't Christianity. Well, then there came a second deputation,
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.520]   you remember, the publicans, the tax-gatherers.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:44.480]   "And they said unto him, 'Master, what shall we do?' And he said unto them,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:51.920]   'Exact no more than that which is appointed you.' In other words, he said, 'Look here,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:57.120]   be honest, don't cheat. If you know that a given man is to pay a certain amount of tax,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.880]   charge him that. Don't add on something, and put the excess into your own pocket.'" That's all.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:14.400]   Is that Christianity? Well, I hope that every moral, decent person comes up to that standard.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:20.320]   That's not Christianity. You don't need to be a Christian in order to do that. That's morality.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.080]   And yet, you see, people think it's wonderful if they do that they're Christians. They never
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.600]   do anybody any harm, they do good. They're always straight and upright in their income
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.400]   tax and so on, and therefore they're Christians. That makes them Christian.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:36.960]   I know that's John's baptism. "Then came the soldiers likewise, and demanded of him, saying,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:44.400]   'And what shall we do?' And he said unto them, 'Do violence, do violence to no man,
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:51.760]   neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.'"
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:59.440]   John does not tell them for a moment that they're not to act as soldiers, and in a war,
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.160]   if necessary, to shoot, to kill men, in the way that they then did. But he says,
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:09.360]   "Don't do violence to any man." He says, "Neither accuse any falsely." It's a part of your duty to
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:17.520]   accuse people truly, but not falsely. "And honour your bond, keep your bargain. If you've made a
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.040]   contract with a man to do a given piece of work for a given wage, be content with your wages.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.920]   Try and get better if you like, but if you've made a bond and a contract, honour it and keep it.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.200]   Don't go back on your word. That's it. Is that Christianity? I say no, that's morality.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.920]   That is John the Baptist, that's religion. And yet you see there are thousands of people still
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.200]   probably in this country who think that they're Christians for these reasons. They do a bit of
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.320]   good, they give away the extra coat that they can do without, and they're honest and scrupulous and
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.720]   fair in their business dealings, and they honour their bond and they're never violent,
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.160]   and they never accuse anybody falsely. And therefore they say, 'We are Christians,
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.840]   we are good living people, never done anybody any harm, always try to do good,
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:08.080]   therefore we are Christians.' No, no,' says John, 'I the Christ, out upon the cross of your spirit,
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:14.400]   I indeed baptise you with water, but that's not the thing.'
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:21.440]   No, no,' says John, 'this isn't it, this is only preparation for it. You've got to repent,
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.120]   you've got to confess your sins, you've got to realise the truth about yourself,
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.880]   you've got to try and keep God's law, you've got to try and honour his commandments,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:35.920]   that's all I'm asking you.' 'I can't deliver you,' says John, 'but he will deliver you. I can simply
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:41.920]   tell you what's wrong, he alone can put it right. I am not the deliverer, I am not the Christ,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:51.840]   I am unworthy to undo the lack of the issue.' So let we see that John the Baptist teaches
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   us very plainly and clearly, that merely to be moral and merely to be religious doesn't save us,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:05.760]   it doesn't give us Christianity. The Jews thought it saved them, but Christ says, 'These things I
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.560]   say unto you, that you might be saved. Listen to what John said to you, he said that this
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:16.480]   isn't Christianity, that this isn't salvation, that God will never be satisfied with that alone.'
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:27.600]   Have you confused, I wonder, my friend, between the baptism of John and the baptism of Christ?
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:34.000]   Had you thought that the Christian is just a good, moral, decent, clean living man,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.840]   and no more? If you did, you don't know anything about Christianity. That's baptism with water,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.240]   that's John, that's preliminary, that simply points to the greatness and the glory of the
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.440]   true salvation that Christ alone can give. What is it? Well, let's look at it. Here is
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:58.400]   Christ's baptism, this baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire. What is it? Well, it's a
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:05.680]   large subject, I can only touch upon it. There's been a great deal of confusion about this,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.680]   and many people are frightened of it because certain misguided people have put into the
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.960]   center what belongs to the periphery, and have regarded the incidentals which may or
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:27.120]   may not be present as the most important thing of all. But what does it mean then,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:37.600]   sir Solomon? Well, let me tell you very briefly. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:46.320]   The fire is in the Holy Ghost. What does it mean? It means this. This is Christ's salvation. He's
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.600]   already died for the penalty and the guilt of sin. But oh, what about these other aspects? Here it
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.560]   is. He baptizes with the Holy Ghost and fire. What does this mean? Well, you see the contrast,
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.360]   don't you? It's no longer water. It's the difference between water and fire. That's
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:08.080]   the difference between morality and Christianity. How cold is morality, how correct, and yet not
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:14.720]   only that, but external, superficial. But fire, the heat, the warmth, the power, and more than
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.080]   that, it's internal, it works within, and this is the whole doctrine of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:30.000]   What the Lord Jesus Christ does is not merely to clean us on the surface as water does.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:42.480]   He works within, and he works within with the fire of the Holy Ghost, and fire purifies.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.280]   There is nothing that purifies us, fire does.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:54.320]   Do you see that mess of amalgam? There's gold in it, but there are other things in it. And what
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:59.600]   you do with it, you put it into the crucible, and outside the crucible is the mighty flame of fire.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:05.760]   And what does it do? It burns and consumes the dust, and nothing is left but the pure gold.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:13.760]   That's how you purify metals, by fire. And the Holy Ghost is fire, and he works within,
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:20.960]   and he purifies, and he cleanses the heart. It isn't merely, I say, an external action,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:27.120]   it is an internal action. He not merely gets rid of this defilement of sin,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.280]   he deals with the source of sin in the heart itself. It's the answer to the cry and the
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:41.760]   prayer of David in Psalm 51, "Create within me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:49.440]   within me." And Christ sends the Spirit, and he burns as a fire within, purifying and cleansing.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:59.200]   The Apostle Paul puts it in his way in writing to the Philippians in the second chapter, when he
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:09.360]   says this, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.960]   both the will and to do of his good pleasure." What's he mean? It's a reference to the work of
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:23.680]   the Holy Ghost. In sanctifying us and in cleansing us, he's within us, and he directs our minds and
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.040]   our thoughts and our imaginations. You suddenly feel you must read the Word of God, and it gives
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:34.160]   you a message. What made you feel that? It was the Holy Ghost. It's a part of his burning. He leads
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.560]   you to the truth which burns and sanctifies. You suddenly feel you must pray, you have a longing
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.960]   for God. What is it? It's the Holy Ghost leading you to sanctification, burning away the dust.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:53.200]   It is he that enlightens our minds and our understanding to the world and its way,
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.920]   and without the enlightening we'll never see it. We think the world is wonderful by nature,
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.520]   but the Holy Ghost enlightens us, and we mere men to hate sin.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:10.080]   Oh, let me give it in one great quotation again from the Apostle Paul in his first epistle to
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:16.480]   the Corinthians in chapter 6, beginning at verse 9, "Know ye not that the unrighteous
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:23.840]   shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.320]   nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, sodomites;
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:39.360]   nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:45.200]   nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you;
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.560]   but he hath washed, but he hath sanctified, but he hath justified in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.840]   and by the Spirit of our God." The Holy Spirit had been in them and had burned,
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:01.040]   and had burned away the vileness, and the foulness, and the evil, and their faints
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:11.600]   adorning the church of God. No longer water, but fire. Oh yes, and another thing.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:18.480]   The Holy Ghost brings to us the new covenant that God had promised through Jeremiah that he would
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.000]   make with the people. Do you remember what it was? Let me remind you. "I will put my law into their
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.080]   mind, and write them in their hearts; and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:36.400]   man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:44.960]   You see the difference? The old covenant, John, was a commandment written on a table, on a slate,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:52.320]   on a stone. It was outside. There it is, there's the old tables of covenant, a law outside me.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:58.560]   Oh, says God through Jeremiah, when he comes and sheds forth the Holy Spirit, it'll be my new
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:06.640]   covenant. I'm going to write the laws in their mind, imprint them in their hearts, so that a man
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.480]   no longer will be looking at something outside himself. He'll have my law inside him. It'll be
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:18.640]   working as a power within him, delivering him, setting him free, making known the truth to him.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.960]   Christ said it when he said, "If ye continue in my words, then are ye my disciples indeed;
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.080]   and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:37.200]   If the Son will make you free, ye shall be free indeed. Whosoever commits sin is the servant of
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:46.320]   sin. But if the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. This is what the Holy Ghost does.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:52.400]   He comes within us as a purifying flame, and he leads us to this delight in holiness,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:42:03.200]   and in truth, and in God, and in sanctification. And so he delivers us from the power of sin,
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:11.440]   and from its pollution. You needn't be a Christian to be moral,
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:20.720]   but you must be a Christian to be holy. Morality simply doesn't do things. That isn't Christianity.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:27.840]   Christianity is a love of purity, and holiness, and truth, and sanctity, because it's God. And
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:33.280]   it's within him as a principle, and as a power, and as a fire, burning away dross,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.160]   calling into that which is true, and noble, and upright. He baptizes with the Holy Ghost,
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:47.440]   and with fire. And then another thing he does, of course, is to give certainty and joy.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:56.160]   Don't you see that so plainly and clearly in those very apostles?
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:08.480]   Look at them after the crucifixion, meeting together. And Peter, the bold, impulsive Peter,
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.680]   turning to the others and said, "I'm going to fish."
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:18.640]   "He's gone, we are disappointed. All the end has come. I go fishing."
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:23.520]   The others said, "We are coming with you." And out they went and fished all night and caught nothing.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.200]   And then as the dawn was breaking, they happened to look at the shore, and there they saw someone.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:42.080]   And it was the Lord. Oh, how miserable, how wretched, how questful, and how powerless these
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:48.560]   men were. But then look at Peter under their pentagon, standing up and defying the world,
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.000]   the man who denied his own Lord and Savior in order to shave his skin, who had denied to the
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.800]   maid, the serving maid, and said, "I don't know him." And he denied him with oaths and cursing.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.320]   But here he is defying the whole world. What is this? Oh, it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:10.560]   He's got certainty, he's got knowledge, he's filled with joy, and he says, "We cannot but speak
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.640]   of the things which we have seen and have heard." Christianity doesn't mean that a man is hoping
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.680]   that some hour or another, or some time or another, his sins are going to be forgiven,
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:27.040]   and he may get into heaven at the end. No, no. The Christian, the man with the Holy Ghost in him,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.080]   is a man who knows in whom he has believed, and he is persuaded that he will keep that
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:39.760]   which I have committed unto him against that day. The baptism with the Holy Ghost makes a man know
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:47.040]   that his sins are forgiven, that he is a child of God. He says, "The Spirit testifies with my spirit
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:59.840]   that I am a child of God." The great trouble in the world today, and the great trouble in the church,
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:08.560]   is that there are so many people who don't know. They're uncertain, they're miserable.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.120]   They know enough about Christianity to spoil the world for them, but they haven't got joy.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.240]   They're unlike these disciples, they're unlike the first Christians.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:26.080]   And it is because they've never realized the truth of the message of John the Baptist,
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:32.720]   that Christ baptizes with the Holy Ghost and with fire, and does to us what he did to the apostles
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:38.000]   and to those first Christians in Samaria, to Cornelius and his household, and to those people
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:49.120]   in Ephesus. He gives certainty, he gives joy, and he gives power.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:58.240]   He comes into us as a power in our lives that amazes us, and we don't know ourselves.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:08.560]   His power delivers us from the crawldom of sin, its power, its dominion, and its pollution.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:19.680]   He gives us power to testify unto this, as he gave it there to Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:32.640]   He gives us power to endure all things, whatever they may be. I, says the apostle Paul,
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:43.760]   can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. I know both how to be abased
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:53.600]   and how to abound. You can do nothing to me, says the apostle Paul, which will in any way disturb me.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.400]   You can throw me into prison, you can starve me, it doesn't make any difference.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:09.680]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. That's the power of the Holy
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:16.560]   Ghost within. That's this baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire. It's the knowledge that he
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:22.160]   is right with Christ. He knows him, and nothing can ever separate him from him. He's secure,
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.920]   his everlasting destiny is safe. Men may destroy the body, but they can't touch the soul and the
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:36.560]   spirit. So he has power to endure all things. He can defy the world, he can look at hydrogen bomb,
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.520]   and he can say, "Let them come, it doesn't make any difference finally to me." It can ruin and
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:49.280]   blast the world to nothing. But my inheritance is safe with God and with Christ, and I am so.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:56.160]   He's conquered the world. He is greater than the power of hell,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:07.120]   simply because of the power of the Holy Spirit of God, which has been shed abroad in his heart.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:15.840]   I, the Christ, says John the Baptist, I indeed baptize you with water.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:22.480]   Poor John the Baptist, the greatest amongst the sons of women, and yet you remember that later
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:28.400]   on in his story, he was thrown into prison for six months, and poor John languishing in the prison,
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.880]   he began to doubt. And he sent his two disciples to Jesus Christ, and he said,
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:39.600]   "Are so ye that should come, or do we look for another?" Poor John, he hadn't been baptized
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.040]   himself with the Holy Ghost. All he knew was that Christ was going to do it. He hadn't received it.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:52.160]   And therefore he broke down under the imprisonment and the suffering, and all the doubts came in.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:49:01.040]   But that didn't happen to the apostle Paul, who had exactly the same treatment and worth.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:06.080]   Why? Well, because he had been given this certainty, this joy,
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.960]   this assurance, and this power which this baptism of the Holy Ghost gives.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   John pointed to him. He said, "This isn't it. He's got it, and he is going to give it.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:29.200]   He is the Lamb of God. Just take it away, the sins of the world. He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.880]   He is risen again and has sent forth the Holy Ghost, and by the power of the Holy Ghost,
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:40.560]   we can be delivered from the power of sin, the pollution of sin, and from everything set against
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:52.800]   us. We become in this world the children of God, and the heirs of God, and the joint heirs of Christ.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:50:02.960]   And we can know that now. We can rejoice in the knowledge. We can laugh in the face of the world,
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:10.480]   at its most pleasant, at its most ugly. We can be sorry for the poor people in London this evening,
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.920]   who are spending their money pound after pound, trying to find a pleasure that they never get.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.600]   We can be sorry for them. We pray for them. It's because of their ignorance.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.960]   They don't know the blessings and the joys that come in Christ through the Holy Spirit.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:36.880]   And should a third world war come, and these horrible powers be unleashed,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:45.280]   our world will not collapse. For we know that this world is already doomed,
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:56.800]   but our citizenship is already in heaven, from whence also we expect to save it.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:02.480]   My dear friend, do you know anything about this baptism with the Holy Ghost and power?
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:08.240]   Are you still struggling to be moral? You needn't be a Christian to do that, I say.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.920]   Have you something more? Are you aware of the power within you? It is what is offered by Christ.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:22.240]   He doesn't merely die to save us from hell. He dies to deliver us from the dominion of sin and
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:32.400]   of sin, and to present us falsehoods before the presence of God at last. I indeed baptize you
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:42.160]   with water. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with power. Are you beginning to
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:48.000]   experience the deliverance, the liberty, the glorious liberty of the children of God?
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.160]   Oh, I say, go to him, ask him for it, beseech him for it, cry out unto him for it. You are meant to
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:01.120]   be more than conqueror over everything that meets you, over everything that assails you. Ask him
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:12.960]   for it, for he has said himself, "Ask, and he shall receive. Seek, and he shall find. Knock,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:20.000]   and it shall be opened unto you. If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.400]   children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:35.840]   him? Ask him for it. Ask him in the name of Christ, and you shall receive and begin to experience
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.640]   the glorious deliverance. Amen.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:47.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
