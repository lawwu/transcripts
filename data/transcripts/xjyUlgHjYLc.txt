[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Hi, Carl.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.020]   I'm Rhiann, I'm a data scientist in the UK.
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.120]   And I'm trying to work out how you can apply techniques
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.840]   such as time blocking and deep work to a broader team level,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.840]   especially when you've got lots and lots of projects
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.320]   and you're trying to understand,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.760]   can I take on this new work
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.720]   or who can I allocate onto a specific project?
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.480]   So sort of quarterly and annual project planning.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.680]   And I'm less thinking about tools
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.960]   'cause everyone's throwing different management tools at me,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.040]   but what I'm interested in is the process.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.680]   So what processes would you follow?
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.360]   Thanks.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.720]   - Well, it's a critical question
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   because most teams do not actually try to inquire
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.740]   about what's on people's plates.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.700]   Is it too much?
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.540]   Is it too little?
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.640]   Who has room for something?
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.320]   We largely ignore that.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.480]   We largely deploy, and I'm using the royal we here
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.480]   to refer to knowledge work managers in general,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.720]   but we largely deploy a push-based system,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.480]   which is basically push things onto people
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.620]   that need to be handled, that you don't want on your plate,
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.600]   trust them to basically regulate their own workload.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.680]   And maybe at some point they'll say,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.260]   "I don't know, I have too much,"
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.240]   and navigate that social minefield.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.900]   That's largely how we actually assign work right now.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.400]   In knowledge work, I think it's a problem.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.980]   I wrote a column about this for the New Yorker
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.100]   a couple months ago that was called,
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.380]   "Why do we work too much?"
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.940]   Now, you really get into the problems
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.000]   with this push-based model.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.040]   It almost inevitably leads to overwork.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.220]   You basically say yes
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.080]   because it's socially difficult to say yes,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.140]   and it's hard to keep track
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.380]   of what's on your individual plate.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.640]   You keep saying yes until the pain gets high enough
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.540]   that in frustration and desperation, you say, "Uncle."
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.900]   And the result is everyone ends up
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.820]   with about 20% too much on their plate.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.360]   So what you are suggesting here is a solution.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.300]   Let us as a team keep track of who's working on what
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.600]   so we can confront that transparently
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.500]   and see what the reality is.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.860]   I can't push this onto your plate
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.260]   if I see you have a lot of things on your plate,
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.620]   or if I do, I have to confront what I'm doing.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.980]   I am now putting a ridiculous amount of stuff on your plate.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.780]   You know, you are putting the onus onto the team
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.380]   and away from the individual to do work allocation.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.420]   I think this is a critical shift in thinking.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.180]   So how do you actually do this from a process perspective?
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.820]   I think you can take some ideas from software development.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.740]   In software development,
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.280]   when they deploy agile type processes,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   they have the things that are ongoing on a card somewhere,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.300]   and they can see their statuses.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.540]   Okay, this thing is being worked on,
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.460]   and here's who's working on it.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.780]   And if you're using an agile methodology like Kanban,
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.020]   they have an explicit what's known as work in progress limit
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.940]   for each individual.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.000]   They're just very clear about this.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.740]   I don't want anyone working on more than two things
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.620]   at a time or more than one thing at a time.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.180]   What's the thing that person's working on?
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.020]   Great, we see it.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.300]   They're working on something.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.660]   When they're done,
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.660]   we can then figure out what to give them next.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.940]   And this decision can be made transparently
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.340]   and with all the relevant information.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.220]   Okay, you're done with this.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.460]   Here's the next thing for you to work on.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.060]   And if you say, well,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180]   we have too many things to get done here,
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.160]   and it's not all getting done in time,
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.440]   you have to confront the reality
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.720]   that you're generating too much work.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.240]   Because here is the load.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   People have these slots.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.560]   They could be working on one or two things at a time.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.480]   If you have way too many things that have to be assigned
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.920]   and you can't get it to people in time,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.500]   then maybe there's too much work actually going on,
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.340]   but you have to confront that reality.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.680]   So I call this alternative that you're talking about here
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.760]   a pull-based approach.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.400]   You're basically having the individuals
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.080]   pull onto their plate the next thing they're gonna work on
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.040]   from a large pool of potential things.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.680]   And this pool pulling process,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.840]   pulling from the pool, this is like a vocal exercise.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.880]   This pulling process is something that can be done
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.160]   with involvement of you,
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.320]   with involvement of the whole team.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.280]   It can be done with some foresight and intelligence.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.600]   Of all the things we have that need to be done right now,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.560]   what's the best thing for you to be working on next?
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.800]   So it's less haphazard and more thoughtful
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.240]   about what people work on.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.520]   So from a process perspective, that's what I would say.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.080]   Separate where you're keeping track
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.840]   of what needs to be done.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.000]   Have a place for that that is common for the entire team.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.560]   Do not just distribute these things haphazardly
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.800]   onto people's individual plates
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.080]   and just ask them how are things going.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.160]   Two, have some sort of systematic way for figuring out
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.960]   what should this person work on next?
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.440]   What should that person work on next?
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.880]   If they have a very limited number of things
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.160]   on their plate at a time,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.760]   your expectations and standards
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.060]   for them executing those things is quite high.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.720]   But as they finish, you say, okay, what comes up next?
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.440]   And probably what you need here is a once a day
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.000]   or twice a day highly structured status meeting.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.720]   We're looking at whatever tool we're using
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.960]   to see who's working on what
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.900]   and the pool of things that need to be done.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.920]   What are you working on today?
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.000]   What's your status?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.280]   What are you committing to getting done?
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.720]   What do you need from other people to get that done?
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.040]   Great, go rock and roll.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.560]   We'll check in at the next very quick,
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.600]   very structured status meeting.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.080]   Now you're done with that.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.120]   Why don't you work on this?
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.280]   What do you need to get this done?
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.440]   You need that from Bob and that from Allison.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.800]   Great, you guys are on the call.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.280]   Make sure he has that within the next 30 minutes.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.760]   We'll check back in at the next status meeting,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   probably something like that.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.720]   So an external tool to keep track of everything
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.820]   that needs to be done and a highly structured set routine
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.980]   for how you figure out what someone finishes something,
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.820]   what comes next.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.680]   That's a shift from the push method of just,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.800]   let's throw this stuff on people's plate
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.380]   to the pull method of let's figure out together.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.560]   What's the next thing for you to do now that you're finished?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.220]   I think these types of transitions
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.760]   and how we think about work is critical.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.600]   You get more out of the human brain,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.120]   you get a lot less burnout.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.240]   It's a much better way to work.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   So I'm glad you asked this question.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.060]   Any type of implementation along the lines
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.800]   I'm talking about there is going to be exponentially better
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.400]   than the standard thing that we do,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.120]   which is, my God, I just thought of something.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.440]   It stresses me out that it's on my mind.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.680]   Type, type, type, type, type, type, type.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.760]   Hey, can you handle this send?
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.200]   Boom, it's off my mind, yay.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.000]   We just do that dozens and dozens of times
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.200]   until everyone's exhausted.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   So good for you for thinking about this.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.360]   Hopefully those general approaches
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.960]   will help you make that vision
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.020]   of pull, not push more concrete.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.760]   (upbeat music)
