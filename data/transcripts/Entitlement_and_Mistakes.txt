[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.160]   And in this episode, I want to talk about the biggest financial mistakes you can ever
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.360]   make and also sign up for my newsletter.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.620]   It's a free weekly newsletter at FinancialSamurai.com/news.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.980]   So on to the topic of biggest financial mistakes.
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.120]   The first rule of financial independence is to not lose money.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.520]   If you lose lots of money, you are ultimately losing valuable time.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.480]   And when we only have so much to live, losing time is the biggest financial mistake you
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.800]   can make because it's the most valuable asset.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.120]   I hope you agree this makes absolute sense, which is why we listen to financial podcasts,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.800]   we read books, we try to listen and get educated about our finances.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.820]   And we have a risk appropriate asset allocation framework.
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.800]   We cannot risk losing so much money that we end up going backwards.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.200]   In true Fight Club fashion, I could say the second rule of financial independence is to
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.640]   never forget the first rule.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.380]   However, the second rule, the real second rule is to never expect your income to always
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.560]   go up.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.760]   That would be your second biggest financial mistake you could ever make.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.340]   Life is not a straight line.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.200]   Bad things happen all the time.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.020]   If it's not a pandemic that crushes your income, it might be a bear market that takes your
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.940]   net worth down 20%.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.720]   And if it's not a bear market that leaves you jobless, it might be a health issue that
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.840]   prevents you from working.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   People over 40 don't need to be told that life is both wonderful and difficult.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.500]   For all of you still relatively early on your financial journey, please take heed.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.500]   Listen to your elders.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.500]   I'm 45.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.160]   So if you're younger than me, and you want to go where I've been, well, it might be a
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.600]   good idea to listen to what I have to say, because I share with you both the good and
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   the bad.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.120]   I don't want you to be full of regrets, because you didn't know the risks.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.560]   Back in 2007, at the time I made the most amount of money in my career.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   I had gotten recently promoted to vice president and thought I was on top of the world.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.160]   In my spreadsheet to calculate my future net worth growth, I estimated I would conservatively
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.840]   make 10% more annually for the next five years.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   I mean, why not?
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   It was a bull market.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.120]   2007 was crazy times, just like 2000.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.620]   When you're flush with cash and have a promising career, and you believe in the importance
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.960]   of spending your money to enjoy your life, why not reward yourself?
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   That's what I did.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.800]   I bought a two bedroom, two bath condo in Lake Tao for $715,000.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   This is in 2007.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.000]   That was right before the financial crisis.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.480]   I thought it was a good deal, because condos of similar size sold previously at $810,000
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.840]   a year before, but then of course, everything went to hell.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   The S&P 500 crashed by 38.5%.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.480]   The housing market collapsed.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.420]   My income got slashed by 50%.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.560]   And within a couple of years, my condo's value plummeted from $715,000 to under $500,000.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.640]   It might have gone under $400,000 at the worst of the cycle, but I didn't pay that close
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.960]   attention because it was too depressing.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.120]   Investors were conducting short sales left and right, dragging all of us fools who kept
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.800]   on paying our mortgages down with them.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.880]   And I say fool in a loving way, because I do believe it is the honorable thing to fulfill
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.120]   the promises of your contract.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.280]   And the silver lining is today that condo is paid off.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.400]   I finally paid it off in 2022, and I'm bringing my kids up there.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.440]   But man, every time I went up to the condo, I was reminded about my financial mistake
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.200]   for 15 years.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.960]   And I'm still going to be reminded.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.520]   Thankfully, the condo as a percentage of my net worth is much, much smaller than it was
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.640]   in 2007.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.960]   If only I had avoided the financial mistake of income extrapolation, I would be at least
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.000]   $300,000 richer, maybe $500,000 richer based on the money I could have reinvested in the
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.240]   stock market and in real estate.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.320]   Please keep your income expectations conservative.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.200]   If you do not, you may end up buying things beyond what you're capable of affording.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.120]   The main reason why I'm recording this podcast on financial independence rules is because
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   of the New York Times strike.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.760]   For over 24 years, I wasn't really paying attention to how other folks make money.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.480]   The first world of income expectations is based on a meritocracy.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.840]   The better you do at your job, the more you tend to get paid.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.920]   If you stink it up, then your pay will rightly be less.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.400]   If you feel you aren't getting paid what you're worth, you'll leave.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   You'll rationally send out resumes to try to find a better job that will pay you more.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.520]   Now, the second world of income expectations is based on always getting paid more, no matter
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   what.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.600]   The economy may be in a recession.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.200]   We might be in a bear market.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.560]   Your company's stock might be in the toilet.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.240]   A nuclear bomb may have detonated.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.120]   Yet you still think you deserve to get paid more, guaranteed, every year.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.840]   Well, this second view of getting paid violates the second rule of financial independence.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.080]   Having this entitlement mindset of always getting paid more is dangerous.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.360]   Based on my realization of how journalists get paid at the New York Times and other places,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.040]   I understand why they're striking.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.120]   We all want to get paid more.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   Inflation is high.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.280]   Hopefully, our salaries can keep up with or beat inflation rates because that way we can
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.600]   get ahead.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.560]   But this type of expectation for always getting more is very dangerous.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.240]   Here are a couple of examples of entitlement and how it can hurt your wealth and happiness.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.800]   Let's say in high school or let's say college, you study on average one hour for your final
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.680]   exam while all your peers study for three, four, seven hours.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.960]   And so as a result, you get a B but your peers get an A because there's a bell curve.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.880]   And then you get pissed off because employers reject you for not having a 3.75 GPA or above.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.320]   I remember back at Goldman Sachs, the minimum GPA cutoff was 3.7.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.000]   Now you're rejected and you start questioning why life isn't fair.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.920]   And then you end up lonely and spiteful and you hate on anybody who has more than you.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.840]   That's terrible, right?
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.960]   And then let's say three years out of college, you expect to go to the corner office.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.200]   You haven't put in your dues.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.540]   The average CEO has worked for 25 years to be able to become CEO.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.920]   And so you get passed over for a promotion and you start bad mouthing your colleagues.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.360]   And then you start undermining your boss.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.720]   You start thinking to yourself, "Do you know who I am?
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.200]   I come from this prominent family.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.720]   I went to this fancy school.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.320]   You should feel gratitude that I'm even working for you."
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.960]   That type of mentality is like a virus.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   Nobody likes that.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.620]   And as a result, your career trajectory derails.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.840]   And speaking of viruses, I wrote a post before that talks about how to get revenge from an
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.600]   employer who let you go or passed you over.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.400]   And one way is to actually implant a recommended virus to that employer.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.880]   So in other words, let's say you hate your employer because they lied to you and wronged
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   you.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.840]   Well, you recommend some employee who has a terrible attitude, full of entitlement,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.360]   spreads gossip, undermines bosses, and you say, "Hey, this is a great employee.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.640]   Go ahead, hire them.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   They'll do great."
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.600]   And what happens is the virus eats the company from within and blows it up.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.640]   We know 2022 is a terrible year.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.520]   We've had a recession and a bear market.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   With the way the Fed is raising rates, hopefully not to 5% terminal, we're likely going to
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.280]   have another recession in 2023.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.000]   Therefore, maybe a million jobs will be lost over the next one or two years.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.560]   Wall Street strategists expect no gains for 2023 in the S&P 500.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.320]   The housing market is not looking too good because mortgage rates are so high.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.700]   Further, the New York Times stock price is at a three-year low.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:35.600]   So perhaps expecting a guaranteed 5.25% annual raise over the next four or five years while
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:43.520]   the industry is struggling and while inflation is heading down is illogical and perhaps dangerous.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.680]   Plenty of people in the media are losing their jobs.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.220]   Instead of striking, maybe it would be more rational to revert to 2019 level pay given
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.960]   the New York Times stock price is back to 2019 levels.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.360]   Now I know people are going to be angry, especially journalists who are listening to this, and
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.160]   I don't mean to be cruel.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.120]   I'm just trying to help everyone think about the mindset of not always expecting to get
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.720]   paid more and more, even in bad times.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.900]   Here's the thing.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:18.040]   It's important to feel fear, to have your back against the wall when you look down,
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.720]   there's no safety net.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.820]   Because when there is no safety net, you need to survive.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:29.080]   You will do everything possible in your power to make more money, side hustle, save more,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.040]   invest more, budget more, and so forth.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.560]   The sooner you can better align your expectations with the current realities of the world, the
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.080]   sooner you can make optimal financial decisions.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.720]   Just because you are a certain race or work at a certain prestigious organization or went
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.920]   to some elite university doesn't mean you automatically deserve to make more.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.320]   You deserve to make more when you do great work and when the economic conditions are
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   right.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.920]   There's a great saying, "Nothing is given, everything is earned."
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.500]   This is a very powerful mindset to have.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.040]   The best situation for wealth building is to have that guaranteed pay race every single
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.860]   year for years and years and years, while also adopting the mindset of nothing is given
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.460]   and everything is earned, pretending you have no guarantees, no safety net.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.440]   This way, you have this one-two punch where you have security, but you're hustling because
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.920]   you're pretending you don't have the security.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.260]   As a result, I think you'll end up building way more wealth.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.360]   After making one of the biggest financial mistakes at age 30, I had to suffer for the
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.320]   next 15 years with the consequences of overpaying.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.360]   Here's what I did do.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   I learned to never expect my income to always go up again.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.300]   I developed a strong money mindset that nobody was going to save me.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.840]   As soon as I stopped expecting to always get paid and promoted, I began doing everything
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.260]   I could to generate alternative income streams.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.840]   Real estate became my salvation.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.720]   I sucked up the pain of managing property because I knew it was my main way to get free
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   from working forever.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:13.000]   Instead of only modeling, let's say, realistic or blue sky scenarios in my retirement planning
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.400]   model, I introduced dark sky scenarios by talking about bear markets, what would happen
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.600]   if I got let go, just realistically bad things that tend to happen to everyone.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.840]   By doing so, I forced myself to always be aware of downside risks.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.960]   With such awareness, I maintained an elevated saving rate and ensured I had risk-appropriate
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.680]   asset allocation.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:43.240]   Stopping 80% of my net worth in cryptocurrency, NFTs, or SPACs was never going to happen because
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.080]   I was aware of dark sky scenarios.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   Very important.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.680]   And when you know your pay is highly volatile and it goes up and down with the economy and
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:58.320]   your performance, you tend to not splurge on things you probably shouldn't buy.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:06.280]   For example, I kept my $8,000 Land Rover Discovery 2 for 10 years until it was worth about $2,000.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.960]   And then I traded it in for a Honda Fit that cost about $20,000 and I drove that for three
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.120]   years.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   That was actually a luxury splurge at the time, a brand new car, but I leased it for
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120]   my business.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.760]   It was like $245 a month, not that big of a deal.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.040]   But I used the $80,000 I wanted to spend on a new car in 2005 and invested it in the S&P
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   500.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.400]   And as a result, that $80,000 is worth over $200,000 now.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:39.240]   And because I realized bear markets happen every seven to 10 years, I decided to keep
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.480]   financial samurai going without fail.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.800]   Three posts a week for 10 years is not easy, but it was a promise I made in 2009 because
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.520]   I expected good things to happen if I stayed consistent.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.400]   I knew that if all my investments failed, at least I would have a financial samurai
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.220]   spitting out some pennies.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:03.400]   So in conclusion, I say expect nothing and get richer as a result.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:10.240]   I remember talking to my dad maybe 10 years ago and I asked him why he didn't save more,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   more money.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.040]   I mean, he was doing fine, but it was just one of those personal finance conversations.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   And he said, "Well, I had a pension.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.880]   I had a government pension, so there was no real need to aggressively save as much as
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.560]   you're talking about, dear son."
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.240]   Because for me, in the FIRE community, we talk about saving at least 20% of our after
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.980]   tax income after contributing the maximum to our tax advantage accounts.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.280]   And then I started talking about trying to shoot for a 50% after tax rate, right?
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.660]   Every year you save 50%, you buy one year of freedom.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.860]   It's easy math.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.860]   But I think to most people, that seems a little nuts.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.700]   And what I realized was that my dad's actions were completely rational.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.380]   The US government wasn't going to go under.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.540]   If my dad paid off all his debts, which he did by the time he retired and lived a frugal
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:04.580]   life, the pension would be more than enough to pay for his lifestyle, his desired lifestyle.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:11.140]   However, if you do not work for the government, if you work for a private sector company,
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:17.620]   you work in the private sector, be aware that executives have a duty to shareholders, public
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:23.280]   shareholders to try to outperform the market or to get that stock up.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.860]   But just as employees have a right to fight for more compensation, executives have a fiduciary
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.340]   responsibility to their shareholders.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.780]   So just be careful.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:39.740]   If you argue too loudly in a tough economic environment, when there's layoffs and a terrible
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.820]   stock price that you deserve to get paid more and more every year for years and years and
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.860]   years, you might be putting yourself at risk.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.180]   And absolutely, there is strength in numbers with the union.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:57.140]   But as we see industry ride in the media and in other sectors, people are getting let go
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.780]   because industries go through these down cycles and then they go through these up cycles.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.700]   It's just the way the economy is.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.260]   It's capitalism and we have to figure out how to deal with that.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:13.380]   And I say the best way to deal with that is by not relying on anybody to have low expectations,
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:19.700]   to have no expectations except for the expectations of yourself to work hard and to figure out
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:25.540]   how to become anti fragile and build your net worth and passive income streams.
