[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   Well, it's the polar opposite of Christ. And it's the polar opposite of the holy life.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.580]   Selfishness. Selfishness, Spurgeon once said, is as foreign to Christianity as darkness
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.680]   to light. The darkness of self-centeredness is the opposite of Christ, his gospel, and
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.880]   it undermines every aim in the Christian life. Self-defeating selfishness is still in us.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.080]   We want to shed it. We must fight it. And that leads to today's email. Pastor John,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.040]   I need your help in overcoming my selfishness. I'm a 17-year-old male. People around me,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.080]   people I love, and people who love me, especially my girlfriend, keep saying that I am selfish.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.680]   I want to become selfless. The problem keeps coming back when I think I'm doing a good
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.920]   job being selfless. I'm sure I'm unwilling and just don't want to admit it. How can I
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360]   learn to become a selfless young man?
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.400]   Well, not knowing you personally makes it a little bit awkward to give specific counsel.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.240]   So I think the first thing I really should say is that it would be probably wise for
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.680]   you to seek out a mature Christian outside that circle that you're talking about, perhaps
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.960]   your pastor or youth leader, and share with them some of the specifics of what people
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.940]   are saying that puzzle you, and get their insight into your heart as they know you personally.
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.080]   Keep in mind that the Apostle Paul said, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.880]   and admonishing one another in all wisdom." That's what you want. You want someone who's
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   rich in biblical wisdom, who is full of the word of Christ, who can admonish you close
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.320]   at hand. That's what I can't do. I have to speak from a distance in generalities. You
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.260]   need somebody who knows you, full of biblical wisdom, full of courage to speak the truth.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.320]   So that's my first counsel. But let me try to say some general things that I hope might
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:35.120]   help. Selfishness is a many-headed monster. It is, in a sense, the most destructive disease
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.200]   of the human soul. Absolutely nobody on this planet except for Jesus escapes the disease
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.240]   of selfishness. The heads of this monster are infinitely diverse. And I know that the
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.320]   word infinitely is an overstatement. I know that. But the point is, the variety of manifestations
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.800]   of selfishness are endless in this life. You cut off one head and another grows up. You
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   might be a couch potato that is always expecting others to serve you your pizza, or you might
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.120]   be endlessly serving couch potatoes, deeply desiring that they make much of you for your
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:31.040]   service. You might be the most prayerful person in your group, and you may have never confessed
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.240]   personal sin in your public prayers in that group and ask for forgiveness because you
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.160]   don't want to reveal that part about yourself. You may call continual attention to the injustices
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.840]   of the world and how others are being mistreated, but others can tell by looking at you that
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   there's a good deal of virtue signaling going on there as you show how discerning you are
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.560]   and how morally upright you are, that you can spot such injustices. There's just no
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:12.160]   end of the subtleties of selfishness in all of us, not just a 17-year-old struggling with
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.400]   his own heart. We must fight this monster on two fronts. Both are biblical, and the
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.320]   second is dominant. It should be dominant, let's say. The first is, but the first is
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:35.080]   good, necessary. The first is face the monster, stare it down, own it, be brokenhearted by
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.160]   it, hate it, declare war on it, kill it. That's what Paul meant in Colossians 3, 5 when he
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.600]   said, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you." And one of the things he mentions
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:59.120]   is evil desire, like selfishness. That would include praying against it, spotting its first
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.480]   signs and resisting them, claiming your new position of acceptance and justification in
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.880]   Christ and saying, "I am a new creation. This ugly monster is not who I am. That's
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:21.280]   not my true identity," and then renouncing the temptation as alien to your soul, which
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.400]   is, which it is, it is alien to your soul in Christ Jesus. Now, that's the first front,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.120]   that direct assailing, negative, killing fight that we must take up every day because that's
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:42.680]   what the Bible says we should do. The second front that we fight on is filling our minds
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:53.120]   and hearts with so much of Christ that the selfish impulses are defeated by being suffocated.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   They don't have room in your heart. They can't breathe there. There's too much Christ.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:09.080]   They die, not mainly because of a direct attack, but because something has taken their place,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:20.720]   namely humble, thankful love for Christ. So the analogy is a jar full of toxic fumes.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:28.040]   Now, what would be the best way to get those fumes out of the jar? And you could attack
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:37.360]   them directly by attaching a vacuum and sucking them out, or more simply, more effectively,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:48.320]   you could pour fresh, clean water into the jar and force all the toxic fumes out by replacing
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   them. This is how sins are overcome most effectively. Our soul is the jar, selfishness is the toxic
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:09.160]   fumes, and Christ is the water that pushes it out. Specifically, Christ experienced in
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.720]   our knowledge of Christ, in our love for Christ, in our trust in Christ, experienced Christ
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:23.160]   present, reigning, ruling, taking up residence in our lives fully in fellowship. In other
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:31.200]   words, the best way to fight selfishness is not to think about selfishness, but to think
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:40.760]   about Christ and specifically to think about what a great savior he is, what a great counselor
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:52.600]   he is, a great friend, a great Lord, sustainer, champion. If our lives, our minds, our hearts
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:01.440]   are overflowing with wonder at the greatness and the beauty and the worth of Christ and
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:09.120]   the immeasurable value of what he's done for us, it is not likely that we will be perceived
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:18.920]   as selfish. Selfish people are preoccupied with themselves and not with Christ. They
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:27.600]   have a longing that they be recognized, made much of, focused on, instead of Christ being
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:37.640]   recognized, made much of, focused on. This is a matter of authentic, heartfelt emotion.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:46.960]   You can't produce this like a show. The goal is to feel, truly feel the preciousness of
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.800]   Christ. That's the goal. It has to be real. This is what Paul meant when he said, "I count
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:01.600]   everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." That's
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.000]   the key. That was not a show for Paul. He wasn't putting on airs. He was expressing
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.960]   the deepest affections of his heart. I love Jesus Christ more than anything.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:26.040]   So the strategy for overcoming selfishness is Hebrews 3.1. Consider Jesus, the apostle
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:34.920]   and high priest of our confession. Or Hebrews 12.3. Consider him who endured for sinners
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:43.560]   such hostility against himself. This is the work of a lifetime, not the work of a moment.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:52.160]   Every day, focusing our mind's attention and our heart's affection on Christ and the kind
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:01.880]   of person he is and the greatness of the work that he has done. I think Jesus had the danger
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:09.600]   of selfishness in mind when he told his disciples who had just experienced great victories over
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:18.240]   Satan that they should not rejoice in this, but that their names are written in heaven.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:29.640]   Luke 10.20. In other words, it's more effective in overcoming sin that we be amazed that we're
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:40.600]   saved than that we're successful, even successful by God's power. You would think ministry success
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:49.280]   is a good thing to rejoice in, but Jesus says it's even more important to rejoice that you
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:56.360]   know Christ, rejoice that you have a relationship with Jesus, that you spend time with him now
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:02.880]   and you will spend eternity with him later. And let me say one more thing quickly before
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.960]   we stop. Since Jesus said to love our neighbor as we love ourselves, it's clear that Jesus
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:17.840]   acknowledges there is a proper self-love. This is not self-esteem. This is doing what
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:24.800]   will bring infinite and eternal joy to your own soul. That's self-love. Doing what will
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:31.000]   bring infinite and eternal joy to your own soul. And that's what Jesus offers us. And
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.040]   then Jesus makes our desire for our own eternal happiness, the measure of our desire for other
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:47.000]   people's happiness, which is very radical. Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Are
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.080]   you pursuing your own happiness? Yes, you are. You are. Then make that the measure of
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:03.040]   your pursuit of other people's happiness, other people's good. So I would simply add
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.440]   this to your strategy against selfishness. Whenever you pursue something for yourself,
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   which you will, you must, you eat, you sleep, you get exercise. Whenever you pursue something
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:25.040]   for yourself, ask this, "Do I have an effective desire in my heart that others would share
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:34.720]   with me in this temporal or eternal good and happiness?" It's not selfish to seek your
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:46.080]   own happiness if part of, essential to your own happiness is the sincere desire to include
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.680]   others in it.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.080]   The best way to fight selfishness is not to think about selfishness, but to think about
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.520]   Christ and specifically to think about what a great Savior He is, what a great counselor
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.800]   He is, a great friend, Lord, sustainer, champion.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.040]   So moving. Thank you, Pastor John, for this reminder to look again to Christ and to see
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:15.600]   that He broke us free from our selfishness by His selfless blood.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.800]   Thanks for joining us today. If you want to ask Pastor John, type out your question and
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.640]   email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.800]   Well in each generation, God seems to raise influential leaders in the church, men who
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.160]   leave behind a lasting gospel impact on the church. I'd put Pastor John in that category.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.560]   So what happens when such voices begin to pass away like we saw this spring? Natasha,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.560]   a listener wants to know next time she expresses her fear for the future of the modern church
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.480]   when trusted voices are gone. The sobering question. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.360]   see you on Monday.
