[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   As Romans 8, 1 is one of the great texts of the Bible for the Christian,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   our justification in Christ is life-changing.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And this declaration from the courtroom of God is meant to free us
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and to change our lives from top to bottom.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Our marriages, our jobs, our lives as students,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   everything we do and everything that we are is impacted by this glorious declaration
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   that our lives are now free from condemnation.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   And a life lived in this glorious reality will be free,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   as Pastor John explains in this sermon clip sent to us from Joel,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   a college student in Atlanta.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Here's Pastor John applying Romans 8, verse 1.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   What about no condemnation in marriage difficulties?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Is that practical enough?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Anybody have any problems in your marriage?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Suppose you're this morning disappointed.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I mean maybe some of you are really big time, life-long disappointed.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It isn't what you bargained for at all.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   How are you going to find the emotional and moral power
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   not to return evil for evil?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   To return good for evil?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   To be kind and forgiving and loving and tender-hearted
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   when you feel so unjustly handed by God?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Answer, you're going to remind yourself day in and day out,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I'm a sinner.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I'm an ungodly, undeserving, hell-deserving sinner.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And there flies over my life a blood-bought banner.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   No condemnation.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I swim in a reservoir of free grace,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and I will manage a lifetime of buckets for my wife.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I don't care what she does.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That would save a marriage.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Maybe God would step in and make it good.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I know the testimonies.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It does happen, folks.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   But you know what?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   If it never happens, that's okay.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   You got 85 million ages of years
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   when there is no more marriage or giving in marriage
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   but only our husband.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The sweetest, deepest pleasures you will ever know.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Dip into the reservoir of no condemnation.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Pour them out on husband.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Pour them out on wife.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And what if your kid is breaking your heart?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And your own conscience is quite adequate to tell you you're the problem.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's your fault.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It's your fault.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   How are you going to stay above water?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   How are you going to just keep on with the other kids?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Or how are you going to keep on with that kid?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   How are you going to keep loving?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   How are you going to keep coming back?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You know what?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   You will never sort out how much is your fault and how much wasn't.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Ever.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Ever, ever, ever.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You will never sort that out.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So, you come to me for counseling on that issue and say,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   "Can you help me sort this out? You know what I'm going to say?"
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   "No."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   "My next sentence is going to be, 'Nor do I care, nor need you care.'"
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   You'll never sort that out.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I've got good news for you.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   You're standing with Almighty God and the moral resources that you can appropriate
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   for living on your face in humility before that kid
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   don't depend on whether you blew it or not.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Because there is, therefore, now no condemnation for any parent in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So, that's practical.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Here's what might happen.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Living, swimming in that ocean of no condemnation grace.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You know what will happen?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You will be so humbled.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   This is the mark of whether it's really happening or not, by the way.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We've got a lot of people who hit people over the head with their doctrine.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   The evidence of whether glorious doctrine like this is taking any effect in people's lives
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   is how humble it makes them.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   If you humble yourself under this child so that you go to this kid, 5 or 50,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   and say, "You know, I don't know how much is me and how much is you
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and how much is your sister, brother, dad, or friends.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I just know I've got a lot of responsibility here, and I am so sorry for my failures."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Where does that freedom come from?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Out loud, not feeling it only, but saying it.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Where does that come from?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   It comes from Romans 8, 1.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And on and on we could go, but I guess stop.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We could talk about sexual temptation and no condemnation.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   We could talk about ministry and no condemnation.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   We could talk about peer pressure.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   A lot of young people in this.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Let me say a word about this.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Just a teeny word.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Teeny word.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   A lot of college students, a lot of high school students in this room.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Peer pressure.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Is my hair right?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Is this the way it's supposed to be on the first day of school?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Oh, nobody else has hair like this.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Or how do you carry your books this year?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Is it like this or like this?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Do you use briefcases?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Oh, what a nerd.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Shoes?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Ah, they were in last year.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Shoot, I should have gotten around this summer.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I mean, come on, get a life.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Where are you going to get free from that kind of bondage?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Jellyfish.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Teenage jellyfish.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Everywhere.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I want a few dolphins in this church.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Against the tide.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Who cares?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Good night.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And I'll tell you how you get free from that kind of bondage.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   There is therefore now no condemnation over your head.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You've got a Father in heaven whose approval of you is 10,000 times more important than what Mary or Joe think about what you're wearing.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Or whether the right kind of cool word just came out of your mouth.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Or you saw the right TV program or the right movie or like the right group or wear the right shoes or get the hair twisted just right.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Come on, let's be free.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Christianity is about freedom.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And then I'll close by saying, you know, all this freedom that I'm talking about here, all this no condemnation, liberty is not to free you up to be a fat cat American consumer.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Well, the pastor, he dumped on social action this morning.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   So I'm free.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Go back to my nice suburban house in my three or four cars with my two cabins and my boats and my whatever.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And because I don't have to worry about housing.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I don't have to worry about poverty.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I don't have to worry about drugs.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I don't have to worry about broken families.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I don't have to worry about 10,000 people a day who fall into eternity in lands that have no church.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Because he said it's about me and God getting right with each other.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   That's the devil talking.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You talk to me like that.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I said, you didn't get it at all.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   You are free to die.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   You are free to become radical.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   You are free to serve.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And I could preach another message here, but we got lots more years.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   God willing, let's pray.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So good.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   This next clip is from John Piper's sermon on Romans 8, 1 titled "No Condemnation in Christ Jesus."
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   No condemnation in Christ Jesus.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   The sermon was preached on September 9, 2001, just two days before the infamous day of 9/11.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Incredible.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   This clip was sent in to us by Joel, a college student in Atlanta.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   This is such an encouraging clip he wrote about the practical effects of holding to the truth of no condemnation.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   In Romans 8, 1, from marriage issues, parenting issues, to teen issues and more.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   The dolphin and jellyfish metaphor is quintessential Piper.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It sure is.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Thank you, Joel, for that.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   All our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And we share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   If you have one, email me.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Give me your name, your hometown, the sermon title, and the timestamp of when the clip happens in the audio, and how it impacted you.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That's an email address.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Well, is the COVID-19 vaccine the mark of the beast?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   No, it's not.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   But we are living in a time when there are all sorts of Christian conspiracy theories about.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Should we buy into them?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Why or why not?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It's an important topic coming up next time.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I'm here with Tony Reinke.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   We'll see you back here on Friday with Pastor John back in the studio.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   We'll see you then.
