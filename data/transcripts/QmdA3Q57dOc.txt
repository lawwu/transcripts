[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - We have been talking a lot in the last two weeks
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.160]   about Bible study, and we have a question today
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.240]   about how to read scripture on a specific theme.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.400]   Rosemary in Kentucky asks this,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.080]   "Hi, Pastor John, lately, a friend and I
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720]   "have been discussing a specific topic
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120]   "that is prevalent throughout the New Testament.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.620]   "I have not done much personal study on the topic,
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.940]   "and my first thought was,
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.080]   "I'll just search for some articles about the topic
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.640]   "on desiringgod.org or the Gospel Coalition
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.360]   "and find out what the Bible says about it that way.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.480]   "Though I have tremendous respect for both organizations,"
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.320]   thank you, "and many others that teach sound doctrine,
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.540]   "I feel like I am taking the easy way out
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.780]   "in reading the conclusions other people have come to
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.480]   "after studying the scriptures themselves.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.880]   "So my question is this,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.480]   "how should I go about studying a topic in scripture
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.640]   "in a comprehensive way that would allow me
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   "to have a firm grasp on what the Bible has to say
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.680]   "about a topic without relying solely on the study
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.240]   "and teaching of others to establish my own understanding?
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.800]   "But to do this, where do I begin?"
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.600]   - I love this question,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.480]   because I think many people sell themselves short
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.020]   when it comes to what they are able to glean
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.240]   from the scriptures for their own spiritual enrichment
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.440]   and depth and for their life
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.200]   in a complicated, morally complex world.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.660]   I think most of us doubt our capacities
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.240]   to find answers for ourselves,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.040]   and others of us are lazy, let's be honest,
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.440]   and we want somebody else to do the work for us,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.960]   and so we try to get a quick answer from somebody else
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.600]   rather than do it ourselves with rigorous study.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.560]   I mean, it is remarkable, I think,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.320]   that the Bible, by and large,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.040]   says it's not gonna give its riches
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.660]   to people who don't dig.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.240]   Listen to Proverbs 2, three to six.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.200]   "Yes, if you call out for insight
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.540]   "and raise your voice for understanding,
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.720]   "if you seek it like silver
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.580]   "and search for it as for hidden treasures,
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.680]   "then you will understand the fear of the Lord
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.560]   "and find the knowledge of God,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.920]   "for the Lord gives wisdom.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680]   "From his mouth come knowledge and understanding."
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160]   That doesn't sound like a lazy pursuit.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.140]   It sounds like an old prospector in the gold rush
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.520]   desperately wanting to find his fortune
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.640]   by working morning till night panning for gold,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.820]   and that's the picture that we're supposed to see here,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.520]   search for it as for hidden treasure.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.360]   The flag waving over the Scriptures
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.880]   is the word from Jeremiah 29, 13.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.000]   "You will seek me and find me
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   "when you seek me with all your heart."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.960]   So I'm excited that we're talking about
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.400]   the possibilities for just ordinary lay people doing that.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.560]   So I love the question
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200]   because of the hopefulness that's in it,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.960]   and the advice I have to give
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.920]   for studying a topic on your own from Scripture
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   is painfully simple.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.940]   There may be complex aspects
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.600]   of the application of this principle,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   but in my life, this simple counsel and practice
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.240]   has made all the difference.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.640]   So here it is.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   Once you know the topic that you want to investigate,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.320]   money maybe, or marriage, or pick your topic,
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.060]   politics, pick out a few key words
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.520]   that relate to that topic,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.420]   and use a concordance,
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.400]   that's a book that lists all the uses
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.740]   of all the words in the Bible,
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.480]   or better, have a simple Bible program.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.580]   You can get them inexpensively or even free
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.380]   that enables you to do word searches,
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.900]   have a Bible program,
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.660]   and either with a concordance
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.540]   or with a word-searching function of a Bible program,
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.540]   look up all those words in the Bible,
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.220]   or in some part of the Bible.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.220]   You might want to restrict your study to Romans, or Matthew,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.780]   or everything Paul wrote, or everything Peter wrote,
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.580]   or the New Testament, or indeed the whole Bible.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.780]   Just don't bite off more than you can chew at any one time.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.740]   So now you have clicked your button
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.860]   or you've looked up the word in the concordance
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.740]   and you have 10 or 50 key words in verses,
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.180]   so 50 verses or so that you've got to read.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.740]   Now, what do you do with that list?
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.980]   But that's the key thing.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.100]   What do you do with it?
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.660]   I'm going to give you seven things to do with it real quick.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.660]   One, make discoveries as you read them and jot them down.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.600]   You will make discoveries.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.940]   Number two, make connections between the discoveries
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.100]   as you keep reading and jot those connections down.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.080]   This is where insight begins to really snowball.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.460]   Regularly, when I do this,
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.380]   I see this use of the word here in Romans.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.460]   I see this use of the word in another part of Romans.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.820]   I see this use of the word over in 1 Corinthians.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.780]   I see this use of the word over in 1 Timothy.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.300]   And by that time, I've got five fresh insights
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.100]   about the reality I'm looking for.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.300]   So first, discoveries, second, connections,
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.340]   make connections, here's third.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.860]   Take time to think about these connections
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.300]   and jot down your ideas.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.240]   Many people have the notion that simply reading
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.860]   and observing the Bible causes insight and wisdom.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.820]   It doesn't, it doesn't.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.860]   You've got to think, you've got to think over.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.940]   Paul said to Timothy, "Think over what I say to you
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.560]   "and God will give you understanding."
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.400]   So first, discoveries, second, connections,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.200]   third, think, here's number four.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   Trace out the leads that you find.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.080]   Trace it out into other scriptures
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.200]   that shed lots of light on the verses.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.320]   Now, what I mean here is there are things about your topic
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.440]   in other passages of scripture that you can't find
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.360]   by simply the word connections that you just looked up.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.520]   You have to spot connections.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.400]   The way you see them is, oh, in this verse, it says this,
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.040]   and now you've got a new word to look up,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.080]   and you click on that word and you find five other verses
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.600]   that didn't have your original word in it
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.520]   and yet have lots of insights.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.800]   Or you might see in a little footnote,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.000]   a little A, B, C, or D attached,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.560]   a footnote that says,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   "Look at these verses about this issue."
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.360]   So trace out the leads that you find.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.260]   So number one, discoveries, number two, connections,
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.760]   number three, think, number four, trace,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.040]   and here's number five, write these things down.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.520]   Be writing, writing, writing,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.160]   either in a file on your computer
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.400]   or like I do often with a folded half sheet of paper
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.560]   that I'm doodling on, I'm constantly writing
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.360]   because when I write,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.960]   I'm able to hold more things in my head.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.480]   Without writing, everything tends to be a muddle.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.280]   It's just so complex, and so people that aren't writing
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.000]   really aren't gonna go very far
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.400]   in bringing a coherent picture of some reality.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.560]   So if you're really serious,
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.520]   that you want to discover what the writers at Desiring God
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.960]   and the writers at Gospel Coalition are saying,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.720]   you gotta do your own writing.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.760]   You can't just hold it in your head.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.320]   Only Einstein could do that.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.240]   Einstein, they said, could look at the same thing
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.120]   from 118 different angles in a few weeks.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.200]   Well, no way could I ever do that.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.680]   I've got to write down those 118 things on paper
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.880]   if I'm ever going to do it.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.900]   So that's the number five, writing.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.100]   Number six, consult now, now,
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.360]   some commentaries or Bible dictionaries
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.280]   or books written on the topic
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.160]   because now, because of all that you've seen,
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.440]   you will be a much more competent dialogue partner
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.960]   with this author, and you will have a lot more confidence.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.920]   You'll know the kind of questions to ask.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.480]   And the last thing I would say is preserve.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.920]   Preserve what you've seen,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.980]   either in the document and the file
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.960]   that you're creating online
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.600]   or a piece of paper you're gonna file somewhere
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.960]   because how sad to do an hour or two or three
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.220]   of study on something, have lots of wonderful insights,
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.000]   and a week later or a year later,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.940]   you don't remember anything that you saw.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.400]   That's really, really sad.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.800]   That's bad stewardship, so preserve it.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.560]   But underneath those seven pointers is a main point,
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.160]   namely use the word search feature of a Bible program
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.000]   or use a concordance.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.860]   Nothing yields more fruit in a coherent understanding
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.160]   of a topic across the Scriptures
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.480]   than looking at all the different ways
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.120]   the Bible speaks about it,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.640]   and you find those with word searches.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.200]   - Yeah, painfully simple, as you said at the beginning.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   And if you don't have an electronic Bible that you use
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.880]   or if you don't have an electronic Bible

[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.200]   Well, we have run up against the weekend again,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.280]   and I encourage you all to subscribe to our podcast

[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.280]   but we plan to return on Monday, Lord willing,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.160]   always Lord willing.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.800]   And until then, I'm your host Tony Renke.
