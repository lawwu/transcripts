[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.060]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.120]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.080]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so happy you're here, but there is always room for
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.000]   more happiness, and that's exactly what we're talking about today.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.120]   I'm joined by Arthur Brooks, a social scientist who studies human
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.320]   happiness and teaches about it and leadership as a professor at Harvard.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.800]   He's the best-selling author of 12 books, including his most recent.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.200]   And the topic of our conversation today, finding success, happiness, and deep
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.160]   purpose in the second half of life, which debuted last month at the number one
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.400]   spot on the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.840]   He's also the creator of the popular how to build a life column in the Atlantic.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.900]   And previously he served for 10 years as the president of the American
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.600]   Enterprise Institute, a think tank in DC, during which time he was named as
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.360]   one of fortune magazine's world's 50 greatest leaders, Arthur is a wealth
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.160]   of knowledge, and I am excited to chat with him about how we can all live
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.960]   happier and more fulfilling lives.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.080]   We'll dig into all the tactics and hacks you need to start putting these
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.840]   lessons into practice today, and hopefully also touch a bit on the
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.920]   links between money and happiness.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.520]   There is a lot to cover.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.760]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.320]   Arthur, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.160]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.000]   I'm delighted.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.800]   It's going to be great.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.680]   When I first read the title of this book, I thought maybe this book is
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.360]   for my parents and it's not for me.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.400]   Now I've since learned that that's maybe not the case, but could you talk
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.840]   about who the book's for and how that's different from maybe the time
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.000]   of your life that it's about?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.400]   Yeah, this is a book that basically says you don't have to leave your
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   happiness up to chance as you get older.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   And, you know, there are people who are old who are going to read it and
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.960]   there are people who want to get old and there are people who are getting
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.920]   older and that is 100% of the population.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.600]   And a lot of people think like, am I going to be happy when I'm old?
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.360]   I don't know.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.040]   Hope so.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.600]   Live right.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.360]   Hope for the best.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.760]   And, and this book is basically a claim based on science and talking to the
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.960]   happiest people and the unhappiest people as they get older, that we don't
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.320]   have to leave our happiness up to chance.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.560]   You can build a happiness 401k.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.720]   Now we all know, and you know perfectly well, because you do a lot of stuff
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.920]   in finance, that the sooner you start your savings, the better it's
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.400]   going to look when you're older.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.800]   So this is about happiness in the second half of life, but it's about starting
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.880]   to get happier in the first half of life.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.720]   I love that.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.480]   I think we all want to be happy, but one thing I think it's important is how
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.600]   are we defining happiness in these conversations here and in the book?
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.280]   As the first thing I ask my students, I have this MBA class that teaches
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.960]   at Harvard Business School.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.240]   And the first day of class, I go around and say, what's happiness?
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.520]   And they start talking about their feelings.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.960]   The way you feel when dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.680]   It's the feeling of whatever.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.920]   That's not right.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.120]   And that's like saying that Thanksgiving dinner is the smell of the turkey.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.400]   That's not the Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.120]   That's evidence of the Thanksgiving dinner that you can perceive.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.080]   Happy feelings are evidence of happiness.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.200]   Happiness is something else.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.960]   When I look at the social scientists and people who are happy and unhappy,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.280]   happiness is a combination of three.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.040]   You might say they're macronutrients.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.320]   So food can be defined in terms of three macronutrients,
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.680]   protein, carbohydrates, and fat.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.360]   And you have to have them in balance and abundance.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.240]   If you're going to have good health and feel good.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.400]   Happiness has three macronutrients that you need in balance and abundance.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.160]   You need enjoyment, you need satisfaction, and you need purpose.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.640]   When I meet somebody who is not happy, I start looking
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.720]   diagnostically at these three things.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.960]   The first practical takeaway that comes from all this theory is that if somebody
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.840]   is like, ah, my life isn't complete.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.040]   Some things are good.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.560]   Some things aren't, but I'm not really happy.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.080]   It means there's a lack of balance in one of these things.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.600]   Either you don't have enough enjoyment in your life or you're actually not hitting
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.240]   goals, which means you don't have satisfaction or you don't have a sense
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.120]   of purpose and direction in your life.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.880]   It's one of those three things.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.880]   And so that's the first place to start looking.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.720]   If you feel like you're not where you want to be in terms of your happiness.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.560]   Is there like a quiz or a question you can ask yourself for each one of those
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.160]   things to figure out how you are on each one?
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.000]   There actually are.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.600]   And that's why I write my column in the Atlantic every Thursday morning.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.760]   So I'm digging into different aspects of that.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.480]   And so the column in the Atlantic has got a whole bunch of quizzes.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.360]   People who are into it, they want to read a little bit of the underlying research.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.880]   Sometimes I'll talk about it like the Greek philosophers did.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.640]   So Epicurus said, happiness is all enjoyment.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   And the Stoics said, happiness is all virtue and meaning.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.760]   And the truth is, we need to be both.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.160]   I have a column about, are you more Epicurus or are you more Epictetus?
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.400]   And it actually has a quiz in there on how to do that.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.160]   So my column on that is a good way to start to test yourself.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.840]   Well, like to the column and maybe some of those quizzes in the show notes.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.920]   Yeah. One of the things I saw in the book that I thought was interesting was
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.400]   the reason why this shift from the beginning of your life.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.640]   I've seemed to be somewhat linked to the type of intelligence we have
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.280]   and how that changes over time.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.160]   I think most people here
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.880]   probably haven't heard about fluid and crystallized intelligence.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.320]   Can you walk through that for people who aren't familiar?
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.280]   Yeah, this book has the seven habits of people who get happier as they age.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.400]   And there's one thing to keep in mind
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.600]   that's really important that I found over the course of my research
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.680]   is that there's a lot of similarity in the patterns of happiness
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.840]   over the first part of their lives.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.680]   Generally speaking, the older you get, the more that people diverge.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.720]   So you see that people after about 65 go into two groups.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.080]   One gets happier and the other gets less happy.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.560]   And the group that's getting less happy, paradoxically,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.280]   they tend to be the strivers who work the hardest early in their lives.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.200]   You got to look at that. That's a big mystery.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.000]   That doesn't mean it has to be that way, but we need skills.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.640]   That's why I have the seven skills that the happiest people later in life have.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.280]   So that even if you are a striver, you're not doomed.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.760]   You just have to adopt these skills and do the work is what it comes down to.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.640]   You know, everybody who is getting the hacks needs the hacks.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.040]   And these are the seven hacks.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.520]   Now, what's the first skill?
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.120]   And the first skill is making sure that you're on the right success curve.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.080]   A little bit of background on this.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.920]   For about 100 years, psychologists have noticed that there's two types of geniuses.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.680]   There's early bloomers, people who have an early appearance
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.640]   in their genius, like child geniuses and young entrepreneurs.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.280]   And then you've got the late bloomers, the Elon Musks and the Dalai Lamas.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.520]   Those are the two types of geniuses out there.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.400]   One's really young and one's really old.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.480]   For the longest time, we thought, well, two types of people,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.000]   the people who do this kind of thing, people do this type of thing.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.040]   Later, we figured out everybody has both.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.520]   That doesn't mean that I'm going to be Elon Musk or the Dalai Lama,
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.360]   but I have a lot of power to actually use my potential to the max.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.520]   Early on, it's going to be innovative capacity, processing speed,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.600]   indefatigability, my ability to go later in life.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.360]   My abilities migrate toward my wisdom, not necessarily to work all night
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.840]   and solve problems that are brand new and innovative,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.920]   but to take existing knowledge, understand what it means,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.480]   combine ideas and teach them.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.320]   That's what you're really good at later in life.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.120]   Now, the first type of genius is called fluid intelligence.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.840]   It increases naturally all the way through your 20s and early 30s.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.800]   And it starts to decline in your late 30s and goes down really fast in your 40s.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.480]   That's the reason that people are less likely to come up
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.600]   with some weird, big, eye-popping innovation when they're 50,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.360]   much less so than when they're 30.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   When you're 30, you're at maximum innovative capacity.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   In your 40s, you're crystallized intelligence.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.400]   That's the second type starts to increase,
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.040]   which means that you get more wisdom, more perspective.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.160]   You know more, you have a good memory.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.520]   Your memory actually improves in a lot of ways, believe it or not.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.320]   You can't recall Joe Smith's name.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.520]   You forget that, but you remember all the important things
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.800]   and you can combine them.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.720]   It's like you have a vast library and you know how to use it.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.080]   One of the reasons that you forget stuff when you're older
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.040]   is because your library is so big that it takes time to go
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.480]   get a piece of information. It's not degradation.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.960]   It's just the size of the library.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.760]   The filing system is dense.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.680]   And so later on in life, people use it.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.640]   They become better scrabble players.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.760]   They can actually be better at foreign languages,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.920]   even though their vocabulary is no good.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.400]   Historians do half of their work on average after age 65
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.960]   because of pure crystallized intelligence, this wisdom.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   They're teachers.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.120]   And at my university, the best teaching evaluations
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.880]   are uniformly over 70 years old.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.800]   That's crystallized intelligence.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.440]   The key thing is you got to be on the right curve.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.840]   If you're 50 or 60 years old, you're like,
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.640]   I'm struggling to keep up with a 30 year olds.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.800]   You're doomed, man. You're doomed.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.320]   You're going to feel horrible about yourself.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.120]   You're going to run circles around you.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.080]   But here's what you need to do.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.320]   You need to school them with your wisdom.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.200]   This has so much potential for rocking our world.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.040]   Basically, you're on the first curve.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.800]   And here's the thing.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.000]   If you want to be happy and successful,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.040]   you got to jump to the second curve.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.280]   You got to go from the Elon Musk to the Dalai Lama.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.920]   You got to go from the innovator to the instructor.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   You might change jobs and might not.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.480]   But you got to retool your life
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.040]   and what you're paying attention to and what you're trying to do.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.200]   That's the first big skill of people who get happier as they age.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.880]   So if you're someone listening to this and you're like, OK,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.560]   I'm in that late 20s, early 30s part of my life.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.000]   I know I need to jump the curve eventually.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.800]   What does that jump look like?
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.120]   How do I prepare for it?
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.760]   What should I be doing with my time?
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.240]   OK, so to begin with, when you're starting to see the decline,
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.400]   you're going to see it before anybody else does.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.280]   The big problem is if you deny it and rage against it.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.920]   But you're going to notice that if you're starting to burn out a little bit,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   you're starting to be a little less interested.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.960]   The reason you want to do it less is because you're not
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.560]   as naturally good at it as you were before.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.680]   That's your tell.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   Ability is not to tell.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.680]   Desire is always the tell.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.840]   Desire tells all always.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.560]   What you like always indicates what your capacities are.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.840]   And so when you're first learning, it's like, I don't know, man,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.320]   this guy came to me with this great new startup idea.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.680]   But I like I don't have a fire in the belly anymore.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.960]   That's a good sign.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.360]   That means that you're actually in liminality.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.240]   You're between the curves.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.280]   So what do you need to do?
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.480]   You need to learn and you need to actually start combining knowledge
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.120]   instead of writing the book that has the big new mathematical treatise
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.720]   that nobody's ever come up with before.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.760]   You write the book that combines everybody's best idea
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.000]   and start learning about synthesis of things
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.240]   as opposed to the creation of brand new ideas, synthesize things
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.280]   as opposed to inventing things.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.040]   And that means different things in different professions.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.080]   If you're a lawyer,
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.200]   that means what you should do is you start running a team of young lawyers.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.240]   You should go from a cowboy to a team leader.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.600]   That's a really good way to do it.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.640]   If you're going to be an entrepreneur, don't come up with a big innovation.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.200]   Find people who can and make them successful.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.360]   That's the reason that great athletes who are unbelievable early in their careers.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.600]   They're really, really good as commentators on TV.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.680]   It's not just because their knees have gone out, right?
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.960]   It's the same reason that entrepreneurs who are unbelievably successful
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.280]   can be graded VC later because what they are is actually teachers.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.400]   They're cultivating the next big talent.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.320]   And every profession has something like this.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.800]   Are there people that kind of are household names
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.440]   that have either done this well or poorly that bring the example to life?
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.440]   There are a lot of historical figures that have done it poorly and well.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.400]   In the book, they talk about Charles Darwin.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.040]   Charles Darwin is on everybody's list of greatest scientists.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.760]   He changed the way that we think with this theory of natural selection
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.200]   and the theory of evolution. Unbelievable.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.600]   He came up with that at age 27
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   when he came back from his around the world voyage on the Beagle
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.040]   collecting botanical and zoological samples from his late 20s.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.320]   He was already the most celebrated scientist in Europe.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.280]   He was rich. He was he was the king of the Mambo, man.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.600]   I mean, it was unbelievable.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.160]   And he dined out on these theories for the next 30 years.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.200]   He just developed them, nurtured them and used this big innovation.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.960]   Now, the problem was he got stuck when he was about 50 years old
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.880]   because he hadn't been a very motivated student.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.960]   So he didn't learn very much math or statistics.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.160]   He didn't learn German.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.560]   And if you were going to be a serious scientist,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.760]   you needed to know German in the late 19th century.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.960]   So what happened was that his own field passed him by mathematically.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.360]   There's a Czech priest and scientist named Gregor Mendel,
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.800]   who actually was more mathematically sophisticated.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.000]   He invented the theory of genetics.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.240]   And that's what Charles Darwin needed to progress in his own field.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.200]   And he couldn't understand it, couldn't read it and got stuck.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.280]   And from the age of 50 until he died at 73, he never did original work ever again.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.400]   He wrote 11 more books, but he hated them all.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.720]   He died feeling like a disappointment. Why?
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.040]   He was stuck on his first curve, Chris.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.520]   He was on his fluid intelligence curve, and it doesn't have to be that way
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.920]   because he could have jumped onto the second curve,
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.280]   but he didn't know it existed or he didn't want to do that.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.960]   That's the mistake.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.640]   OK, let's get a better case study.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.080]   Somebody did it right.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.200]   Johann Sebastian Bach, the greatest composer who ever lived,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.920]   according to a lot of people, including me.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.600]   I made the first 12 years of my career as a classical musician
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.360]   and Bach was my favorite composer.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.240]   He was unbelievable.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.520]   He was the innovator of the High Baroque.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.600]   He was inventing mind blowing stuff when he was in his 20s.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.760]   He was so famous. He was so great.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.720]   And then music passed him by at the age of 50.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.880]   His son, he had 20 kids, by the way.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.640]   So that guy was productive.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.480]   His son, Karl Philipp Emanuel Bach, invented a new style of music
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.720]   called the classical style, and Bach, the father, couldn't keep up.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.040]   He's like, I don't know how to write in this style.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.920]   He couldn't keep up because his fluid intelligence was too low.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.640]   So what did he do?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.880]   He retooled his career as a teacher.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.480]   He turned from writing original pieces of music to writing textbooks
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.240]   about the High Baroque.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.160]   He went from doing commissions for the greatest pieces of music
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.840]   to writing music for the church as part of his teaching responsibilities.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.400]   And he became the most beloved teacher of his time.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.200]   He was jumping onto his crystallized intelligence curve.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.960]   He had a studio full of students who adored him.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.400]   He was known as a truly great teacher.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   He was working on this textbook called The Art of Fugue.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.080]   He literally died mid-measure while writing one of the fugues.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.040]   A hundred years later, a famous composer named Felix Mendelssohn
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.720]   found his manuscript.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.640]   It's like, dude, you got to hear this to his friends.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.520]   And they played it like this is beautiful.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.080]   Today, we play that textbook as a work of art.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.840]   He died with his kids surrounding him and his students
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.920]   surrounding him and his grandkids surrounding him.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.680]   And he died with love and happiness on his success curve, by the way,
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.920]   on his better success curve, because dying happy is a good way to die.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.480]   Yeah. So he definitely nailed skill number one.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.680]   And two. OK, he nailed it, man.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.280]   He nailed it.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.280]   And he was a living proof that everybody's got both.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.400]   But you got to jump when it's time to jump.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.960]   You have to have faith that it exists and you got to have courage to make the change.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.080]   And then what? What's next?
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.480]   The skills you got to master next are the things that make you not want to jump
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.000]   and the things that make it easier.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.480]   So one of the key things you find about people who are really unhappy
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.800]   and actually can't get happier, they wind up going downward in their happiness
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.840]   and stuck on this fluid intelligence curve and thinking about the past
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.640]   and kind of pissed off because, you know, I'm not appreciated anymore
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.120]   and trying to hide their weaknesses and all that.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.920]   They have a really bad and nasty addiction,
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.080]   which is something that a lot of people suffer from.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.840]   It's a success addiction.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.560]   Now, all addictions implicate a neuromodulator in the brain called dopamine.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.760]   Dopamine is the neurotransmitter of reward.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.120]   It's of anticipation.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:34.720]   This is what gets you addicted to alcohol or cigarettes or gambling or methamphetamine.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.040]   It's the dopamine that makes you want it, want it, want it.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.240]   Gives you a mild burst of satisfaction.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.920]   And then it goes away and you want it again, hit the lever again.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.240]   We're like monkeys on cocaine.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.840]   We lose our sense of proportion.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.280]   We lose our sense of inhibition.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.880]   We hit the lever, hit the lever, hit the lever again and again and again.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.520]   Addiction is bad because dopamine can chain us.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.200]   The worst kind of addiction that I see for really, really successful people.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.720]   I mean, some drink too much.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.360]   Some smoke. They shouldn't.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.200]   But they're success addicts.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.240]   You know what? A lot of the ambitious people you and I know from a young age,
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.520]   their parents are like, you're special.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.880]   You're a hard worker.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.040]   You get A's. You always win.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.320]   I mean, they objectify their kids and the kids objectify themselves
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.400]   as homo economicus, as the victorious one, as the successful one.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.760]   And they get the cookie of success and they hit the lever.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.120]   They get the promotion.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.240]   They get the extra money.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.400]   They get the adulation.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.280]   They get the compliments and they love it.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.360]   It literally it stimulates dopamine in their brain.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.560]   And when they're getting better on their fluid intelligence curve, man,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.480]   it's like flying with terrifying speed.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.800]   It's like the monkey in front of the lever, hitting the lever again
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.320]   and again and again and again.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.160]   And then when the hits come less frequently, it's misery.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.320]   It's a dysphoria.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.680]   It's literally a scarcity of dopamine in the brain.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.840]   And this is one of the things that distracts them
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.960]   from the evolution of their own strengths.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.000]   Addiction makes them unable to pursue happiness.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.880]   You know, I live in Silicon Valley.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.600]   So often, everyone's like, you got to find your purpose.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.080]   Whatever you're working on, it could be bigger.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.240]   You could be doing more.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.480]   I juxtapose that to most of the people who I know who aren't obsessed
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.640]   with that seem much happier in their lives.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.400]   Yet it's still something that even knowing that so many people chase.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.560]   Hustle culture is a cult called workism,
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.920]   where your work is your identity, your work is your fulfillment.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.000]   Your work is your ego.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.160]   Your work is everything.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.760]   And your work is your pleasure because of your success addiction.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.880]   The main thing that we need to do is to establish what we call metacognition.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.080]   Metacognition is very simple.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.520]   The Buddhists always say when you have feelings and urges,
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.040]   you need to observe those feelings and urges.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.680]   Now, literally what's going on neurophysiologically
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.080]   is that an urge or a feeling originates in the limbic system of the brain.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.280]   That's the lizard brain.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.760]   That's the back part of your brain that is stimulated
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.240]   automatically because of outside happenings.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.960]   You'll be managed by that if you're reactive
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.080]   and you're simply hitting the lever.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.760]   If you're a cocaine monkey, you're just a limbic creature.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.440]   You're like my dog, Chucho.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.040]   Sees the cookie, eats the cookie.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.560]   He's highly mindful.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.840]   He's not paying any positive attention or spending any time thinking about anything.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.720]   That's how a lot of people are who are deeply workist in that cult.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.120]   The way to defeat that is by simply journaling and thinking
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.040]   and putting time between your impulses and your actions.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.760]   The Buddhists always say the time between action and reaction
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.440]   is the humanity in what we do.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.560]   It's the true humanness in what we do.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.400]   What's really going on here is you're moving an urge
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.280]   from your limbic system of your brain to your prefrontal cortex.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.040]   That's the human part of your brain, the big meaty lobes behind your forehead.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.320]   Once it's there, you can manage it to be metacognitive is to say, OK,
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.760]   I have the urge to be successful.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.840]   I feel like I'm going to be unhappy unless I'm successful.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.520]   And yet I'm not happy.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.040]   You need to start journaling.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.960]   That's the bottom line.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.640]   Journaling, it sounds sort of wimpy and weak and kind of dumb and sentimental.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.880]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.840]   This is highly neuroscientific.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.320]   Journaling is the single best way to go from my dog Chucho to me,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.080]   to my prefrontal cortex.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.960]   It moves your urges into the front part of your brain,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.000]   and then you can manage them.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.080]   That's the single best technique for breaking.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.520]   These addictions is thinking about them metacognitively.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.480]   Do you need to journal that often to benefit from journaling?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.600]   I actually do recommend writing down a few thoughts every day.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.200]   I don't think that actually spending half an hour in the morning,
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.640]   half an hour at noon, half an hour at night is probably a really great use of your time.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.840]   I think it's really, really important to make sure that you record what you're doing.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.160]   Now, some people don't have to do this in terms of journaling.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.240]   One of the great things about functioning romantic partnerships
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.120]   is that you can be jointly metacognitive, but you have to work every day
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.040]   to be talking about what's happening to you limbically,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.000]   to discuss your feelings with each other.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.240]   For example, when I'm feeling workist and it's really my tendency,
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.840]   but left to my devices, I'm cocaine monkey all day long.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.680]   I'm unhappy when I'm doing it.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.080]   And I know enough about that because I'm pretty metacognitive, pretty self-aware guy.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.120]   I don't necessarily go and write in my journal.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   What I do is I go and I talk to my wife and say, I got a problem.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.480]   I'm doing this thing again.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.880]   And we jointly metacognitively move it to the prefrontal cortex of my brain
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.320]   where I actually can manage it.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.640]   So having a partner with whom you can discuss these things with confidence
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.360]   is arguably an even more effective way to do this.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.280]   Could be a partner, your wife or your husband, it could be a friend,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.560]   I assume, or a mentor.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.200]   It has to be somebody who actually understands you,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.400]   who can do joint metacognition with you, which is to say they really want
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.720]   to understand what's happening to you limbically,
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.760]   and they want to help you manage it as an executive
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.840]   so they can actually function as the third lobe of your brain.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.520]   It has to be somebody who knows you deeply.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.000]   It can't be your subordinate at work.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.400]   That's not going to work at all.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.160]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.040]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.200]   and you have too many manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.240]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.440]   Thirty seven thousand, twenty five, one.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.000]   Thirty seven thousand.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.360]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.720]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.680]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.600]   streamlining accounting, financial management, inventory, HR and more.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.120]   Twenty five.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.000]   NetSuite turns twenty five this year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.600]   That's twenty five years of helping businesses do more with less,
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.480]   close their books in days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.120]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.440]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.560]   in one efficient system with one source of truth.

[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.280]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.640]   from all the companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.840]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.320]   is actually so good for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.200]   and easiest ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.160]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.520]   harvested leaves from two hundred and fifty year old tea trees
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.680]   rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.360]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides,
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.800]   heavy minerals and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.200]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.800]   in premeasured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.360]   in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.760]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.120]   between the green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh,
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.640]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.040]   that is so good and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.440]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.760]   backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart,
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.680]   blood sugar and more, and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.240]   in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.200]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.800]   because Peak offers free U.S.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.600]   shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.200]   with 12 tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.480]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:45.040]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.560]   I want to come back to some of these other skills that you can learn.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.200]   You said something interesting when it was OK, you could go to your partner.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.560]   There are things that I think often get construed with happiness.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.640]   Things like love or money.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   Are there components of happiness?
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.600]   I know you talked about enjoyment, satisfaction and purpose,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.000]   but some of the common things I think people think of.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.080]   I'm curious to get your perspective on them.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.480]   So let's at least include like love or romance and money
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.200]   and maybe other common things people think are associated with happiness.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.880]   And how do they fit into the picture?
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.160]   Sometimes they're idols and sometimes they're real.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.920]   So here's the way to think about that in a very practical way.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.200]   There are four things that you want that are idols
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.400]   and that have a little bit of a divine quality to them.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.840]   They attract you. They're magnetic.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.640]   You know you want them, but they're not intrinsically satisfying.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.120]   Those things are money, power, pleasure and fame.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.840]   All those things can be really good, but only when you pursue them
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.160]   instrumentally towards something that's more important than those things.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.840]   Money is great, but if you pursue it for its own sake,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.520]   it will leave you frustrated and empty.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.680]   Power is the same thing. You'll become a tyrant.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.840]   Pleasure is incomplete because it's entirely limbic.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.440]   It'll make you a little bit more animal.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.160]   You need to actually combine it with elevation and morality
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.200]   to make it into enjoyment, which is one of the macronutrients of happiness.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.960]   And fame is literally the only idol that we pursue.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.080]   You can only ever be happy in spite of.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.080]   It's super dangerous, which is why social media is making us all so crazy today
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.360]   because everybody can establish a little bit of local fame
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.800]   and they get a lot of dopamine by seeing likes.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.120]   And it's awful.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.800]   So those are the evil four.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.960]   And they're not evil if we use them appropriately like anything else.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.680]   Wine isn't evil until you become an alcoholic.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.040]   So these things create addiction and instrumentally they can be OK,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.360]   but intrinsically, they're the bad for they're the idols.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.080]   There's the good for now.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.680]   Here's the four accounts that you need to invest in every day.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.080]   If you want to be among the happiest people, this is what they all have in common.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.440]   There's ten thousand articles of the habits of the happiest people.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.680]   I've boiled the ocean down to these basic four.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.520]   They all do these things every day.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.760]   They practice their faith or life philosophy.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.160]   You don't have to be religious.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.560]   You have something bigger than you that zooms you out on your own life.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.800]   Your life is like the most boring sitcom ever with which you're obsessed.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.440]   My job, my car, my money, my it's just so boring.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.600]   And yet we're obsessed with it.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.440]   You need relief. You need peace.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.720]   Life philosophy or faith or spiritual practice gives you that uniquely.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.920]   So it's meditation or prayer or studying the Stoics or whatever it happens to be.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.320]   You got to do your thing and you got to do it seriously.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.720]   Second is family.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.880]   The ties that bind and don't break.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.760]   It's important that you not choose them, but that you have them for your happiness.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.880]   And God knows, in many cases, we wouldn't choose them.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.520]   Right, Chris.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.760]   And a lot of people having a lot of trouble, their families, one in six
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.640]   Americans is not talking to a family member because of politics today.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.400]   It's a huge problem for us, unless it's a case of abuse.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.760]   Don't let that be you is the bottom line.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.000]   The third is friendship.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.880]   We have a major loneliness crisis in the United States.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.120]   Vivek Murthy, our surgeon general, said that the biggest public health
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.640]   crisis in America today is loneliness, not the coronavirus epidemic,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.400]   not opioids, not guns.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.560]   No, no, no, no, no. Loneliness.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.960]   The average number of close friends that somebody 30 years old has
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.440]   has been cut in half in the past 20 years.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   About half of people under 30 say that no one knows them well.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.600]   It's horrible for every aspect of happiness.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.320]   And part of the reason for that is that everybody knows how to make deal friends.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.760]   But we know less and less how to make real friends.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.080]   My book talks about how to make real friends
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.760]   if you're incompetent because you've only had deal friends.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.560]   And the last is work.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.760]   And work doesn't mean working hard all night long.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.320]   It doesn't mean making tons of money.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.400]   It doesn't mean having prestige.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.160]   It means exactly two things.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.800]   Earning your success, meaning your skills, meet your passions
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.200]   and serving other people, the people who need you.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.080]   If you earn your success and you're serving other people,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.320]   I don't care if you're an electrician or a librarian or a podcast host
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.760]   or a Harvard professor, you will be happy from your work.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.640]   And if you don't have those things, you won't be happy from your work.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.200]   Faith, family, friends and work are the big four are the things
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.200]   that we need to shoot for.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.440]   And the things we need to avoid is intrinsics are money, power,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.800]   pleasure and fame.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.240]   There's a book called Happy Money, which talks about using money for happiness.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.120]   And one of the interesting things they say is spending money on others
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.280]   is one of the five ways that can make you happy.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.560]   That seems to fit a little bit in work.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.720]   But is it important to share happiness, to spread happiness,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.040]   to give happiness in order to be happy ourselves?
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.360]   Yeah, the way to get happier, there's an algorithm to it, believe it or not.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.480]   A lot of people wish they were happier, but they're not.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.400]   They're just obsessing on their unhappiness.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.520]   But like anything else, you got to do the work.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.800]   And there's three steps to it.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.200]   You need to understand it by doing the work and study it.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.600]   Learn what the practices are.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   Now, you can do it by talking to your grandmother.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.280]   You can do it by reading my column.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.560]   You can do it lots and lots of ways, but you've got to do the work.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.200]   The second is you got to practice it.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.400]   You got to apply it.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.200]   You can't read just a book about golf and become a better golfer.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.520]   You got to get out there and golf.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.600]   And so you need to take the applications that all of us in this field
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.480]   are talking about and practice them in your life.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.240]   Do your gratitude list, do your forgiveness exercise,
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.080]   do your happiness strategic plan.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.960]   But you got to do the application and then you got to share it.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.560]   This is the most beautiful thing of all.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.840]   Why? Because you've got to make it metacognitive.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.360]   The best way to make something metacognitive is to teach it.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.960]   Why? Because you can't teach something limbically.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.640]   You can only teach something from the executive center of your brain
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.000]   because you have to be able to articulate the idea.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.520]   And so if you want to get happier, you really have to understand it and manage it.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.720]   And the best way to do it is to teach it.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   And teaching is just another form of sharing.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.080]   So understand, apply, share.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.880]   That's your happiness algorithm.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.240]   Is sharing telling people about how they can be happy or trying to make people happy?
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.200]   Ordinarily, it's both.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.720]   But I actually strongly recommend showing your cards.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   And I've got this class.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.040]   I got 180 MBA students in my happiness class.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.480]   And so I say one of the ways they can get final credit for the class
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.680]   instead of writing the exam,
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.600]   they can set up their own happiness class for students who didn't get in.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.720]   So what do they do?
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.280]   They take my PowerPoint slides.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.320]   They take my name off.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.360]   They put their name on.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.960]   They put together their own syllabus and they videotape the classes.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.440]   They turn the whole thing in.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.240]   And they're becoming totally metacognitive in everything that we've talked about.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.200]   They will never forget these technologies once they teach them.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.760]   So here's the great thing about happiness.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.960]   The most beautiful thing.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.240]   Write it all down.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.680]   Make your slides.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.440]   Discuss it at dinner or talk about it and say, I heard Chris Hutchins podcast,
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.240]   which I love because it's a great podcast.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.840]   And he had this guy who teaches at Harvard talking about the science of happiness.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.320]   Here's the thing he said.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.720]   I guarantee you there will not be a peep.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.920]   People are going to be listening to you as if you were the Dalai Lama
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.600]   because everybody wants it.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.080]   It's great to be a happiness professor, because suffice it to say
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.960]   that it piques people's interest.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.360]   I love episodes like this.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.560]   Sometimes we talk about money and I know people aren't going to go home
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.880]   and meet up with their friends at night and be like, you know,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.720]   what's in your bank account?
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.120]   Maybe some of our listeners are more excited about investing,
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.760]   but when it comes to the deeply personal side of money, it doesn't get spread.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.400]   I know the other one that you just mentioned in the good for that.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.800]   I think I want to spend a minute on is with faith.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.040]   So you mentioned that it's not just organized religion, but I think so often
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.800]   someone might listen to this and think those two must be the same thing.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.320]   It's not for me. I'm kind of scared of this. Right.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.880]   But I hear it.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.640]   I'm like, gosh, you're telling me that the people that are the happiest
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.800]   have these four things.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.400]   How does someone who's maybe organized religion isn't a part of their life,
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.080]   but wants to bring faith into their life in the happiness sense?
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.800]   How would someone get started with that?
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.560]   There are lots and lots of ways to do that.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.160]   And so the two ways that I recommend, if you're uncomfortable
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.240]   with traditional religion and or prayer,
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.800]   I recommend that you start a secular meditation practice
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.080]   because meditation is highly concentrating.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.120]   It actually will bring you to mindfulness
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.280]   and at the same time can zoom you out on the experience of your own life.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.720]   It concentrates you on the experience of your own life
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.400]   and it zooms you out on the experience of your own life simultaneously.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.600]   It's also extremely satisfying and it can help you to rebalance
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.360]   your hormone profile, all kinds of good physiology behind it.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.240]   And the second thing is reading big ideas.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   Start with the Brothers Karamazov.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.280]   This is a study in human transcendence.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.680]   That's really what it is.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.200]   Read Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.720]   Read the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.080]   Read the Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:00.040]   All of these things are hugely available to us and they'll blow your mind.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.280]   If you're doing half an hour a day of that deep wisdom reading,
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.760]   you just won't be the same.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.920]   At some point, you might want to experiment with the religion of your youth
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.360]   because that stuff is unbelievable.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.240]   I'm a Catholic and Catholic philosopher, St.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.440]   Thomas Aquinas, he's the reason that we read Aristotle today.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.640]   Before him, nobody read Aristotle.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.280]   Aristotle was lost.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.400]   And he said, no, no, no.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.840]   Hey, guys, this is the best thing ever.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.280]   And you understand Aristotle in this brand new way,
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.480]   whether you're religious or not.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.800]   Read the Confessions of St.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.400]   Augustine, a study in human psychology about the stirrings of the human heart.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.680]   This stuff is so good.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.280]   By the way, even if you're not religious at all, read the Bible
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.560]   because it's the most culturally inflecting and impactful book ever written.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.720]   So just to understand what's going on in society,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.440]   it's a good idea to read the most impactful book that's ever been read.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.800]   You can actually think that God was behind the writing of it
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.000]   or not behind the writing of it.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.120]   Your mind will be blown.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.880]   You'll experience day to day life in a completely different way.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.200]   And that's really what it's all about, because you need relief
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.000]   from the reality show of Chris Hutchins' life.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.680]   Does that mean that practicing faith could just be reading these deep ideas
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.440]   like that is actually a method for that aspect of happiness?
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.720]   Now, what I recommend is reading them, but reading them in a very, very deep way.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.760]   When I talk about reading something, slow down and read two pages,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.200]   underline those two pages and take notes and then take 15 minutes
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.320]   and think deeply about what those ideas mean
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.560]   in the context of your day to day life.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.560]   That's what the ancient philosophers called Lectio Divina, divine reading.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.360]   In other words, is to let the reading ideas seep into your soul.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.640]   And it's a very powerful cognitive technique for reading in such a way
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.280]   that it really will change your perspective.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.000]   So, yeah, I just read Man's Search for Meaning today.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.960]   No, you didn't.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.040]   I read the writings of Seneca this week.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   It's like, get out of here.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.840]   You didn't. You read one page and then we'll talk.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.320]   Because it's so full of wisdom, I want to see the underlined.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.560]   I want to see the highlighting.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.920]   I want to see your notes.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.120]   And I want you to tell me what that actually did to change your way of thinking
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.720]   and change your way of behaving today.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.080]   That's Lectio Divina.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.800]   Wow. It's not audible at 2x.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.200]   No, not no.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.080]   You know, that is so Silicon Valley, man.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.800]   That is so absolutely true.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   Is that I'm reading to harvest information
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.720]   so that I can use it for money, power, pleasure and fame.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.120]   Hugely problematic.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.600]   We got way off track, and I think if we were to try to come back,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.120]   the next thing would be about using the science of satisfaction.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.360]   Am I bringing us to the right place?
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.440]   Sure, absolutely.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.960]   The science of satisfaction really is back to dopamine.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's the success addict is the one who keeps hitting the lever
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.240]   because they think they're going to get satisfaction.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.920]   And Mick Jagger saying, I don't get no satisfaction,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.400]   which is a super famous song.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.200]   It's the third most popular rock and roll song of all time.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.240]   The reason is because it has a message that people can really relate to.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.080]   I try and I try and I try and consumer culture and sex and all that.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.920]   But I can't get no satisfaction.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.200]   The truth is you can get satisfaction, but you can't keep no satisfaction
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.160]   because dopamine won't let you.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.080]   Here's the concept for the moment.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.960]   Every five minutes, we cycle through some really heavy thing here on this.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.440]   I love this conversation, by the way.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   You know, you're fast, man.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.040]   So the concept is homeostasis.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.560]   Homeostasis is the natural tendency of the brain
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.040]   to return all physical and mental processes to equilibrium.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.840]   For example, you get on the treadmill in the morning and you're running
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.400]   to get your heart rate up to 160.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   You step off 15 minutes later, your heart rate is back down to 80 or 70
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.280]   or whatever happens to be.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.560]   If it didn't, you die.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.040]   Homeostasis returns you to baseline.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.880]   It also returns you emotionally to baseline.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.680]   Something really great happens to you.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   Your book is a bestseller.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.520]   Congratulations.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.480]   One week from now, you're not going to feel a thing.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.040]   Why? Because you can't stay on that high forever.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.160]   You die.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.760]   In ancient times, you'd be like, I found some tasty berries on a bush
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.040]   and I'm going to be permanently happy
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.080]   while the saber tooth tiger sneaks up behind you and eats you for lunch.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.520]   You need to have emotions to guide your behavior, but you got to go back
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.040]   to the baseline to be ready for the next set of circumstances.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.400]   That's the reason you can't keep satisfaction in life.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.920]   You hit the lever and you think it'll stay forever and it doesn't.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.000]   It stays for a minute or a day
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.160]   or if it's something really, really great, a week or a month.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   So the science of satisfaction says you can't keep it.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.480]   And so therefore, you shouldn't tie your bliss to the idea
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.240]   that you can by running from thing to thing to thing.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.200]   And the happiest old people have got this figured out.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.600]   The happiest old people are no longer chained to the happiness wheel.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.880]   We call it the hedonic treadmill where you run and run and run.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.000]   The thing is running against you.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.440]   And there's a little evil guy in the corner turning up the speed.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.520]   And after a while, you're running out of fear
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.120]   because if you stop on a treadmill, boom, face plant.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.600]   This is the very important thing that old people figure out
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.000]   and they step off the hedonic treadmill.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.520]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact,
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.240]   and trade coffee is a great addition to your New Year routine.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.840]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.280]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.200]   that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.360]   and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.520]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.720]   so you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.680]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.880]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.680]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.960]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.480]   exactly when we need it.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.160]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.320]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.240]   it's called Bark the Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.800]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.840]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.320]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.880]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.440]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.640]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.800]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.000]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.400]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.520]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.040]   of microwave cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert,
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.240]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.360]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.200]   from scratch in the microwave.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.240]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.720]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.840]   The cookware is 100% plastic free, and you can cook, serve,
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.640]   store and reheat all in the same dish.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.320]   That happens to be dishwasher, freezer and oven safe, too.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.760]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.560]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.480]   It is so good.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.880]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black I/O collection
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.520]   they launched last year, you have to check it out.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.280]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.720]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.800]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.680]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.400]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals and discounts from our partners,
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.600]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.000]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.160]   Is the hedonic treadmill similar to the concept of keeping up
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.240]   with the Joneses in our financial or cultural lives?
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.360]   It's related.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.000]   That's actually a phenomenon called social comparison.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.240]   The great philosopher, President Theodore Roosevelt,
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.840]   called social comparison the thief of joy unambiguously.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.240]   Social comparison will wipe out your happiness.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.560]   It will mow down your joy.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.560]   That's the reason that social media is a misery machine.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.920]   It's based on social comparison and you're getting a fake version
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.280]   of somebody else's life,
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.880]   which you're comparing to the terrible version of your own life.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   Meanwhile, you're posting a fake version of your life.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.840]   B.S. That's not right.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.040]   And so the result of it is all fake, fictional social comparison.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.360]   And it makes you miserable.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.160]   So the hedonic treadmill is bad enough.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.720]   Lard on social comparison on top of that and misery is in the future.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.560]   Wow. People, when they're old, that are the most happy,
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.280]   have gotten off the treadmill. Yeah.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.800]   And I know you have a lot of opinions on bucket lists.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.480]   I interviewed a guy named Ben Nempton a few months ago,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.720]   who has written a lot about bucket lists.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   And his inspiration was reading research of people who on their deathbed
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.600]   said one of their regrets was not living the life they wanted to.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.240]   He has, through plenty of conversations, come to the conclusion
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.920]   that part of the reason people don't do the things they want
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.640]   is because they never take the time to write it down,
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.360]   write down how they want to get there.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.040]   And life just gets in the way.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.560]   So they don't do the things they care about.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.960]   So his answer was, I think people should create a list,
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.440]   not just of jump off a bungee jump in New Zealand, but things in their life,
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.920]   in their relationships, in their family, with their health,
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.320]   and write it down as a bucket list.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.040]   And I know you have some strong opinions about bucket lists.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.400]   So I'd love to hear your perspective on all that.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.000]   There's a lot that's right that you just said, but we have to be really careful.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.720]   Bucket lists, as we usually understand them, are metastatically
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.000]   stupid and misery provoking.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.440]   I want to go in a hot air balloon.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.480]   I want to make a million dollars.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.240]   I want to publish a self-help book.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   Basically, money, power, pleasure, honor, bucket list items.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.360]   Those are bad for you because what they do is they lower your satisfaction.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.760]   They increase your attachment.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.160]   They increase your craving.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.240]   And it grows around you like kudzu.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.760]   Your satisfaction is not a function of what you have.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.360]   Your satisfaction is a function of what you have divided by what you want.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.040]   Don't have a haves management strategy with a bunch of trivial bucket list items.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.440]   Have a wants management strategy of decreasing your worldly wants
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.320]   and your satisfaction will grow.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.440]   That's the reverse bucket list.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.280]   The reverse bucket list is to make a list of all of the tacky cravings.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:05.240]   I want the admiration of these strangers and I want this kind of car
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   and I want this glamorous vacation.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.200]   Write it all down.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.600]   Great. Write it all down and then say, I detach myself from this.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.120]   I officially no longer care about this.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.440]   The right thing in the bucket list that you're talking about
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.320]   is making a list of the good for faith, family, friends
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.320]   and work that serve other people.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.240]   Make a bucket list of those things.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.160]   So the love that I want to have, the relationship
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.480]   I want to have with my adult children, the relationship
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.360]   I want to establish with my parents and learn about them before they die.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.160]   Those are family items, the deep friendships.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.920]   I want to migrate all my deal friends to real friends
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.040]   because this is one of the great sources of unhappiness and loneliness.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.240]   That's a bucket list item is real friends.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.520]   That's actually meritorious.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.920]   Seeing how I can do work that truly serves other people who need me.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.240]   I want to go on a spiritual journey.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.280]   That's a bucket list item that's really meritorious.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.560]   So those are the things that actually should stay in the bucket
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.680]   and everything else should come right out.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.040]   So it's less about not having a bucket list
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.440]   and more about calling it down to the things that will matter.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.920]   And then it sounds like you and Ben, at least, would share
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.760]   that having them written down somewhere and talking about what you can do
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:13.280]   this week, this day to make progress towards them is a valuable exercise.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.960]   It's just not a valuable exercise.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.520]   If there's 300 things that include all kinds of crazy wants.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.760]   I know. Sure. Bunchy jumping in the Mekong Delta.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.200]   No, no. Getting to know my father better.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.640]   Yes. Yes, that's actually right.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.440]   So I think that he and I would agree to a very, very large extent.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.160]   A bucket list is not a bucket list is not a bucket list.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.920]   If you're filling your life with unsatisfied trivialities,
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.960]   all that's going to happen is you're going to wind up being less satisfied
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.440]   and unhappier than you were before.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.240]   There's been a common conversation about experiences
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.160]   like money should buy experiences because experiences is, you know,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.760]   the way to fulfill yourself and be satisfied and be happy.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.240]   But I think a little bit of what you just said contradicts that concept.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.200]   Yeah. So there's a lot of research on this.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.040]   And I have two colleagues at the Harvard Business School,
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.400]   Ashley Williams and Mike Norton.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.440]   They're kind of the leading experts on how to buy happiness.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.040]   And there's basically you can classify in different ways.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.520]   Some people say five, some people say six.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.080]   It's really four things you can do with happiness.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.040]   You can buy stuff, you can buy time, you can buy experiences
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.440]   and you can give it away.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.880]   Those kind of the big four ways that you can use money.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.600]   Now, what everybody wants to do for their satisfaction is they want to buy stuff
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.640]   because they think that's the most tangible, but that's not right.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.400]   Let me tell you a story.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.840]   So I've been married 30 years and 29 years ago.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.520]   I was having this great, big blowout, unbelievably bitter argument
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.800]   with my new wife, and we were arguing about how to celebrate
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.120]   our first wedding anniversary, ironically.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.560]   And here was the deal.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.440]   My wife's from Barcelona, and she's all about vacation, going to the beach.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.240]   And I'm a thrifty, practical American.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.840]   And we had zero money.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.040]   And so I thought we should buy a couch to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.840]   I was a musician and we just moved to the States from Spain,
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.960]   and she didn't speak English.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.360]   She's working a minimum wage job, and it was brutal.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.280]   And so this is the argument, beach, couch, beach, couch, beach, couch.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.320]   And finally, we compromised and went to the beach.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.480]   And that's why I've been married 30 years.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.720]   But that's not my point.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.800]   The key thing to remember is that we were talking about that a couple of years ago
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.600]   and we got a couch that was like seven couches ago or something.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.560]   And I don't even remember the couch.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.120]   But I can tell you everything we did on that beach vacation
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.160]   because we were in love and experiencing it together.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.320]   Here's the main mistake that people make.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:27.640]   They think that physical things are permanent and experiences are evanescent.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.920]   It's exactly the opposite.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.400]   Well, if you experience something with somebody you love, it's permanent.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.720]   But if you get a thing, you'll forget it and not care about it.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.560]   And it'll be out on the curve of your emotions almost immediately.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.200]   Buying stuff seems permanent and it will give you the satisfaction.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:44.920]   And you're wrong.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.920]   Your brain is lying to you.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.480]   And there's all kinds of evolutionary reasons why your brain is lying to you.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.320]   You need to go to the other three, but you got to do it in the right way.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.560]   Buying experiences is great, but you have to do that with someone you love.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.880]   Maybe the person that you love and you want to know better is you, by the way.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.640]   And if you really want to go to the Cambodian temples by yourself
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.040]   because you're actually trying to get in touch with something spiritually,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.040]   that's great. Fantastic.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.440]   But it has to be for a reason.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.360]   And the reason has to do with experiences and improvement
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.120]   of a particular relationship.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.000]   Second is buying time.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.920]   Buying time means paying somebody to do something you don't want to do.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.360]   Now, not everybody listening to us can do that because they don't have enough money.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.320]   But if you can, why would you pay somebody to cut your yard
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.920]   so you have more time to do something you do want with someone you love?
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.360]   If you do it so you can watch something stupid on Netflix,
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.720]   all you did is waste your time and your money.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.440]   And that's not so great.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.520]   The last is giving it away, but giving it away to a cause that you love.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.320]   It has to serve your values.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.160]   And you see what I'm talking about here, Chris.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.960]   It's love and then love and then love and then love.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.000]   You want to turn your money into happiness.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.040]   It has to be based on love.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.440]   I heard you say not to watch something on Netflix.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.160]   Would it be fair to say unless you watch something on Netflix,
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.600]   it's stupid with someone you love, then it's OK?
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.160]   Precisely. You've got it.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.680]   You're a plus student.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.240]   Find anything I'm not supposed to do.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.480]   As long as I do it with someone I love, then I can get around.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.880]   Yeah, this is the reason that neglecting your loved ones
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.240]   while scrolling social media is such a terrible thing for your happiness
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.080]   because you're doing two things at once.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.120]   Number one is you're numbing yourself
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:20.760]   with just a little shot of inadequate dopamine and your foregoing love.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.960]   It's crazy plus crazy.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.880]   That's an interesting point.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.880]   I have to assume that technology has made a lot of building happiness
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.960]   in our lives difficult because of distraction or social comparison.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.000]   Is there anything it's done to make happiness easier?
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Yeah. So here's the key thing about technology.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.080]   It always over promises and under delivers.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.200]   And I'm not a Luddite.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.600]   On the contrary, I think this stuff is really great.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.120]   Anything that substitutes for love will make you unhappier.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.080]   Anything that complements your love will make you happier.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.160]   All of the technologies, what do they promise?
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.400]   It promises you more love, and that's why you want it.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.960]   I'm going to connect with people.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.680]   I'm going to get social contact.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.760]   I'm going to meet people.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.560]   Phenomenal. It looks really great.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:05.360]   But almost inevitably, it actually crowds out true human experience.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.440]   The experience of getting to know somebody, to share your heart with somebody.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.760]   Now, there's a lot of neurophysiology to this.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.680]   For example, a neuropeptide that functions as a hormone in the brain
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.240]   called oxytocin.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.720]   This is intensely pleasurable that we get in response to eye contact and touch.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.320]   With other people, when people are really lonely,
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.360]   they do exactly the opposite of what they should do.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.120]   Instead of going someplace and talking to somebody in person,
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.440]   they scroll social media, which gives you no oxytocin.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.160]   It makes you lonelier.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.880]   Social media is the junk food of social life and apps for dating.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.960]   What they do is they crowd out the experience of meeting somebody de novo.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.080]   They also have another big problem, which is that they don't give you
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   enough complementarity with other people and they overload on compatibility.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.440]   They make you so compatible as you're dating your sibling,
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.800]   which is, how shall we say, not hot.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.520]   This is a problem with how technology works.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.560]   So here's the way to judge technology.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.840]   Is it a complement to my relationships, my real in-person,
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.640]   human loving relationships, or is this a substitute for those relationships?
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.760]   If it's the latter, it's bad for you.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.960]   I want to jump to one last section, which was about turning weakness into strength.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.080]   Yeah. And I want to hear a little bit about that because I have some questions.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.640]   Yeah, I know that's a scary one, man.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.600]   But this is a skill that all happy old people have in common.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.760]   That's really hard for young people to absorb.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.840]   And once again, what's this book all about?
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.120]   This is the happiness 401k, meaning that these are the kinds of investments
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.480]   we need to start making at 25 or 45 or 65 so they'll pay off later.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.240]   So it's very important to understand these things from the very beginning.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.960]   Old people all know that what's really off putting is saying
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.280]   that you don't have strengths and being defensive about your weaknesses.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.080]   I could come and be wearing an obvious toupee right now.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.040]   And I'd be like, I think it looks pretty natural.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.560]   And you'd be like, that thing looks like a bird's nest.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.840]   Are you kidding me?
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.320]   And it would be ridiculous.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.040]   And it would be a sign of defensiveness and insecurity.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.320]   And that's the problem, because life tells you if you've got a weakness,
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.280]   you should not share it.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.560]   You should defend yourself against it.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.800]   You should hide it, as a matter of fact.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.400]   And that's actually a huge mistake.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.120]   What we need is human connection.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.280]   And your weaknesses connect you with other people.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.680]   We're all weak.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.720]   You have good things about you that people admire.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.560]   And that's magnetic, too, to be sure.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.440]   But if you really want to relate to somebody,
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.040]   you've got to lead with the ways that you are like other people.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.360]   And that's what old people do.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.320]   I was a musician for a long time, and it really hurt my hearing
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.760]   because it's very loud playing in a symphony orchestra.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.480]   And now I don't have hearing aids, but I'm getting a little deaf, quite frankly.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.680]   And I'm in lecture.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.800]   And these kids, they fricking whisper.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.320]   You can't hear a word they're saying.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.240]   So I'm like, what? What?
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.240]   I said, so I asked my colleague, one of my colleagues, like, what do I do?
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.640]   And he's like, you say, hey, I'm fifty seven.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   I'm deaf. Speak up.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.720]   And it's hilarious.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.040]   They all laugh and they can actually relate to you and they like you better.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.040]   And they speak louder.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.520]   So you see what I'm saying, right?
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.360]   The connection is human frailty.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.880]   And this is what we need to do.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.880]   The most winsome people are non-defensive about their humanity.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.720]   They're not hiding things.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.600]   They know what they do well and they know what they do poorly.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.360]   And it's all good.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.400]   You said in the book, negative emotions make us more effective
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.880]   in our day to day activities.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.840]   Yeah. Without negative emotions and experiences, we don't learn
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.520]   and we don't learn, we don't find meaning and purpose.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.480]   So when people are trying to go from happy feeling to happy feeling to happy feeling
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.520]   and they're trying to force unhappiness out of their life, paradoxically,
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.320]   they're actually avoiding their happiness
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.600]   because they're not getting sufficient meaning and purpose.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.680]   That doesn't mean we should go looking for suffering,
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.640]   but suffering is going to find us and we need to find ways
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.400]   to experience it and learn from it.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.640]   Is that an indirect argument against being eternally optimistic?
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.760]   It's a common argument in our household.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.680]   It's like circumstance arises.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.920]   You could think of glass half full, glass half empty.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.080]   My wife and I often take different sides of that.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.280]   And it's a little frustrating.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.560]   And I read that line about negative emotions.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.720]   And I thought, maybe sometimes you should take glass half empty.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.240]   Maybe it's better. Or am I misinterpreting?
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.480]   You know, it's absolutely the case.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.760]   So my great mentor and friend, Martin Seligman, he talks about rational optimism,
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.880]   but what he's really talking about is hope.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.000]   People often use them synonymously.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.080]   But optimism is really just a prediction that everything will be OK.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.760]   Hope, there's nothing unrealistic about it.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.160]   It's the idea that something can be done to improve the situation and I can do it.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.760]   It's hugely empowering.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.240]   There's always a reason for hope.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.760]   Hope is a theological virtue in Christianity and Judaism.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.480]   Hope is a good thing. It's a good way to be.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.520]   It'll make you happier.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.320]   And it's a virtuous way to be as well.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.720]   It's better to be realistic and to do what's appropriate and to do so with hope.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.040]   So that's the distinction that I would make.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.520]   So I got a few rapid fire things before we wrap up.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.880]   I know you have talked in the past about how you had this amazing job
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.320]   and then you thought about happiness and you decided to quit.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.360]   People in their 20s and 30s, they're working a job.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:57.320]   They don't love it, but they know that for some reason,
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:02.040]   sticking it out for a little bit of time, maybe not forever, will bring something,
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.880]   whether it's they'll hit their bonus six months from now
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.520]   and that'll give them some comfort with their financial situation
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.480]   or they'll get that promotion.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.800]   And I'm curious if you think is the answer that sometimes, yes, that's the case
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.600]   or is the answer always you should probably cut bait
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.360]   as soon as you feel like it's not a good fit?
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.040]   It really depends on the circumstances.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:24.040]   I know all kinds of cases where couples are not getting along,
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.960]   but they want their marriage to work.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:29.800]   You need to think ahead about exactly what the circumstances are
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.920]   and whether you know something can be fixed.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.760]   And it's perfectly legitimate to suffer through circumstances
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.400]   you don't like in the moment because there's a greater prize.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.600]   It's also the case that quitting a job every time you don't like it
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   is a lost opportunity for you to prosper.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.160]   It's a lost opportunity for you to grow as well, too.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.600]   The biggest mistake I see for young people, and this is a very practical thing
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.920]   that I tell my students, is if you quit a job like your first job at a college,
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.960]   usually within 18 months, you're probably making an error
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.880]   because you're incapable of learning to like it
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.960]   when you change jobs and careers and cities all at the same time.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.440]   That is the same cognitive and emotional impact as immediate family member dying.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.760]   So what happens is people like, congratulations,
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.960]   but you're actually grieving because there's so much change in your life
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.360]   and you tend to cross the cables in your mind.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.440]   And you think that the change per se, the grief that you're feeling
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.720]   is because you made an incorrect decision.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.040]   That's wrong.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.400]   And so there are all kinds of ways to stay the course.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.720]   Now, that doesn't mean you should be like, I hate this job.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.800]   My life sucks.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.080]   But 25 years from now, I'm going to get a pension.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.120]   So I'm going to stick with it.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.680]   That's an error.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.320]   OK, you've lived in a lot of places.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.960]   I'll give you the freedom to pick anywhere you've lived and tell people
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.400]   if they're going to that place, what's that kind of off
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.360]   the beaten recommendation for a meal, a drink and something to do?
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.160]   My favorite city in the world is Barcelona,
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.560]   which has been my second home for the past 35 years.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.800]   That's where I got married.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.480]   That's where I played in the symphony orchestra.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.360]   I consider that my own home and it's the city that I actually know best.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.920]   So where are you going to eat any place?
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.040]   It's Barcelona.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.400]   It's one of the foodie capitals of the world.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.240]   You go to a bar and you eat some bar food.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.160]   You can be like the best thing I've ever had.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.000]   What are you going to drink?
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.280]   I don't know. I don't drink at all, but live it up.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.240]   That's all I can say. It's Barcelona.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.000]   And what are you going to see as a tourist?
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.600]   Oh, man, throw a dart.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.560]   Place is unbelievable.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.760]   You can go to the Roman ruins.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.160]   You can go to the Sagrada Familia.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.480]   You can go to the ancient Romanesque churches.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.760]   You can look at the Gothic cathedrals.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.720]   Holy cow.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.080]   It's just like a living, walking museum
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   of everything from modernism all the way back to prehistoric times.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.040]   And so go to Barcelona, everybody.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.840]   If you haven't been to Barcelona yet, you're barely living.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.240]   I have been for only a few days, but it's on the list to go back.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.520]   There's a story you open the book with that I know in a lot of interviews
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:50.000]   you started with, but I figure we should end on it, which is your situation
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.080]   on an airplane that kind of inspired you to write the book.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.720]   Yeah, the great thing about being a social scientist is that the world
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.320]   is my laboratory and all the research is actually me search.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   That's actually the dirty secret of being a happiness specialist.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.480]   And every time I start on a brand new project, it usually comes
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.160]   because I have an experience that really affects me.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.120]   And that's actually where the story started.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.480]   Eight years ago or so, I was on a flight, night flight from L.A.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.560]   to Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.800]   And I heard a couple talking behind me on the plane.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.800]   I could hear them.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.720]   It sounded like a married couple, a man and a woman, and they sounded old.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.520]   Their voices were elderly.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.000]   And I couldn't quite make out the husband's words, but I can tell
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.400]   by his wife's comments that this was serious business.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.160]   She was consoling him and saying, oh, it's not true
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.800]   that it would be better if you were dead.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.280]   It's not true that people don't love you and respect you,
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.520]   that everybody's forgotten you.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.880]   It's like this went on for 20 minutes and it was just it was brutal.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   So their flight finally ends and they turn on the lights.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.840]   And I'm curious and I'm a student of human behavior.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.560]   This is probably somebody who's disappointed with his life
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.600]   because he didn't live up to his own dreams.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.160]   And I stood up and turned around.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.920]   It was one of the most famous men in the world.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.480]   This is somebody who's achieved 10 times what I will in my life.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.440]   I would die to be this guy.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.080]   So it seems.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.640]   And if I did, I'd dine out on my success for the rest of my life.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   His feats of heroism are decades in the past, but still he's rich.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.120]   He's famous. He's got it all.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.680]   I thought something's up here.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.280]   This is no insurance policy that what the world tells you,
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.000]   that you get successful and you can bank it and enjoy it for the rest of your life.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.440]   That's a lie.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.960]   That's an obvious lie.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.160]   So what's the deal?
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.840]   Is he an outlier or is he typical?
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:25.280]   Are the strivers the ones who tend to suffer or is he just have some mood disorder?
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.160]   And that's what started this investigation on what we can all do
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.400]   to invest in our happiness later in life.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.640]   They came up with a lot of the stuff
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.840]   that we're talking about today was that poor man on the plane.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.800]   And I still look him up and I pray for him.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.760]   I hope for the best.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.160]   That's all I can say.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.480]   I, for one, am fortunate you had that experience
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.000]   because it led you to all this research, led you to the book.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.920]   I think I'll be a happier person in the future because of it.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.160]   So thank you.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.040]   Where can anyone here other than by the book
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.160]   follow up with what you're doing and stay in touch?
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.200]   So I have a column every week in the Atlantic called
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.720]   How to Build a Life every Thursday morning in the Atlantic.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.840]   And if you want to see just all the different essays and books
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.200]   and things that I write about happiness and even learn about my classes
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.760]   at Harvard, you go to Arthur Brooks dot com, all the information's there.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.720]   Perfect. We'll link to everything in the show notes.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.200]   And thank you so much for being here.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.840]   Thank you, Chris. Thanks for what you're doing.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:16.800]   You're making me happy, too.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.120]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.920]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.080]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:28.200]   for the show in Apple podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.200]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me or just want to say hi.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.320]   I'm Chris at all the hacks dot com or at Hutchins on Twitter.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.600]   That's it for this week. I'll see you next week.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:59.080]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.840]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.000]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.440]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.960]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:17.000]   It's hosted by my good friend Andrew, who truly believes that everyone
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.520]   in this world can build wealth.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.280]   And his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:26.200]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.800]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.160]   that will blow your mind.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.720]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35 percent of millennials
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.520]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.160]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.160]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.760]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.720]   with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.720]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.760]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcast, Spotify
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.360]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
