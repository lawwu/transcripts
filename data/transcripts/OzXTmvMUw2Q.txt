[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.320]   All right, well, speaking of getting after it,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.680]   let's do some listener calls.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.280]   So who do we have here first?
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.800]   - All right, so our first call is from Jeff.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.960]   Basically has a deep life question.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.680]   He wants an example from you, so we'll take a listen,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.380]   see what he has to say.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.040]   - Hi Cal, my name is Jeff and I am an IT consultant.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.760]   I've been a big fan of yours ever since,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.900]   so good they can't ignore you.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.600]   And I've read similar books such as "Ultra Learning",
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.360]   "Peak Performance", "Grit" and "Atomic Habits".
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.760]   These books are full of practical advice
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.560]   on how to improve learning and skills
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.140]   and contribute to the deep life.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.080]   However, I find myself never implementing them.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.800]   What kind of strategy would you suggest using
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.480]   to incorporate concepts found in books of this genre?
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.400]   How long should one try something new
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400]   before deciding it doesn't work for them?
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.600]   And I think it would be great if you can give an example
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.240]   of a habit or advice you once read about
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.040]   and then incorporated into your daily life.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.880]   Thank you.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.120]   - So Jeff, the systematic advice I give
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.080]   for laying the foundation for a deep life,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.360]   integrating new ideas into the deep life
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   is based on the deep life buckets.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.580]   I think that's exactly what you need
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700]   for what you're talking about here.
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.520]   You define the different areas that are important
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.080]   to you living a life well lived.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.320]   We call these the deep life buckets.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.880]   The standard examples we give, for example,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.960]   is craft, which is the things you produce,
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.820]   your work, the things you build.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760]   Constitution, which is your health and fitness.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.240]   Community, your connection to people
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.300]   that are around you and that matter to you.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.120]   And contemplation, theology, ethics and philosophy.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.320]   Just as a starting point, but you have your areas
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440]   that are important to you.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.320]   Then you wanna have a keystone habit
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.160]   in each of these areas, something you do every day.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.360]   So this is where when you learn new things,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.320]   could be integrated into what this keystone habit is.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.640]   And that's a warmup.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.680]   So now you say, okay, I'm in the habit
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.280]   of doing optional activity in each of the areas
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.180]   of my life that are important on a regular basis,
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.420]   even though I don't have to.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.520]   So you're signaling to yourself,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.560]   I take these parts of my life seriously.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.340]   Then you dedicate four to six weeks
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.080]   to each of these buckets, one by one,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.120]   to say, now I'm gonna do a more systematic overhaul
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   of that part of my life, where I might remove
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.840]   multiple things out of my life related to that bucket
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.200]   that are just in the way, that are cluttered,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.760]   that are taking up time, streamline,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.880]   and then I might add into it or refine the things I do
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.840]   in that part of my life so I get a maximum value return.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.640]   So it's all about focusing on things that are high return
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.660]   and avoiding the things that don't give you much return
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.640]   or get in the way.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.180]   That is exactly where you can be integrating new advice.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.520]   So just do this once a year.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.080]   I suggest doing it in the lead up to your birthday.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.920]   That's the way I like to think about this.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.360]   You're doing an overhaul in the months
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.400]   leading up to your birthday, and that's where you can
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.080]   look at what's working, what's not working
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.720]   in each of the areas of your life,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.700]   integrate new ideas, integrate new systems,
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.600]   integrate new habits.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   That's what I would recommend.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.360]   All right, in terms of examples from my own life,
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.160]   things that I've integrated or not integrated.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.760]   Let me think about that.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.240]   I'm thinking in my mind, if you wanna know
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.800]   what's going on here, I'm thinking through my mind
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.200]   in different categories.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   You know, like I've had a pretty major constitution,
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.400]   so health and fitness overhaul, I do those, you know,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040]   every once in a while, and I've done,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.800]   I put a lot of time into that, so I gave it
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.960]   its four to six week focus to overhaul somewhat recently.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.400]   And so there's a few things I do.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.280]   So the keystone habit, the keystone habit I do now
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.160]   is there's a tracking habit where I track the,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.520]   as I've done before, the exercise I do,
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.360]   like what did I do today, and the steps I take.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.560]   I had been doing that.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.760]   I added to it weight every morning.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.640]   You gotta look at it, look at the number,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.740]   and that's, you know, you gotta face it.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.240]   Best motivator is a very powerful keystone habit.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.600]   You have to face it, and you know you have to face it,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.440]   and it can really keep you away from, you know,
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   I should not be eating this or drinking this as much,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.800]   and so that was a keystone habit.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.640]   Then I've had a pretty radical overhaul
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.480]   in terms of my actual fitness.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.240]   I'm going through a rowing program.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.720]   I have a Concept2 Rower, and the stave off,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.960]   the winter, can't be outside as much,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.600]   blues, and not get as much sunshine, blues.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.280]   I have a daily, it's a daily rowing program,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.920]   where it's every day, here's the workout you're doing,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.800]   here's the workout you're doing.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.400]   So that gives me flashbacks from my old college crew days.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.440]   I've replaced, I always have a baseline
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.840]   of doing 1,000 pull-ups a month,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.360]   but I've now added into it,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.280]   I think I have that right, 1,000, yeah, 36.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.540]   Am I doing that math right, Jesse?
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.080]   36 a day.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.920]   - That's all.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.560]   - Yeah, and I've always done that,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.560]   but now I'm actually doing workout routines beyond that.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.460]   But let me tell you, just to walk you through this,
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.360]   to me, that's all just breaking the seal.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.560]   So this was what I was gonna be doing in January.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.900]   I'm doing it now January through February
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.540]   because I hurt my back in January, so I got a slow start.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.560]   I'm just breaking the seal.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   I'm getting used to, like, I'm doing a rowing workout,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.280]   I'm getting used to doing real workouts
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.120]   beyond just my pull-ups or whatever.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.040]   All of that is just to get me used to that
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.560]   being a non-trivial part of my life
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.640]   so that then I can upgrade that
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.760]   when we get later in February.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   And so now I wanna do some serious training.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.400]   But I didn't wanna jump straight into serious training.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.240]   I figured I had to overhaul my life
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.120]   to that that's a big part of my day,
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.080]   and I'm used to it, and I'm in that groove,
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.320]   and I'm doing hard work every day,
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.800]   somewhat randomly, but I'm doing it, right?
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.720]   And then when I'm done doing that for a month or two,
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.680]   then I'm gonna say, "Now I can up my game."
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.520]   And actually, Jeff, my idea is I wanna train for something,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.160]   and I don't know what yet,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.660]   but that is an example of deep life thinking.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.980]   That's me focusing on the Constitution bucket.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.140]   So I'm turning 40 this summer,
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.720]   and I figure I really gotta start caring
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.880]   about my health and fitness more
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.720]   because that's the age for men where a lot of things,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.560]   a lot of things go downhill.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.080]   And so there's a high leverage moment
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.920]   to be in really good shape.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.440]   And so that's, I made that whole overhaul plan,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.680]   and that's just for the Constitution bucket.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.120]   And now that plan's kinda operating,
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.280]   so now I can, there's other buckets I could think about.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.720]   That's an example of what those overhauls look like.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.680]   I should get your advice.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.840]   So when the time comes, Jesse, I'll get your advice.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.640]   Jesse knows about gyms and exercise, so he'll get me.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.600]   That's what we should do with the HQ.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.240]   Should we just have it be essentially like a gym?
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.240]   That'd be weird.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   - We could put a pull-up bar in.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.400]   - We should put a pull-up bar in.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.220]   - That'd be cool.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.800]   You could just put one right in the door.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.040]   - Can I tell you something about pull-up bars,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.760]   those ones you just put in the doors
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.480]   that are supposed to somehow like counter,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.440]   just counter-lever in and you can use them?
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.200]   I've never in my life got that to work.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.280]   - Really? I have one at my house.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.120]   I've had it forever. It works.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.160]   - Where it just like, there's no screws or anything.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.000]   It just, I must be doing it wrong.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.840]   - Yeah, it works great.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.720]   I've had it for years.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.640]   - I must be doing it wrong
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.000]   because I've had multiple of these
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.600]   because I've been doing pull-ups ever since I was,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.880]   you know, left 22 and left college.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.480]   It was a rowing thing, right?
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.420]   I've never got it to work.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.620]   I'm like, there's no way this is going to work.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.440]   I put it up there and it just drops to the ground.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.760]   Like, how am I supposed to do pull-ups on this thing?
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.720]   I'm doing something wrong.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.160]   All right, we got to figure that out.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.080]   We will start doing pull-ups here.
