[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 8.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.920]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.480]   Today's show is going to be a conversation.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.520]   I want to give you an update on the show, an update on some of the technological components
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.560]   of the show, and then I want to give you a little bit of a vision into some of the ideas
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.520]   and some of the places where I'm hoping that this show will go.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.520]   Thank you for listening this morning.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.320]   I hope you enjoy this morning's show.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.400]   I'm going to walk through a couple of ideas that are compelling to me.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.560]   First of all, updates on the show.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880]   Thank you so much to those of you who are listening.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.200]   I've been having a blast putting this thing together.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   Be patient with me.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.120]   I'm learning as I go.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.800]   There are so many things that need to be done for this show, and I'm doing them little by
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.320]   little just to give you a little insight into what's going on with the show.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.640]   Trying to get some of the technological stuff worked out.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.400]   Finally got the logo updated and put into iTunes.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.040]   That feels good to get done.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.180]   I know I've got lots of work to do.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.600]   One of the things that's on my list of things to do is figure out how to improve my audio
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600]   quality.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.560]   I need to get a better microphone set up.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.960]   I will do that as soon as I'm able to.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.440]   I also need to bring, I'm hoping to bring a little bit more professionalism to the,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.000]   bring in some theme music and some of the intros and the outros and things that make
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.120]   these types of podcasts more interesting to listen to.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.220]   I'm learning as I go.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.920]   First of all, I hope that that's not too big of a turn off for most people.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.960]   I personally love consuming podcasts and I enjoy the ones that are incredibly professionally
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   well done.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.920]   I think that's awesome and I hope to get this show to that level in the future.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.680]   But I also enjoy great content talking about great ideas and I hope that today I can provide
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.240]   some great content and talk about good ideas.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.640]   And I hope this can be valuable for you.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.960]   I hope you enjoy the interviews that I've been doing.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.280]   I hope some of the ideas and things that we discussed and the education is helpful.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.720]   So I'll try to provide great content and then improve the production quality over time.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.480]   I'm learning as I go as well.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   It's interesting.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.840]   I'm learning what to do and what not to do.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.040]   I was listening the other day to one of my shows that I recorded last week and many of
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.320]   these shows, most of these shows, I'm recording them early in the morning.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.360]   For example, at this moment as I record this, it's 4.59 AM and I get up and do these about
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360]   four in the morning.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.320]   I listened to one of the shows the other day and right at the beginning I was, I couldn't,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.240]   I could hardly stand the first 30 to 60 seconds of it because I was speaking so slowly and
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.480]   the reason was that I was recording it at about 4.06 AM and I had woken up at four.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.240]   I was just sitting down with my first cup of coffee and I would start hit record and
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.920]   I said I got to get the show done.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.080]   As I started recording I realized it's not good to record at 4.00 AM.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.240]   I need some time to wake up, get a couple of cups of coffee, get my energy level up.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.920]   I was, it was boring and slow to listen to so stick with me.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.120]   I'll learn how to do this quickly and better as time goes on.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.240]   So this morning I waited an hour and worked on some other stuff, got my mind cranking,
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.440]   got my creative juices flowing and have a couple of coffees.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.400]   I have a couple of cups of coffee.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   You'll hear me often times if I pause for a moment and take a sip of coffee.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   I hope it's not too annoying but definitely doing that.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.940]   Coffee makes me think better in the morning.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.560]   So this morning I want to talk about some of the connecting themes.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:07.360]   As I build this show out, as I've stated in previous episodes, I'm running a balance in
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.040]   my head of how much to, of the type of content to bring you.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.080]   I don't want to just bring, you know, this show is called Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.720]   I'm going to bring you technical content that I hope is interesting and educational but
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.920]   I don't want this to be the financial planning textbook show.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.040]   It's way too boring.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.520]   But on the other hand I don't want it to all be fluffy so I'm trying to run a balance between
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   those two things.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.520]   And I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to strike the balance.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.480]   I've got some shows planned about some fundamentals that I think are valuable, fundamentals of
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   financial planning.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.440]   And I've also got lots of philosophical concepts and ideas and things that occur to me that
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.720]   seem like smarter ways to do things.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.400]   So kind of winging it as we go forward over the coming days, weeks and months.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.680]   And I hope that this content ultimately becomes coherent and cohesive but just working on
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.520]   it as it goes.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.440]   As far as the interviews, there are going to be interviews, my plan, from all across
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.760]   the spectrum.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.960]   From people who are just killing it, doing awesome.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.280]   People who are struggling.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.000]   People who have achieved all their goals.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.760]   People who are just getting started.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.080]   People with radically diverse and different backgrounds.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.160]   I'm doing that intentionally and I'm hoping that as time goes forward that speaking with
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.920]   other people and hearing their story and hearing about the things that they're doing and their
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.080]   successes and their failures will help you figure out what's right for your financial
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.920]   plan.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.880]   I find that just learning from other people's experiences is so valuable.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.640]   It's wise to learn from our own experiences and not repeat our own mistakes again and
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.600]   again but it's so much wiser I think to learn from other people's experiences.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.080]   Why repeat all the mistakes that they've made?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.640]   Why not simply learn from the things they've done well and the things that they've done
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   poorly?
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.480]   After all, that's why we have parents in the initial stages of our life to guide us
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.320]   through the pitfalls and the traps that are available for us.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.680]   Also by learning from other people's experiences we can have hope and encouragement when we
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.760]   see people that are facing more difficult circumstances than us and we hear their thoughts
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   and their attitudes and that encourages us when we're struggling.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.400]   Then also when we hear people that are struggling that helps us to realize that it builds empathy
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.360]   in our hearts where our hearts go out to other people and we can reach out to them and realize
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.640]   that our own situation is probably pretty good.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.040]   We can try to look to how to encourage them.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.680]   The human heart is one that when we're encouraging others that helps us to be encouraged ourselves.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.560]   I'm also trying to figure out how to balance the tone between my ideas and the things that
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:22.720]   I'm interested in for my personal life and being objective.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.120]   I don't know how to strike this balance so bear with me as I learn.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:35.000]   I think that what I love about the world of podcasting is the authenticity of a host.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.340]   I love being able to listen to somebody and understand who they really are and have it
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:50.280]   come out unfiltered by the 11 minute segment on commercial radio and unfiltered by the
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.840]   polished professionalism of the show.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.400]   To me that's a major benefit of podcasting but on the other hand I don't want to just
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.960]   be hammered sometimes with a host's opinion on something.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.640]   My opinions are going to change over time so I also think that if we're just purely
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.460]   doing opinion shows and things like that, that can be a bit pigeonholing.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.440]   But this morning I am going to share some of my opinions and some of the things that
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.320]   I look at.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.120]   Some of this is going to include my dreams, my ideas and these things are largely in flux.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.520]   You'll get a concept of this morning a little bit more of who I am and the types of things
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.400]   that I'm into.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.200]   I hope that it's helpful and I hope that it challenges you.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.160]   I hope that some of the ideas that I talk about are ideas that frankly when you hear
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.120]   them they grate against you because they're out of the ordinary.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   To me that's good.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.800]   That means that those ideas will germinate and you'll figure out maybe some variation
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.080]   of that idea and it might be helpful to you.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:04.380]   Again, this is the Radical Personal Finance, not the mainstream personal finance show.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:12.400]   When I look also with respect to all of the international listeners that we do have and
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.200]   I'm sure we will have in the future, I live in the United States of America and this show
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   will have a US-American focus but I don't think that the concepts are only able to be
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.280]   implemented in the US-American context.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.200]   It's just that this is what I know best even though I've been privileged to travel more
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.080]   than many people.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.600]   Each culture is unique and you can't necessarily apply what works in one culture to another
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:46.640]   but you can apply kind of a similar design process to multiple cultures.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:55.440]   When I look at US-American society I see so many things that are just wonderful.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:02.000]   I am a diehard optimist.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.400]   This may sound like a contradiction but I promise it's not so hear me out.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.840]   I am a diehard optimist.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.680]   I believe that's fact-based.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:18.440]   It's not coming just simply from some pull the wool over my eyes and look to see what
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:24.640]   -- and look to see -- it's not let me blind myself to the facts.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.200]   By looking at the facts I am a diehard optimist.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.120]   Here's what I mean.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.960]   I believe that things have never been -- life has never been better in the United States
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.560]   of America than it is now.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.880]   Now if that statement shocks you I'll get to the flip side because in many ways I think
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.920]   that life has never been worse than it is now but hear me out.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:56.840]   There's never been a time in the history of the universe where opportunity has been greater,
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.360]   freedom has been greater, technology has given more access to information that can be life
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   changing than right now.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.320]   Wealth in the United States of America is extremely high.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.480]   Opportunity is extremely high.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:20.840]   Without question some of the ancient barriers that keep people divided whether that's religion
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:29.600]   or race or any of those things that keep people divided those walls are lower than they've
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.840]   ever been.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.880]   Technology has been an incredible game changer.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:44.920]   Even though the far-reaching scope of government gets consistently larger and larger freedom,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.320]   personal freedom is incredibly high.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.520]   This is going to sound like a cliche but the internet has been absolutely just a phenomenon
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.120]   that has changed every aspect of society and is just getting started.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.840]   It's an absolute baby.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.800]   There's more technology in the cell phone on your hip than existed in the world when
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.900]   they put a man on the moon.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.720]   Think about how great the future is.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.400]   Think about the wonderful ways that we can apply these technologies to the future.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:29.560]   On the same hand, even though I believe that the facts show that life spans are longer,
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.600]   we know more about the working of the human body, more and more people are coming out
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:43.000]   of poverty all around the world, millions of people coming out of poverty in formerly
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.360]   extremely poor countries.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.400]   Now there are still millions and millions of people in poverty but those people are
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   coming out.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   Innovation is high.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:59.480]   In the United States of America, what's a person who is defined as poor, those definitions
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:06.560]   of poor are better than a poor person in the United States of America today usually has
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.000]   according to the government data line and the numbers that they use.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.460]   A poor person usually generally has a place to live in that's reasonably safe, transportation
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:25.880]   that's amazing, color television, air conditioning.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.680]   Go back to the richest person in the world 100 years ago, 200 years ago.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.400]   The richest person in the world couldn't buy air conditioning, couldn't buy entertainment
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.880]   from all over the world, couldn't buy instant access to information and education and inspiration
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.720]   and now it's freely available, absolutely 100% free down at the local library.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.100]   The knowledge of the world at any person's fingertips.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:14:00.080]   So with the tools that we have now, money is becoming less and less relevant as a barrier
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.960]   to people's learning.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.080]   Think about the breadth of experience that comes from the internet.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.680]   Think about the fact that somebody, pretend you're homeless and you don't have a dollar.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.640]   Think about the fact that today you can walk into any public library, every public library
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:26.400]   that I'm aware of has today a large bank of computers that are available for the use,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.280]   completely for free.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:35.800]   Run into a computer, get a pair of headphones, you can pull up a free online, you can pull
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:42.340]   up YouTube and access information from all around the world, free.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.480]   You can see what somebody in China is doing, filming it on their iPhone and putting it
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   on YouTube.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.400]   That's incredible, absolutely incredible.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.120]   And a lot of times all this information to me doesn't seem like it's being applied
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.360]   as efficiently as it could be.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.040]   Now I'm more optimistic about the future than I ever have been, but at the same hand, look
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:15.320]   at the reality of the current situation and we're not applying the technology as broadly
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.400]   as we could to improve our situation.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.120]   Financial stress is high.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.560]   Why is financial stress in our country so high?
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.080]   Why do many people live paycheck to paycheck?
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.160]   Well, obviously there's lots of reasons.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.720]   Part of it could just be that no one's taught them how to not live paycheck to paycheck.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.600]   Part of it could be that their circumstances seem overwhelming.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.220]   Part of it could be that their income is very low.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:50.800]   Part of it could be that they've been wracked with personal tragedy, disability, death,
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.360]   sicknesses.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.480]   But why is it that so many people are in such financial stress?
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.520]   Why is it that so many people are in such heavy debt burdens?
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.440]   Now the facts show that the debt burden in America is much lower than it was 10 years
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   ago.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.400]   That's the facts.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.880]   The economic challenges of the last five years have been great for people to realize that
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.520]   it helps to pay off debt.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.240]   People are more aware of it than any time in the past.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.000]   But yet still, why is it as high as it is?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.600]   There's so many, what's the term for it?
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:46.080]   Maybe, it's a word, kind of like dichotomy, where it just doesn't seem to be, it seems
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:53.360]   to be conflicting, where one fact on one side and one fact on the other side seem to say
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.820]   exactly the same.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:01.840]   The facts seem to be woefully different and you can't really reconcile them.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.120]   How happy are most Americans?
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.640]   To me that's a major question.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.600]   How happy are most Americans?
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   I think in reality, many Americans are pretty happy.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.880]   But yet, ask yourself, as I ask myself, are they as happy as they could be?
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.840]   You know, I went through in preparation for this show, I was trying to think through and
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.800]   try to browse the interwebs, coming up with statistics and things.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.940]   As far as, what percentage of people love their jobs and love their lives and are totally
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.640]   happy and totally fulfilled with what they're doing?
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.480]   Problem with statistics is you can make them say everything that you want them to say.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.640]   I literally found two studies, I found a Gallup poll that was recent, I've got it right here,
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.000]   reading the PDF from the Gallup organization, this one is 2013.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.640]   The state of the American workplace, employee engagement insights for US business leaders,
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:07.040]   this is 2013, no this is 2011, it looks like, it was their data.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:14.000]   It shows that 70% of American workers are not engaged or actively disengaged at their
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   work.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.360]   Now on the same hand, I was Googling around and I found a CNBC study that shows that 70%
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.000]   of Americans are satisfied with their work.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.560]   So who do you believe?
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.880]   The title of the article is Americans don't want to shove their jobs, survey says.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.000]   So what do you believe?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.760]   I've got no idea.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:47.720]   But these economic challenges are entirely 100% solvable, but yet we've got to change
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.640]   the way that they're solved and I'm going to go over some of my ideas and some of my
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.720]   strategies for that today.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.960]   What about the health?
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.200]   Health of Americans seems like in some ways it's better than it's ever been.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:08.080]   After all, look at the facts, people are living longer than they've ever lived.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.600]   That's a fact.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.240]   Lifespans are incredibly long and yet more people are suffering from ongoing chronic
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:26.960]   illnesses and more people die from preventable causes than anything else.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:34.720]   I was looking at some statistics on the CDC website.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:44.080]   25% of Americans on average, 25% of Americans die from heart disease.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:52.440]   So in 2008, CDC website, percentage of all death caused by heart disease in 2008 across
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.720]   all ethnicities, 25%.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:02.000]   My understanding, if you ask most physicians, my understanding is that heart disease would
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.760]   be almost entirely preventable.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.480]   Almost entirely preventable.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:14.600]   I'm sure that there are some aspects that are not, but it seems to me it's almost entirely
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:20.280]   preventable and yet 25% of Americans die due to heart disease.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.000]   Stress related illnesses are incredibly high.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.960]   So anyway, enough of the problems.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.800]   I'm so optimistic, but enough of the problems.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.200]   Let's talk about some of the solutions.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:37.760]   I believe that good sound financial planning can solve some of these problems.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.880]   That financial planning, I'm going to apply that more broadly than here's the percentage
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.640]   that you should put into a retirement account.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:54.760]   Our lives, our financial lives are stressed out needlessly and we bring it on ourselves.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   These are choices.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.480]   There are many influencing factors.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.960]   You always know you're getting dumb advice or you always know, in my opinion, you always
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.400]   know you're getting dumb advice or a dumb perspective when somebody says this is the
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   one cause.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   There's never one cause.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.000]   Why do you get cancer?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.280]   I don't know, but it's not just from this one cause.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.240]   The example I think that most people could relate to because you probably have spoken
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.320]   with people is smoking causes lung cancer.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.040]   Well, is that true?
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.480]   I don't think so.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.280]   Now, do many people smoke get lung cancer?
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:39.680]   Absolutely, but we all know that story of the 98 year old lady in the Tennessee mountains
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:46.200]   that smoked a pack a day and drank whiskey for breakfast and lived to 98 years old and
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.480]   died a happy death of old age and was totally healthy.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.560]   Can you say that smoking causes cancer?
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.160]   Yeah, but that's not the only factor.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.360]   You have to look at it a little bit deeper.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.460]   Here would be how I'd look a little bit deeper.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.080]   If somebody is highly stressed, overweight, lives in a toxic environment, lives under
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.480]   a state of perpetual stress where their body is frustrated and upset, is dramatically overweight,
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.640]   takes a lot of drugs for various conditions, and that person smokes cigarettes on a daily
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:23.920]   basis, I think, going out on a limb here, it's more likely that their bodies would not
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:32.040]   be able to fight off the cancer cells than the person, the proverbial old lady in Tennessee
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.560]   who wakes up in the morning, walks outside with a cup of coffee and a cigarette, looks
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:44.000]   at the mountain, totally stress-free, relaxed, surrounded by friends and family.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.200]   I'm painting a utopia, I understand.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.320]   But relaxed, surrounded by friends and family, has clean air to breathe, clean food to eat
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.720]   from her garden.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.160]   Her body is able to keep those cancer cells in check.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.200]   So it's never just one thing, never just one cause.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.800]   And so there's never just one solution.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.600]   There's so many things that are brought together.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:20.080]   In general, this is a generalization, but in general, my observation is that most Americans
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.200]   don't seem to be so incredibly satisfied with what they're doing.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.720]   And I believe that they should be.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.800]   Many people love their work, they love their jobs, but many people seem to exist in this
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   state of in-between.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.320]   Well, there's two extremes.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.760]   So many people love their work, love their jobs, are living their passion.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.520]   We hear a lot these days about living your passion, and I'm into that.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   Cool, I get it.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.960]   Why do you think I'm up at 5.20 right now when I could be asleep?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.320]   This is fun, I enjoy this.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.600]   I value it, I enjoy this time spent talking to you.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.280]   I want it to be valuable to you.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.960]   So that's an example of me kind of living my passion.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.600]   So many people do that, and those people are inspiring to us.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.920]   Those people are people that we hear them talk at a speech, and our lives are impacted
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.880]   because of them.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:21.720]   Many people exist in absolute desperation, completely fed up with their lives, completely
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.880]   fed up with their circumstances.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:29.640]   And those people, because they're desperate, because they're changing, they take action.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.520]   Some of them take negative action, they commit suicide.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.920]   There is an epidemic of teen suicide going on in this country right now.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.640]   This is a by-point, but it's a major social problem that's got to be improved.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.800]   But many people commit suicide.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   That's action.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.360]   It's action because they're so fed up, they can't take it anymore.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.200]   Some people take action and they change their job.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.760]   I quit, they move.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:00.200]   Some people get so fed up that they leave the country, they go on a trip, they do something,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.760]   they change something.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.400]   But it comes at the point of such extreme pain.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.680]   But many people exist right in this in-between state, where it's not so bad that I have to
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:17.000]   change, but it's not so good that I would keep doing it if I didn't have to.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.920]   How else do you explain the popularity of bucket lists and the sites and blogs and things
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.640]   that are associated with that?
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:32.280]   Now, usually, the sites and the blogs are written by people who are doing it, but what
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.880]   about all the people that are drawn to that without doing anything?
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.280]   So there's an epidemic of just general malaise.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   I think that financial planning is a tool that can get people there.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.920]   Now, here's my evidence.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:53.080]   I can't prove this with numbers, but when you talk about things like retirement with
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:59.760]   people, most people want to retire.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.920]   But I question that sometimes.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:09.520]   And I try to ask people and talk to them and say, "What would you do if you were retired?
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   What would you do?"
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:19.080]   And a lot of times, as people get closer to that magic date, they tend to make different
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.800]   choices.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:28.560]   "Well, why wait to make those choices until you retire?"
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.720]   I ask people sometimes, "What would you do if money were not an object?"
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:38.800]   And usually, we're conditioned to respond first in our society with some sort of consumption-based
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   answer.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.760]   "I'd buy this kind of car.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.000]   I'd do this expensive thing."
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.720]   That's fine.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:53.240]   But once you get past all that consumption, ultimately, there's usually an answer.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.280]   I should look it up, but I'm not going to because we don't need the statistic.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.320]   Such a high percentage of people say that they would love to write a book, yet they
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.760]   don't write one.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.720]   Such a high percentage of people say that they would love to produce art, yet they don't
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   produce it.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   How can we fix this?
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:31.800]   How can we produce the art and produce the...I guess just the...I don't know how to say it.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.840]   Produce the art.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:39.840]   Produce the things that bring more lasting fulfillment.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.320]   The dots connect in my mind.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.400]   I'm going to try to connect them for you.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.920]   There's so many aspects to it, but I'm going to try to connect some of them and tell you
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.320]   where my mind goes and how I would achieve it.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.960]   I don't know how to communicate this perfectly.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   This is rambly.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.280]   I know that.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.940]   But here are my thoughts.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:03.840]   First of all, we've got to see through the illusion of happy consumption.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.000]   I'm going to paint two pictures for you.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.560]   This is a straw man argument.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.560]   I recognize that.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.560]   It's never going to be this extreme.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.840]   But I'm going to paint two pictures for you and you tell me which one appeals to you.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:24.160]   And I'm going to...these are not mutually exclusive, but go with me for a moment.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:36.440]   See in your mind's eye a beautiful, expensive, perfectly designed beauty of architecture
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.440]   house that you live in.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.320]   The house is large.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.080]   It's in the finest neighborhood in your town.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.400]   It's well landscaped.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.160]   It's manicured.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.760]   You don't have to do that.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.360]   Somebody else does that for you.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.200]   The house has beautiful furnishings from all the bright brand names.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.320]   The house is well appointed in every way.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   It's comfortable.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.320]   It's beautiful.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.840]   And the driveway is parked.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:12.240]   The most ideal vehicle for your situation and status in life.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.440]   Your dream car is parked right in the driveway where you can see it every day and all your
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.880]   neighbors can see it.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   House is freshly painted.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.160]   The grass is green.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.600]   There's grass.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.200]   The flowers are beautiful.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   It's large.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.480]   You have plenty of room for family to stay with you.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.160]   You have plenty of room for friends to stay with you.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.280]   See that in your mind's eye.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:43.000]   Okay, now on the flip side, picture a different house.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.480]   This house is on the edge of town, whatever your town looks like.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.960]   Maybe that's a semi-rural neighborhood.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.840]   Maybe it's just a small, it's on the edge of town.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   House is small.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   It's a cottage.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.440]   I don't know, 500, 800, 1000 square feet.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.800]   Just got just enough bedrooms.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   Maybe one or two or three depending on how many you need for the number of people.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.640]   Has a simple living room, simple furnishings.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   It's simple.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   It's not dirty.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.320]   It's not run down.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.280]   It's not dangerous, but it's simple.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:29.200]   Now question, which house would you rather live in?
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.480]   And there's not a wrong, right or wrong answer here.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.240]   Just an interesting thought experiment.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.280]   Which house would you rather live in?
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.680]   Now you pick the answer to that and let's go on.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.240]   Now house A.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:49.080]   You get up in the morning feeling tired because you went to sleep late the night before because
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.280]   you had to stay up late working on a work project.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   Your work is something that is very challenging, that drains you.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.560]   You stayed up until midnight and you had to get up at about 6am to get into the office
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   early.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.860]   Now you know you're supposed to work out in the morning, but you don't quite have time.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:16.860]   So you grab a cup of coffee, several cups of coffee to keep you awake and you rush out
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.860]   the door.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.860]   You jump in the car.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.400]   You don't have time to see your family in the morning, but right as you're leaving,
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.280]   your spouse or your children, if you have them, mention something to you that is just
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   even more stressful.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:35.160]   They mention to you about a financial expense that's coming up or a problem at school or
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   something.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.020]   So you rush out the door to a job and you're there at the job and you're stressed out.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.380]   You didn't have time for an enjoyable breakfast.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:47.500]   You're stressed out and you rush to the job and as you're at the job, things come all
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   day long.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.140]   This problem, that problem, the third problem, the fourth problem.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.300]   You're working with people you don't like.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.100]   You hit traffic on the way to work.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.420]   You sat in traffic for maybe 30 minutes, maybe an hour.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.420]   You got to the office.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.420]   You worked all day.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.660]   You escaped for a few moments at lunch to regain your sanity.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.260]   Scarf down some food.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.260]   You get home late at night, 7.30, 8 o'clock.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.100]   There's no dinner there.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.900]   So you had to pick up something on the way.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.940]   You sit down.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.540]   You have just a few minutes with your family.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.200]   Your spouse is upset with you.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.600]   Your kids are upset with you.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   You don't see each other.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.340]   You don't speak to each other.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:30.700]   And you drown your sorrows in a, I don't know, a glass of alcohol.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.300]   Now that's option A with a nice house.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.180]   But you got the nice house.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:40.860]   Option B. You wake up in the morning without an alarm clock.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.860]   Sun comes up.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.140]   Your body naturally wakes up.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.140]   You feel good.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.260]   You had a good night's sleep.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.300]   You get up.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.180]   You get breakfast if you're into that.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.600]   You have a cup of coffee.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.300]   You walk outside, look at the flowers sitting.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:33:00.020]   If you're a coffee drinker or a tea or whatever your morning routine is, you look at the flowers
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.940]   and you just admire the beauty of the day.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.380]   Spend an hour over breakfast with your family like you would on a Saturday.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.820]   Maybe eat blueberry pancakes.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.380]   That's your family tradition.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.060]   You spend that hour together.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.500]   Then you go and you sit down at your work.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.660]   Your work is meaningful to you.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.140]   You don't need to drive anywhere.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.580]   Your work is right there.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.340]   There's no need to go anywhere.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.460]   There's no need to face traffic or commute.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.420]   You get to work on work that matters to you.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.860]   You get to be close to your family and those that you love.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.860]   You have time throughout the day to take the call from an old friend.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.140]   You have time to walk outside and go for a walk at lunchtime.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.140]   You have time to eat healthy food.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.140]   Life is peaceful.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.940]   It's lower stress.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.620]   You have time to exercise.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.580]   You have time just to be a human being.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.580]   You finish the work that you need to do for the day and you work on some sort of artistic
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:08.500]   project and expression of your creativity.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.220]   In the evening, some close friends come over.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.820]   Maybe you visit with your neighbors.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.260]   You have a relaxing evening.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.420]   Maybe read a book, watch a movie.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.180]   Be with people that you love.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.900]   Play a game with your kids.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.580]   You go to bed at a healthy time.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.820]   Now I know I'm painting two pictures but here's the question.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.500]   Which of those days would you choose?
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.180]   I got to believe that whether or not I did a good job describing it, many people would
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:43.100]   be drawn towards the second option.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.740]   I feel pretty confident about that because when I talk to people or when I read online
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:54.380]   of what people write about what they would like to do, it's usually going to sound more
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.660]   like the second option than the first.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.460]   So my question is, is it the big house?
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.660]   Is it the car that is really motivating or is it the lifestyle?
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.460]   Now big houses and cars are great.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.460]   That's awesome.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.460]   Good for you.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.300]   But that doesn't bring the happiness.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.860]   You got to get the happiness first.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:18.420]   Let the big houses and cars come with time.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.580]   Consumption doesn't make us happy.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.300]   Consumerism is not the answer.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.220]   Now the mansion is awesome if you want to live there and if it's easy for you to live
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.700]   there and you can live that kind of lifestyle.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:38.380]   I know people who live in mansions and their life is exactly what I laid out in the second
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.820]   day but they do it in the first type of environment.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.820]   That's awesome.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.780]   But don't stretch for the first type of environment and get the life that's associated with that.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.100]   There are options where we can do it differently.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.420]   So one of the things that my guiding principles, consumerism is not the answer.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.420]   Production is the answer.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:02.380]   A lot of times what people view as pain is not actually pain.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.980]   Consumption doesn't ultimately bring us happiness.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.860]   Having extra unused rooms that we heat and cool every day by working at a job that we
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.700]   don't like is not what brings happiness.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.740]   Having rooms that are comfortable for us to live in, that are spacious enough for us
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:27.220]   to be in and doing work that we enjoy will kick us farther down that road.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.620]   Now I have a personal bias towards minimalism.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.700]   Not because of any specific amount of stuff that's right or wrong but here's my example
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.700]   that makes sense to me.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:44.380]   Do you enjoy going on vacation, walking into a nice hotel room, looking around at the furniture,
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.900]   looking around at the bed and just simply existing?
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.540]   Which of these two things gives you a greater sense of peace?
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:58.260]   Picture yourself walking into a well-appointed hotel room.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.780]   Not opulent, not expensive, just well-appointed.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:09.140]   It's a beautiful Saturday morning, you walk in with a small bag of your clothes.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.980]   You set that bag down in the corner and you turn to your family or the people that you
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:20.060]   love that you're with and you ask, "What should we do today?"
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:28.380]   Or scenario B is you walk into your garage.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.620]   Need I go further?
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:37.380]   Now for those whose garage looks like it could be on the cover of a book about garages, you're
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.740]   already doing it so why listen to me?
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.660]   But for many people, the garage would probably be a source of stress.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.460]   You got all your stuff in the garage in the hotel room, you don't have your stuff.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.220]   So because you don't have so much stuff in the hotel room, you can be.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:56.100]   You can go, you can explore, you can go to eat, you can be with your family.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.820]   So does the stuff make us happy?
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.420]   I would say it doesn't but that's my opinion.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:05.700]   I would say that the right stuff helps life to be a little bit better.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.380]   Living with 32 things that you own may be great for some people, for some people it's
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:17.260]   not but I would say less clutter and minimalism is a big factor.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:23.620]   I think doing work that you love and are passionate about is a big factor.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:28.020]   I try, I look and I look and I look and I never see people that just simply quit life
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.380]   that are really happy.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.580]   If you wanted to quit life and that's what makes you happy, you can do it today.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.660]   There's homeless bums in every city in the country.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.660]   They don't work.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.660]   Are they happy?
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.540]   Some of them probably are.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.100]   Many of them probably aren't.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:55.340]   But I see a lot of people who could quit that don't.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.180]   They continue working at things that they're interested in, that they enjoy, that they're
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:05.900]   passionate about and they continue working at these things long after they have to.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.980]   So why not understand that early on?
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:16.700]   I'm going to try to sell you in this show on the concept of getting out of debt.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.900]   Not that it's not something that you don't, many people don't intellectually grasp but
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:28.900]   that it's such a greater lifestyle and there's almost nothing worth borrowing for.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.820]   Especially nothing consumption related that's worth borrowing for.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.060]   Picture this, picture the difference.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.780]   Think first about your situation.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:50.220]   If you had no debt, no payments to anybody for anything including no monthly bills, no
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:55.660]   monthly utility bills, no monthly bills which most people aren't going to believe is possible
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.100]   and it's probably not possible but I'll come back to that in a second.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:05.860]   Say you have no debt and no bills.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:12.660]   How much stress would you have every month?
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.260]   How much stress?
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:22.100]   Now also pretend that you have no debt but you just have some ongoing bills.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.300]   How much money would you have every month?
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.560]   Quite a bit, right?
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.900]   To me that's the reason to get out of debt.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.940]   There's nothing that's worth bringing that stress into your life.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.900]   Now I have a mortgage.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:44.700]   I'm not walking away from the financial realities of life but conceptually that's got to be
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.380]   motivating.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:55.020]   To me it's very motivating.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:02.820]   I hope to sell you on the concept and why that's something that's worth striving for.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:11.060]   I hope to sell it to you as something that is desirable rather than something that is
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.140]   self-sacrifice.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:19.900]   If you view getting out of debt as pain, having to curtail your spending and being unhappy,
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.540]   you won't do it.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.760]   But if you view it as something that's worth achieving because it ultimately brings you
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:32.540]   greater peace and satisfaction and happiness, you'll work towards it.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.540]   It's not a sacrifice.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.540]   It's a pleasure.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.100]   I think there's great value in having lower expenses.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.340]   Let me paint again these two concepts for you.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.980]   Forget about the numbers.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.780]   Pretend that you have three scenarios.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:42:04.060]   Scenario A or scenario 1 is you earn X dollars and you spend 105% of that number.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.980]   Just 5% more than you bring in.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:17.180]   Scenario B is you earn X dollars and you spend 100% of that number.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:29.500]   Scenario C is you earn X dollars and you spend 50% of that number.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.260]   Which of those budgets would feel more comfortable?
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:40.820]   Most people are at maybe spending somewhere between 90 and 110% of their money.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.020]   It's hard to spend 110% on an ongoing basis but it's easy to spend 100% on an ongoing
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.540]   basis.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.580]   Many people save.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.660]   Most people save.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.860]   I reject a lot of the statistics that show that nobody saves money.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.860]   That's not true.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.860]   Lots of people save money.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.020]   It depends on how it's calculated.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.660]   Most people save something.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.940]   What if you had 50% expenses?
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:10.340]   So I believe it's possible and it's possible without sacrificing much lifestyle.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:17.980]   Now we've got to apply some different technology and some different ideas to the question.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.460]   And this show is about exploring ideas.
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:27.420]   There's so many great ideas and so many great technologies that are available to us.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:32.980]   If we were designing lives, if we were designing financial lives, would we design them the
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.460]   way that they happen or would we design them differently?
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.620]   I think we'd design them differently.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:44.700]   And there are technologies available today that have never been available before.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.900]   And we can access those technologies and we can profile them and we can see them from
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.620]   all over the world.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:55.540]   Take all of your expenses and there's technologies for eliminating them or for improving them.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:44:00.980]   I'm personally passionate about making housing a smarter choice.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:07.460]   So I love, you know, we can have a standard looking American house or we can have a standard
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.380]   looking American house that works well for us.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.740]   Why do our houses suck money out of our budgets?
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:17.820]   Why don't our houses keep money in our lives?
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.820]   So why don't we improve the efficiency of our houses?
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:27.660]   Not because of some environmental guilt trip but because it's simply better.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:33.100]   Why are our houses not more efficiently run, more efficiently made, more efficiently designed?
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.100]   Why do they cost so much to build?
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:48.780]   The technology exists for us to build and create houses that are, provide for us.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.380]   There's so many non-traditional options for housing.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.660]   There's the tiny house movement.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.660]   There are people who live in RVs.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.420]   There are people who don't own houses because they travel whole time.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.980]   There are houses that you build with your hands out in the woods.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.780]   There are houses that you build with your hands in the city.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.540]   There's so many options for housing.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:12.860]   Why is it that I have to have a 30 year mortgage for a house?
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.300]   Why is it that we have to pay for all of our food a la carte?
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.380]   Why don't our houses make food for us?
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:24.260]   Why are all the medians in our highways and our towns planted with non-productive trees?
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.500]   Why not replace some of those with fruit trees?
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.220]   Why do we pay for things like apples?
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.920]   Why do you buy apples if you're in a place where you can grow apples?
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.340]   Apple trees are easy to plant.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.020]   Just plant them out on the street and go out and pick some.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.180]   I live in the south here.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:44.380]   We don't grow apples, but why do people buy avocados and mangoes?
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:51.220]   Why aren't the roadsides decorated with avocado trees and mango trees and orange trees and
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:56.060]   everything that's freely available for all to come and get it?
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.300]   The reason why is because people may or may not pick it up and the maintenance people
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:07.220]   don't want to deal with the "trash" of the fruit under the tree.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.740]   Seems a little silly, but that's the reason.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.540]   Why can't it be better?
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:24.540]   Why can't ... I guess I'm going off on a tangent here, but I probably should do a whole show
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.540]   about this.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:32.100]   Technology exists today to provide for all of our needs cheaper and better.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:40.380]   There's zero reason for all of our budgets to be consumed with buying food and energy
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.500]   and water and transportation and all these things.
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.700]   All of these things have solutions, and we're going to profile those solutions.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:53.340]   There's zero reason why our houses have to be such a money pit, why we have to use these
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.580]   expensive technologies when there's simpler solutions.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:04.740]   You can heat water with an electric hot water heater, with a gas hot water heater, and with
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.500]   the sun.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.980]   Why do all of our homes not have a solar hot water heater on the roof?
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:15.220]   Again, I'm not coming at it from the perspective of to save the Amazon rainforest.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.380]   I'm coming at it from the perspective of dollars and cents.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:22.420]   One of my projects is I'd like to build a solar hot water heater in my home.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.540]   I haven't done it yet, but I've seen the technology.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.700]   It's so doable.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.700]   Why do we not use the energy that's raining on the house all day long to heat our water?
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.180]   Why do we pay for it?
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.500]   For that reason, why do we pay for water?
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.660]   Water falls freely in most parts of the United States.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.540]   Why do we not capture that water and use it?
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.100]   Why do many people pay $100 a month for their water?
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.620]   I was talking with a friend of mine.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   I asked him.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.220]   I don't have a water bill per se.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:56.180]   I live on a property with a well, so I have an electricity bill for the well.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:00.580]   I was talking with a friend who's on the municipal water supply.
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.900]   His water bill is about $100 a month.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.340]   I said, "Why on earth do you pay that?
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.340]   I live in Florida.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:10.340]   We have more rainfall than ... We have a lot of rain."
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:15.900]   If you step back, it seems crazy that anybody in Florida would ever pay for water.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.660]   Why don't we have a home that captures the rain, stores it for us to use?
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.860]   Well, you say, "We'd have to have a way to do that."
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.420]   Yes.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.420]   Why don't we?
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.420]   Some people do.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.540]   I think we all could.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:37.380]   Why do we have ... Go on and on.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:43.180]   I don't mean to, but why do we have houses that have to heat, have to cool?
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.180]   It's possible.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.180]   The technology is out there.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.980]   If you live in a place where it gets cold in the winter, I have seen ... There is technology
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:50.980]   out there.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:59.140]   I hope to profile it, but the technology exists where you never have to use any kind of outside
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:04.140]   heat other than the solar heat that falls, even in the middle of winter, in some of the
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.300]   coldest places.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:10.580]   I've never lived up in the Arctic tundra, so maybe you'd have to have some supplemental
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.580]   heat there.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:18.020]   I've certainly seen houses in snow country that you never have to heat, 100% on solar
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.020]   heat.
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:24.700]   Why aren't all houses designed like that?
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.900]   There are houses that are designed to be very, very cool.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:31.660]   This to me seems more challenging, but the technology exists.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:35.620]   What if we actually applied our heads to it and provided it and said, "We're not going
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.380]   to go with the ... I live in Florida.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.660]   $125 a month AC bills."
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.620]   Why doesn't the house cool itself?
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.860]   If we put our head on that and we put our brains around that, our houses should be able
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:51.700]   to do that, whether it's geothermal, whether it's natural air drafts.
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.940]   I don't know what it is, but there are options.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.540]   We're going to explore some of those options.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.260]   Why don't our houses make energy for us?
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:03.060]   Instead of having to pay the electric bill, why don't our houses just simply make energy?
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:09.060]   Whether that's solar panels on the roof or whether it's some other form of energy production.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.900]   I love the fact that I don't have any solar panels at the moment and they're very expensive
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:16.460]   as per cost of electric hour.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:17.460]   I get that.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.780]   I love the fact that prices are dropping.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:24.740]   I love the fact, my prediction at 10 years, it'll be standard.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.740]   Let's get going.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.740]   Let's make it happen.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:35.340]   Why do we have to pay anywhere from $200 to $1,000 a month for food that's not very good,
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.740]   that makes us sick?
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.420]   Why don't our houses create food for us?
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:44.900]   Why don't we have computer controlled growing systems in our houses that provide the optimal
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:51.940]   growing environment for the fruits and vegetables and plants that we need?
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:51:02.900]   There's so many solutions and I want this show to be about solutions.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.900]   Solutions exist.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.700]   I'm passionate about finding them for me and for my family and I'm passionate about profiling
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.380]   them for you and yours.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:17.980]   These things don't often seem like, it doesn't seem like a financial topic.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:23.280]   And yeah, I could talk through about how do you, and I will, but how do you create this
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.100]   from an investment plan, things like that.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.060]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:32.020]   What ultimately is the purpose of having a large investment portfolio that provides income
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.020]   for you?
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.580]   Is it not to pay for your daily living needs?
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:41.060]   To me that would seem to be the answer.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.100]   Investment portfolios purpose is to provide income for you.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:47.980]   Now there are a couple ways to achieve it.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:53.700]   You can build the portfolio that provides income or you can just simply provide the
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.620]   needs that you would spend the income on.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:03.340]   Now the right answer is probably a combination of the two.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:07.580]   We got to talk always about the combination of the two.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:12.860]   You can either buy a house that gives you a place to live or you can build an investment
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:20.060]   portfolio that pays you income over time.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.060]   Either one is okay.
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.460]   They both do the same thing.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:27.500]   You either have to pay rent or you own a place to live.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.500]   So there are multiple ways of solving this.
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.580]   There's lots of options that we can do and we're going to talk about those.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.900]   But just realize there's always a couple of choices.
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:40.900]   Now the right answer is again a combination of the two.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:46.660]   I don't think most people would ever really want to have where 100% of their needs are
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.660]   provided.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.380]   You can build a completely self-sufficient little piece of property somewhere and never
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:55.780]   go anywhere and never do anything beyond that but your property provides you with heat and
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.820]   cooling and food and water and that's great.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.980]   But it sounds a little boring to me.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   I'd want to go some places.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.820]   But on the same hand, if you don't have to come up with X thousands of dollars per month
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:10.780]   to provide for those living expenses, you have more money to pursue to do the other
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:14.300]   things that you can't provide for yourself.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.980]   So a little bit rambly but I'm going to wrap up.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.700]   That's kind of the concept that I want to explore.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:32.620]   I want to explore the concept of just building systems, systems that work, systems of support,
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.420]   systems that provide for our needs.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.020]   I want to talk through building those things in a flexible way.
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.020]   So many cool options.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.140]   I've got tons of ideas of ways to do things.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.700]   I'll try to sell you on my ideas and I want to hear your ideas back.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:51.140]   We'll try to find the people that are doing radical, interesting things and figure out
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.060]   how we can apply what they're doing to our situation.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.300]   I think that's it for today.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:03.980]   I'd love to hear some feedback from you.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.700]   Leave a note in the show notes.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.740]   Again, this is episode 8 of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:12.060]   Shoot me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:17.900]   I'd love to hear from you exactly what you're interested in.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:22.780]   I'd love to profile all of the interesting technology you can find.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.740]   I'll be clear.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:29.500]   I can't say to you that I'm out ahead forging the path and having it all done.
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.020]   I guess I am out ahead forging the path.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:37.580]   I don't have all this stuff done but I'm fascinated by it and I really feel that this is, even
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:43.100]   though I've struggled to communicate it this morning, I really feel that this is an underlying
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.740]   theme.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:55.620]   I really feel like using the techniques that we have, such cheap technology, such cheap
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:55:05.580]   options for how to live, combined with good understanding of investments and financial
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:12.580]   planning and taxes and the different vehicles that are available to us, combined with never
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:19.420]   before better opportunities to improve our income and make and earn high dollar amounts,
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:24.100]   combined with opportunities to provide systems that provide for our needs.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:31.940]   There's such amazing options available and we can craft lives that are free of the stress
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:38.260]   of providing for those daily needs and that are where we just simply enjoy living the
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:44.340]   way that we're meant to live.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.340]   Come on by the blog.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.340]   Leave show notes.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:47.820]   Leave a comment in the show notes.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.820]   Shoot me an email.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:50.820]   Hope this is helpful.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.700]   Look forward to another conversation tomorrow.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.980]   Again, with that, Joshua Sheets.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.980]   This has been episode eight of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.500]   Have a great day.
