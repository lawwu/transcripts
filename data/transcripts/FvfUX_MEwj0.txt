[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   The Christian life is not intended to operate on a minimalist ethic, on prohibitions.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400]   Don't touch that, don't do this, avoid that.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.880]   Success in the Christian life is not merely a matter of avoiding sin, and yet often we
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.120]   make it into a life of exclusions.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.880]   This is a point John Piper makes in his 1997 sermon titled "Running with the Witnesses,"
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.120]   a sermon on Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 on laying aside every weight.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.140]   Everything else in this text explains running or motivates running.
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.840]   So the point is don't stroll, don't meander, and don't wander about aimlessly.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.400]   Run as in a race with a finish line where everything hangs on the race.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.920]   Now what supports it?
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.160]   In verse 1 there are a couple of things said here as a means to running.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:13.480]   It says, "Lay aside every encumbrance and sin which so easily entangles us."
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:22.560]   Now I remember as a boy the effect a sermon had on me on this verse.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.280]   The only thing I remember was the distinction that the preacher made between, he was preaching
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:40.440]   from the King James at the time, weights, translated encumbrances here, and sins.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.840]   And he looked out on us and he said, "Not just sins, don't just lay aside sins to run
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.720]   this race, lay aside every other weight that gets in your way."
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.680]   As a boy, you know what the effect, it was a revolutionary effect that that had on me.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.720]   Because what it said to me was, and I speak it now especially for young people, kids if
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.200]   you can get this, but especially young teenagers and teenagers, but it applies to everybody.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:27.600]   What this says is, don't just ask, "What's wrong with it?" in life.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.480]   Don't just say about your music, about your movies, about your parties, about your habits,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.440]   about your computer games.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.320]   Don't just say, "Well what's wrong with it?"
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.080]   Don't just ask, "Is it a sin?"
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.240]   That's about the lowest question you can ask in life.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.840]   I'm going to do it if it's not a sin.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.680]   So tell me, is it a sin to do this?
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.440]   Well, not exactly.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.600]   Okay, that's all I want to know.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.920]   I'm going to have to do it.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.760]   And the preacher said, and I'm the preacher now, saying, this text says, "Look to Jesus
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.280]   and lay aside sins for sure and lots of other stuff too."
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.400]   Now that's a different way to live.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.960]   So what, well, preacher, what question as a 13 year old, 14 year old, should I ask if
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.360]   it's not, "Is it a sin?"
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.680]   And the answer is, "Does it help me run?"
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.280]   That's the answer.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   Does it get in my way when I'm trying to become more patient, more kind, more gentle, more
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.320]   loving, more holy, more pure, more self-controlled?
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.240]   Does it get in my way or does it help me run?
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.960]   That's the question to ask.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.080]   Ask the maximal righteousness question, not the minimal righteousness question.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.240]   That was the difference it made in my life.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.080]   And I've been ever since then, I didn't always live up to this.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.440]   I'm not making any claim that from age 12 on I did some great spiritual thing, but,
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.520]   oh, I had a trajectory that was so much better than the minimalist ethic that comes with,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.160]   "Well, what's wrong with it?
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160]   What's wrong with it?"
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.640]   "Well, I don't even want to talk about what's wrong with it.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.120]   Let's talk about, does it help me run?"
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.840]   Now, you know why that question isn't very often asked?
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.640]   Because we're not passionate runners.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.760]   We don't want to run.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.200]   We don't get up in the morning saying, "What's the course today?
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.680]   What's the course of purity?
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.120]   What's the course of holiness?
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.720]   What's the course of humility?
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.120]   What's the course of justice?
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.760]   What's the course of righteousness?
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.960]   What's the course of love?
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.920]   What's the course of self-control?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.840]   What's the course of courage and witness?
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.880]   Oh, God, I want to maximize my running today."
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.240]   If you have that mentality about your life, then you'll ask, not, "How many sins can I
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:18.880]   avoid, but how many weights can I lay down so that I am fleet-footed in the race of righteousness?"
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.880]   So good.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.720]   That was from John Piper's sermon on August 17th, 1997, titled "Running with the Witnesses."
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.880]   It's one of many of his sermons we host in their entirety at DesiringGod.org.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.320]   This sermon clip was sent in by podcast listener Alexander from the Ukraine.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.220]   Thank you, Alexander, for this.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.280]   We need your sermon clips.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.640]   If you have a favorite section from a John Piper sermon, send us the name of the sermon
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.960]   and the timestamps of when and where the clip appears in the audio, and we'll share it on
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   this podcast.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.080]   And of course, we'll give you credit for it.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.000]   Send us the details in an email to askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org, and put the word "clip" in the subject line.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.040]   Well, we often struggle to read our Bibles, and the struggle is often with doubt and cynicism.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.080]   It's a spiritual battle we face whenever we open our Bibles.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.520]   And tomorrow, John Piper will explain this dynamic and what we can do to confront it.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.840]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
