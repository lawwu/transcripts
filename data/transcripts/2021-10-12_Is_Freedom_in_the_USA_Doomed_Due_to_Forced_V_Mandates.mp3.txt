[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.540]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.700]   Today on the show, I want to share with you,
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.140]   talk a little bit about freedom in a time of coronavirus.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.580]   And I want to share with you, number one,
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.740]   why I think the United States is a pretty good place
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.740]   to be right now when judged from a global perspective.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.220]   Number two, what I think will happen in the coming months
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.960]   and next year or two with the pandemic.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.120]   And number three, how to prepare
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.460]   if things actually turn worse
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.900]   and the United States turns into a worse place to be.
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.760]   Much of my audience is based in the United States
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.940]   and I have spoken with many of my audience members
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.440]   who are quite concerned right now,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.700]   concerned about decreasing freedoms
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.180]   in their life and lifestyle.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.420]   Many are concerned about financial pressures,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.420]   new legislation brought requiring forced vaccination,
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.760]   requiring employers to force their employees
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.560]   to be vaccinated, and many of the fines
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.720]   and financial pressures that come,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.040]   many people are losing their jobs right now, et cetera.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.240]   And so there are a lot of people concerned.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.200]   So I just want to give you my perspective on these topics
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.040]   and tell you why I think the United States
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.440]   is a really good place to be right now,
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.140]   what I think will happen and how to prepare right now
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.840]   in case things get far worse.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.620]   Because I am very concerned that things
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.720]   might actually get far worse than what they are right now.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.820]   And I want to tell you what I think can and should be done.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.660]   To begin with, why do I think the USA
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.800]   is a pretty good place to be?
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.960]   I have made the intentional choice for the moment
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.300]   to move my family back to the United States.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.740]   And one big reason why I chose that,
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.160]   not the only reason,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.200]   but one big reason why I chose to do that is,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.600]   put simply, I'm done with the pandemic.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.640]   I'm done with the pandemic.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.440]   I don't understand why more people aren't done with it,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.680]   but I'm done with it.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.220]   And I don't desire to live as if it's 2020 anymore.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.520]   I desire to live a lifestyle of freedom.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.580]   Now, my experience is probably different
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.260]   than a lot of people's experiences around the world.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.660]   I have been, since the pandemic started,
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.620]   I think I counted on the other day,
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.800]   I think I've been in 10 countries,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.200]   10 different countries,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.640]   some for shorter periods of time,
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.740]   some for extended periods of time since the pandemic started
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.240]   and while I have made regular visits during that time
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.340]   to the United States,
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.440]   I have not been living in the United States
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.740]   for any of the pandemic.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.140]   And so that's given me a different perspective on things
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.840]   than many other people.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.740]   I've never been, throughout the pandemic,
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.020]   I haven't been a bunch,
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.160]   really an extremist on the different positions.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.860]   I was concerned very early as I watched things develop,
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.660]   very concerned, my concern is lessened,
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.900]   but I've never, I haven't gotten on a bandwagon
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   of this is what I, this is the side that I'm on.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.700]   I've been fairly moderate, at least by my own assessment,
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.940]   I've been fairly moderate in my perspectives,
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.340]   kind of trying to balance in the best way
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.200]   that I could come up with a prudent balance
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.620]   of risks and rewards and trying to make my way through.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.620]   Now, that has changed a lot over time,
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.680]   but I've tried that.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   But still, I reached the point over the past few months
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.020]   where I just said, I'm done.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.660]   I don't wanna deal with it anymore.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.300]   I don't understand why people are still living
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.820]   like it's 2020 when clearly it's not.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.220]   And in my experience, and again,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.540]   I think 10 different countries,
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.180]   nine or 10 different countries throughout the pandemic,
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.820]   I have observed that by far the place
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.060]   with the fewest restrictions, the most freedom,
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.000]   both legally speaking and culturally speaking,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.880]   of all of the countries that I have been in
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.300]   has been the United States, most importantly, Florida.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.040]   Now, there've been times throughout this pandemic
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.760]   that it has been quite shocking to me to experience that.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.140]   You get used to, for example, in the United States,
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.940]   there is a major arguments that people have
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.640]   about whether or not they should wear masks.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.320]   And there's an important argument to be had there,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.400]   but the US, meaning medically speaking,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.040]   does a mask do any good, blah, blah, blah,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.620]   it's an important conversation.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.880]   But in the United States,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.880]   the culture has been arguing over this subject
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.600]   for many, many months.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.000]   I'm not aware of anywhere else
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.200]   where there's been a clear argument about this.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.500]   Maybe it exists, obviously the world's a big place.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.320]   In many places, some places that I have been,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.760]   some people don't wear masks,
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.280]   but usually they don't wear masks
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.840]   just 'cause they don't care.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.000]   It hasn't been a real argument big time
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.920]   in the culture about whether we should wear masks or not.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.160]   The only place I know where the culture
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.560]   has been clearly divided has been in the United States.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.320]   And most of the places that I have been
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.960]   have been super into the wearing masks,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.160]   the big deal, et cetera.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.720]   So I became accustomed, right?
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.840]   I was accustomed to it and it became normal.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.000]   And I remember coming to Florida kind of back in late 2020
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.580]   and kind of, it felt weird to be close to people
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.580]   at the grocery store.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.600]   It felt weird to see people without a mask on.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.160]   It was just strange because I had been so affected
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.800]   by living in the cultures where it's normal
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.640]   and it's just what you do.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.440]   There's no question about it, it's what you do.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.460]   And that was where I started to see so clearly
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.260]   the distinctions between the United States
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.480]   and some of the other countries.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.300]   As I have traveled, I've studied the situation.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.200]   I've been able to live in many different countries.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.320]   I've been able to be fine.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   Like it's not been that bad.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.800]   I certainly have not gone to Australia or New Zealand.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.840]   No interest in going to those.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.680]   I've not gone to China.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.080]   No interest in going to China right now.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.080]   But it hasn't been that bad, all things considered.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.840]   But it did finally get to me over the summer.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.280]   It did finally get to me.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.480]   Every country that I have been in has had just,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   you face these dunder-headed regulations,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.880]   these things that just don't make any sense on their face,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.960]   but they are ham-fisted, clumsy attempts
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.400]   by government authorities to try to do something
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.480]   and be seen as doing something,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.320]   even though that something makes no sense.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.920]   Give you a simple story.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.660]   We were in Portugal a few months ago.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.200]   Portugal was overall fine, right?
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.120]   Not a lot of restrictions.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.640]   Everyone was wearing masks, good social distancing, et cetera.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.440]   Some big events closed down.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.080]   But for the most part, when I was in Portugal
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.780]   in the summer, I didn't have many complaints.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.720]   But I still saw a number of different events.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.000]   For example, we wanted to take the children to a park.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.600]   When you have four small children,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.400]   you learn to appreciate the value of local parks
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.520]   and playgrounds more than you ever did,
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.600]   because they provide a really valuable opportunity
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.160]   for the children to let their energy out,
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.080]   to run, to play outside, to be crazy,
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.000]   to get just to move and get some sunshine, et cetera.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.040]   And it's extremely valuable to you as a parent
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.320]   to have good access to good, high-quality local parks.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.160]   So we were in Portugal, and there was this nice local park
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.360]   near where we were in Lisbon in front of a mall.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.120]   And at that time in Lisbon and Portugal,
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.840]   all of the malls were open.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.040]   You could go to the mall, the stores were open,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.960]   no problem going there, no major counting.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.200]   They weren't counting everybody at the door.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.520]   There wasn't major problems.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.720]   It was a relatively normal experience at the mall.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.240]   But just outside the entrance of the mall,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.480]   just around the corner, was this nice little kids' park
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.000]   that the mall had installed, with a nice playground,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.320]   play set, benches for parents, et cetera.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.340]   And so we took our children to play on the playground.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.720]   And then the security guard comes over and says,
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.880]   "No, you can't, 'cause the playground is closed."
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.960]   Well, why is the playground closed?
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.080]   'Cause the government says playgrounds are closed.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.680]   And so just imagine this, right?
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   Over here, about 10 meters away,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.920]   you have the entrance to the mall,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.600]   where my entire family can go into the mall.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.360]   We can go and be in an enclosed indoor space
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.040]   with lots of other people,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.680]   pushed up close to one another,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.460]   standing in line, doing all the stuff,
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.160]   inside in a place with poor ventilation.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.520]   And there's no limit on that.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.480]   We could take the children there
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.720]   and let them run around and be crazy inside.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.960]   But just outside the mall, 10 meters away,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.860]   is an outdoor park with full sunshine.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.560]   We're the only ones there,
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.360]   and we're not allowed to be there on the play equipment.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.600]   I find that inconceivable.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.120]   I find it inconceivable how any security guard
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.340]   wouldn't just think and say,
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.400]   "I'm not going to enforce this."
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.080]   And we've gotten kicked out of playgrounds in Mexico,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.880]   got kicked out of playgrounds in Costa Rica.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.600]   We got kicked off of a playground in Portugal.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.320]   I think that's the places I remember
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.360]   getting kicked off of a playground.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.760]   In addition to that, though,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.040]   what really finally broke me was going to France.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.160]   Because I remember back about a year and a half ago,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.440]   after the initial chaos in China,
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.900]   China very quickly rolled out a vaccine passport,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.580]   sorry, excuse me, a coronavirus testing passport,
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.960]   a tracing app that all the Chinese citizens
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.400]   had to have on their phone.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.800]   And in order for them to ride the train,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   they had to show that they had a green check mark.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.320]   And at the time, it wasn't vaccination,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.080]   it was collecting the location data.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080]   And I remember sitting watching those videos and saying,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.720]   "Man, I can't imagine living under
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.200]   where the communists require you to show your pass
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   to get on a train.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.220]   That's ridiculous.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.480]   That is insane totalitarian tyranny."
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.400]   So then we went to France.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.880]   And when we were in France over the summer,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.480]   we followed all the rules to get into the country,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.840]   had no problem, were granted access to the country.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.600]   But at that time, France had imposed a vaccine passport
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   where you had to register yourself with the government,
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.760]   download the government application,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.120]   and then you had to put your vaccination records
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.840]   into the application in order to show
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.800]   that you were vaccinated and then demonstrate your QR code
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.000]   to gain access to any kind of facility.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.800]   And at the time, it was extremely intense.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.000]   I believe that they may have lightened it up slightly,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.040]   but when I was there, no access to restaurants
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.800]   without the health pass, no access to stores,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.240]   the entire malls were closed down,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.360]   guards at every entrance,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.040]   you had to scan your pass to get into the mall,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.480]   no access to cultural events, no museums,
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.300]   no art galleries, no access to any cultural events.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.200]   Quite literally, I couldn't even buy a coffee
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   from a cafe on the street without showing a health pass.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.700]   And thankfully, they didn't shut us out of a grocery store,
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.280]   so I was able to buy groceries,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.680]   and we were able to go to the market
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   and buy some food at a market, so we were able to eat,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.560]   but pretty much nothing else.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.340]   And my wife did not wanna go to France.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.100]   She had no interest in living under that.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.440]   She's like, "We're not gonna do that."
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.120]   And I convinced her, I was like, "No, come on,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.520]   "let's go for a time, it's probably not gonna be so bad.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.460]   "I know they have this,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.740]   "and we're obviously not gonna participate in that,
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.800]   "but it's probably not so bad.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.740]   "After all, I had read news reports,
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.040]   "the French are protesting, right?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.000]   "There's people coming and bringing their lunch
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.240]   "and having picnics right outside the restaurants
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.880]   "that are enforcing the health passport."
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.680]   And so I thought, you know what, they'll probably be fine.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.000]   After all, we're gonna be out in the country,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   we're not going to Paris,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.240]   we're gonna be out in the country.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.160]   I think the French people will be free-thinking.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.560]   They're not gonna stand for that.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.600]   The French have a long history
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.640]   of kind of standing up against totalitarianism,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.080]   and they have a very proud history,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   they have a protest culture.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.440]   I thought it'd be great.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.640]   Well, while I was there,
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.160]   I would read from time to time news reports
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.240]   that, hey, there was a protest somewhere,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.120]   but I could see no personal evidence
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.080]   of any of the French people actually standing up against it.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.280]   I had one, one restaurant,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.760]   the entire time we were there for a month,
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.960]   one restaurant served us food
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.160]   without forcing us to give a health pass.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.720]   And man, you would not believe the tip
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.160]   that I left at that place.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.320]   So we, in a month in France,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.000]   we had one meal at a French restaurant.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.040]   Every other time, rejected, rejected, rejected, rejected,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.440]   go everywhere, rejected, because I didn't do that.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.040]   And I asked them, I was like, why are you guys doing this?
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.120]   And they just rolled over and did it.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.720]   And so being in France, I just, I thought, I'm done, right?
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.080]   I don't want to do this anymore.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.520]   I'm gonna go where things are more free,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.480]   because it's no way to live under that stuff.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.360]   And you say, well, Joshua,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.780]   just give them your vaccination records
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.720]   or go and get a negative COVID test, right?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.360]   'Cause every two days, the other thing is,
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.960]   if you're not vaccinated under the system at that time,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.240]   then you could every two days get a COVID test
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.400]   and you could get that registered on your QR code.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.320]   And I just find that utterly, like, no,
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   I am not going to put up with these totalitarian Nazis
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.200]   putting their applications on people's phones.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.520]   I'm not gonna support it.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.060]   I refuse to give money to anybody
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.800]   who supports something like that.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.040]   Like, that's just absolutely disgusting
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.000]   for anybody to participate in those kinds of schemes.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.440]   I'm not gonna, I can't look myself in the face
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.120]   or look my children in the face
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.960]   and say that I care at all about human freedom and liberty
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.000]   and then do that, right?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.640]   And you're there in France where, what is it?
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.120]   Liberté, égalité, fraternité, the French national motto.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.320]   Well, you've got the jackbooted thugs
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.840]   keeping you out of anything
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.160]   and you've got the government coming by
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.560]   and destroying the business owners saying,
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.160]   you have to enforce this.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.600]   It's insane to me.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.640]   And so it kind of, it was the straw
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.240]   that broke this camel's back.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.640]   I said, that's it, I'm done.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.160]   And my wife said, I told you so, right?
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.320]   I told you you weren't gonna like it.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.800]   And all right, well, I guess you're right, honey.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.640]   You were right.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.440]   I shouldn't have come here in the first place.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.560]   I should have skipped the whole place, et cetera.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.760]   But you see all across Europe,
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.520]   you see many countries have done the same thing.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   And I really wanted to go to France
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.120]   and I shouldn't have gone.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.960]   It was a mistake.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.640]   I should have just, I should have skipped the whole thing.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.600]   But along the way, I couldn't get into Asia,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.560]   which is where I wanted to get into.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.440]   At the time, I was trying to go to Singapore,
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.040]   Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, this winter, Malaysia.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.680]   I wanted to spend my time in those places
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.880]   and I couldn't, they were all closed.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.600]   And I just, I'm not gonna go and do a two week quarantine
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.520]   and sit with my children in a hotel room for two weeks.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.920]   And finally I said, that's it, this is not fun anymore.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.320]   I don't wanna travel, this is not fun.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.920]   So where should we go?
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.480]   And just being done with COVID,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.040]   the freest place that I know of in the world is Florida.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.160]   And I said, let's just go back to Florida for a time
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.480]   and just be done with this
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.800]   and wait for all this to blow over.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.560]   The final kind of hurdle to pass
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.280]   was taking the stupid COVID test
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.040]   to get back into the United States.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.760]   And what frustrates me about that
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.680]   is that they forced me to test my children
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.600]   to get back into the United States.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.620]   Many countries, for example, in Europe right now,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.640]   if you are over the age of 12,
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.320]   then you have to do a COVID test to enter many places.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.600]   In some places it's six,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.560]   just depends on the individual country,
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.240]   you can check their requirements.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   But to get in the United States
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.480]   is everyone over the age of two.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.960]   I don't mind doing a COVID test.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.640]   I don't understand why there aren't more easy tests
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.060]   available, but I've done lots of COVID tests for travel.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.000]   I've done a bunch of self tests just to make sure,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.640]   do a quick antigen test to make sure
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.000]   if you're gonna be in a place that,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.960]   hey, I might not be infected and not know it, et cetera.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.600]   So I've gotten pretty good at getting a Q-tip
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.200]   jabbed up my nose and jabbing a Q-tip up my own nose
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.680]   and do my own self test.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.320]   It's not been that big of a deal for me,
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.720]   but it's very different for my children.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.760]   And it's one thing when you impose
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.480]   some kind of hard medical procedure,
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.780]   painful thing on your children,
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.080]   because you know it's for their good.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.700]   But we're sitting in the Madrid airport
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.160]   doing our COVID test to get back into the United States.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.920]   And I have to hold my younger children down
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   where I got their head cemented against my head,
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.160]   my legs and my arms wrapped around them,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.560]   my legs wrapped around them, and I'm immobilizing them
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.680]   so a nurse can jab a Q-tip up their nose.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.320]   To do that to your two-year-old and your four-year-old,
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.640]   it's just, it's not worth it.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.720]   All of my children crying and done with it.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.280]   And I've put a lot on them.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   And I just said, I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.120]   There's no need for it.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.200]   I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.720]   We're not putting up with this.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.440]   And it was so nice to get back to the United States.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.760]   And let me tell you,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.600]   if you think it's bad in the United States,
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.640]   I'm here to tell you,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.440]   it's quite literally a breath of fresh air.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.420]   I walked out of the Miami airport,
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.240]   I took my mask off, I dumped it in a trash can,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.720]   and I haven't put one on since.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.220]   And after two years of wearing a mask everywhere,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.160]   that first week, I didn't realize
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   how acculturated I had been,
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   how conditioned I had been into this kind of new reality.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.240]   And just being able to walk around
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.800]   and breathe fresh air again and not worry about,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.640]   it took a few days for it to settle in.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.680]   First week I was back,
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.920]   I was back at a conference in Orlando
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.360]   and in a room with 3,000 other people,
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.060]   elbow to elbow, no social distancing.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.320]   Guy on my left, guy on my right,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.400]   guy in front of me, guy in back of me,
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.040]   bouncing up and down, singing, talking, et cetera.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.080]   10% of the people wearing masks, 90% not.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.360]   And people were done with it.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.800]   And it just was this tremendous sense of relief
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.820]   to be done with the pandemic
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.000]   and to be out of it again.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.040]   And it kind of affirmed to me,
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.920]   yeah, this is the right decision for now.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.780]   And so I share that with you to know
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.220]   that if you think things are bad in the United States,
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.840]   I understand that things are difficult in some places
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.000]   and we're gonna talk about regulations, restrictions now.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.080]   But I just wanted to share that kind of personal travelogue
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.520]   for you to know that if you think things are bad
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.480]   in the United States,
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.200]   they are much better than most places in the world.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.560]   You would not believe what many places in the world
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.940]   have gone through and have been living with.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.080]   That's not to say that everywhere in the world
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.600]   is a totalitarian, tyrannical place.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.040]   When I was in Western Europe,
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.560]   I was very quick keen to get out of Western Europe
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.420]   and get into Eastern Europe.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.260]   And all around the world,
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.220]   there are places and cultures where they've ignored it.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.760]   I was planning to go to Albania,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.640]   spend some time in Albania and all of my,
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.000]   I haven't been there,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.320]   but all of my research indicated,
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.760]   yeah, the Albanians just, they're not into the COVID thing.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.880]   No rules, no restrictions, no masks and all that stuff.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.440]   Like they're just, they're moving on with their life.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.640]   And all around the world, you see kind of similar things.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.880]   I follow a lot of travelers who travel in countries
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.240]   and you have all these Western travelers coming in
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.280]   and coming back and say, giving their reports.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.400]   And so I follow them with interest.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.080]   So it's not that the whole world has been under that,
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.720]   but in much of the world that Americans
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.240]   are more closely related to,
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.360]   just know that the United States
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.360]   has been a vastly better place through it.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.040]   By the way, I will cover, if you're screaming,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.320]   yeah, but 700,000 dead, Fairpoint.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.440]   If I remember it, I'll come back
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.320]   and cover that at the moment, a little bit later.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.480]   So let's talk about where we go from here
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.960]   and what I think will happen.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.240]   Let's go back to the beginning of the pandemic
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.000]   when I laid out what I saw as kind of the three off-ramps
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.400]   out of the pandemic.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.560]   When you have a global pandemic, what happens?
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.800]   How do you get out of it?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.780]   How do you overcome it and be done with it?
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.400]   And at the time, I believe I said
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.080]   that there were three off-ramps that I saw.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.800]   Off-ramp number one is that the virus
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.520]   turns out to just be not such a big deal.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.880]   Okay, off-ramp number two is you develop good therapeutics.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.240]   And then off-ramp number three
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.520]   is you have widespread immunization,
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.440]   either through the development of vaccines
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.080]   or through natural immunity through widespread infection.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.960]   So let's talk about number one.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.120]   Virus is no big deal.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   Now, this was one where at the beginning of the pandemic,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.080]   back in early 2020, it was unclear.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.240]   It was really unclear because all of the initial indications
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.240]   about the severity of SARS-CoV-2 were unclear.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   You had, on the one hand, you had this general sense that,
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.960]   "Hey, this is no big deal.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.840]   It's not a big deal."
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.760]   The Chinese government was saying,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   "Oh, it's no big deal, no problem."
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.280]   But then you had all kinds of wacky stuff.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   You had leaked videos of people tumbling over on the street,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.040]   like literally falling down while walking down the street.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   You had, and that didn't make much sense medically,
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.760]   but then simultaneously you had the Chinese government
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.120]   welding steel plates onto apartment buildings.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.800]   They came to apartment buildings
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.920]   and they welded steel plates over the doors
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.360]   to keep everybody locked in the apartment building
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.240]   so that they didn't spread an infection.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.600]   You had Chinese government building
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   these massive hospitals just overnight.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.520]   And you're thinking, "What is going on?"
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.640]   We knew for a long time, since 2003 with the SARS pandemic,
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.160]   we knew that the Chinese government lied
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.240]   right through their teeth back then.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.320]   And so the most probable answer
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.520]   was they were lying this time.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.400]   And yep, yep, they lied completely, concealed everything.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.080]   Just the whole thing, it's just been a nightmare
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.840]   to watch how insane the Chinese government has been.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.200]   And I mean, don't get me started.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.960]   Like you'll go and look at the World Health Organization
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.240]   so-called investigation.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.480]   It's just, stay on point.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.280]   The data was unclear.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.480]   And so then you started to get data.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.680]   And if you remember in those early days, nothing made sense.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.920]   Nothing made sense about what was actually being said
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.760]   and done.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.680]   So just take you back in your,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.240]   and you remember, I don't have the timeline of this,
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.480]   all this stuff, but remember that in the first,
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.720]   the whole concept of there being a deadly virus
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.800]   was supposedly a hoax.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   Remember you had the, in Washington, DC, a march,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.400]   and the person in charge of health of Chicago
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.680]   is saying, "No, go march."
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.880]   And you had Nancy Pelosi saying,
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.920]   "Go and stand up in New York and do your marches
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.240]   "and whatnot while the data's coming out."
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.480]   People were saying, "Minimize gatherings."
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.520]   Then all of a sudden, hey, there starts to be more stuff.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.160]   And then there was the mask debacle, right?
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.440]   Anthony Fauci in the United States comes out
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.360]   and he says to the American people,
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.720]   "You shouldn't wear a mask
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.880]   "because this is a virus that won't affect it.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.760]   "And so you should not wear a mask.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.440]   "Definitely not, it doesn't do anything for you.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.960]   "It just creates a false sense of security.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.560]   "There's no need to wear a mask."
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.200]   Meanwhile, the FBI is stealing masks
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.920]   from private entrepreneurs who had collected them
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.560]   and were selling them to medical professionals
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.800]   at inflated prices.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.600]   The FBI is sending cops in New York
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.960]   and stealing the thousands of masks
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.160]   that the guys had accumulated and stockpiled
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.680]   and they were selling in the private market
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.440]   to medical professionals who couldn't get enough PPE.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.920]   And so then all of a sudden, everything changed
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.000]   and you didn't know what to believe
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.600]   'cause you knew everyone was lying
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.960]   and you didn't have a clue what to do.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.760]   And so we all sat in our homes and waited to see.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.680]   And the data was difficult to discern
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.760]   for many people in the beginning.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.120]   Remember we had many of the early predictions
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.840]   that were hardcore predictions of millions
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.600]   and millions of people dying across the United States
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.680]   and there was really mixed results.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   And it took a while to emerge that COVID is largely a disease
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.440]   of highly variable outcomes depending on who was involved.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.400]   And so for people who are old
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.880]   or for people who have a lot of underlying conditions,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.000]   people who are fat, people who have poor metabolic health,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.720]   then COVID is a very serious disease.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.960]   For people who are not old, for people who are not fat,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.760]   people who are in good metabolic health,
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.320]   most of the time it's a very minor disease.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.440]   And so you had kind of these two narratives
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.680]   that took time to emerge from the data.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   But what has emerged is that in terms of the virus,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.560]   what actually the first off-ramp, the virus isn't as bad,
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.600]   for most people, the virus has turned out
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.640]   to be not so bad as feared.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.920]   For old people, for obese people,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.200]   for people who have underlying conditions,
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.640]   who are unhealthy, it is very severe.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.920]   And so that's one good off-ramp.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.880]   The second thing though, that's valuable to know
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.720]   about that off-ramp is, hey, can the virus weaken?
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.960]   That was the other expected thing.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.280]   Most viruses have a tendency to weaken.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.000]   And so then you had the variants
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.160]   and you had the emergence of the Delta variant,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.800]   which while not stronger, seems to be more contagious
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.320]   and certainly supplanted the previous iterations
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.960]   of the virus.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.640]   So off-ramp number one, I would say,
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.480]   is a story of two diseases
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.160]   based upon the person who is sickened.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.720]   Young people, healthy people, et cetera,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.560]   most of the time it's mild with a few moderate cases.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.440]   Old people, sick people, fat people,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.320]   much of the time it can be quite serious
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.880]   with a lot of complications.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.480]   So that one has not been an obvious off-ramp.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.800]   The second off-ramp though,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.920]   was the development of new therapeutic treatments.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.440]   The idea is, if you can develop good therapies
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.360]   that allow you to effectively treat a sickness,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   then you can open things up and kind of go about your life
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.360]   and not worry about much.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.640]   And so there, I think tremendous progress has been made
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.000]   all around the world with the development
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.760]   of good therapeutic treatments.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.000]   It's well understood now that simple things
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.240]   like vitamin D levels make a dramatic difference
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.720]   in your outcomes with coronavirus.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.200]   And so I can't imagine anybody
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.960]   not regularly taking vitamin D
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.560]   and making sure that vitamin D levels are high
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.040]   in their entire family to make sure
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.080]   that they minimize the impact of the virus.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.160]   You have the importance of vitamin D, of zinc.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.840]   There've been the development of a number of drugs, right?
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.320]   The much debated arguments about ivermectin
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.600]   has been quite interesting to watch,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.360]   but I still am persuaded that
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.080]   while not being a medical researcher,
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.480]   I still am persuaded there's pretty good evidence
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.400]   that that is effective, especially as a prophylactic.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.040]   Much argued about, still no conclusive data,
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.520]   but that's an interesting debate that people watch.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.920]   And then actual therapeutic treatments, right?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.840]   I guess what would be the biggest one?
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.880]   Monoclonal antibodies, some of the development
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.760]   of these new systems of treatment
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.360]   that have been having really good effects.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.200]   And especially if caught early enough
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.440]   and treated early enough,
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   then COVID is not a death sentence for many people.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.320]   And so there's a number of good things
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.920]   that all reasonable people I would imagine are doing
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.120]   to protect their health, getting healthy,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.000]   building up their metabolic health,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.720]   getting lots of sunshine, taking vitamin D supplements,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.280]   doing all the stuff that can result
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.880]   in having the experience of the virus
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.760]   be much less significant for most people.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.180]   And so I think we've made tremendous progress there.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.840]   And then even in the worst cases,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.880]   I'm not an emergency room physician or nurse,
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.360]   but it seems like even in the worst cases,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.600]   they have gotten better at treating
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.640]   even some of the worst cases of COVID.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.920]   So that's been a good off-ramp
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.680]   that is clearly visible and available.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.760]   Then the third off-ramp is immunity,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.780]   widespread immunization and immunity.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.780]   So here there are two obvious opportunities.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.200]   Number one is vaccination,
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.400]   and number two is natural immunity,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.760]   just people who are infected
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.420]   and is there natural immunity
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.880]   that is conferred because of that infection.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.280]   So in the beginning days of the virus,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.720]   it seemed very unlikely that vaccines
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.660]   could be developed quickly enough to do much good.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.480]   You were dealing with a viral infection,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.040]   which is famously difficult to develop a vaccine for.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.800]   We all heard the stories about how
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.040]   they never successfully developed a virus for AIDS,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.960]   never successfully developed a virus for SARS,
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.960]   I think it was, the difficulties with the flu virus,
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.080]   things like that.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.560]   And so nobody really thought we'd be able to develop
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.260]   an effective vaccine quickly.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.600]   And then we did, right?
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.740]   In the United States,
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.360]   President Trump did Operation Warp Speed
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.280]   all around the world.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.240]   I think if memory is right,
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.100]   the Sputnik vaccine was the first to be trialed
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.940]   in humans out of Russia.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.080]   You had vaccines developed in South America,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.840]   in Asia, all around the world.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.000]   So where today there's so many vaccines
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.680]   that have all been developed and been trialed
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.000]   and with differing amounts of efficacy
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.800]   and different results all around the world.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.920]   And it's been remarkable to see that.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.440]   It's just absolutely incredible
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.160]   how quickly the vaccines have been able to be developed
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.240]   and rolled out and manufactured.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.720]   It's truly amazing.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.840]   It's an amazing story of the modern era.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.980]   I feel like for everything
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.600]   that you wanna criticize people about,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.980]   you kinda gotta see the opposite side
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.640]   and recognize that people are not stupid.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.880]   I've said this recently, for example,
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.380]   talking about the supply chain.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.060]   On the one hand, the modern supply chain
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.200]   is a very weak thing when subjected to stress.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.880]   To me, that seems very obvious, right?
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.480]   The just-in-time delivery system
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.540]   has resulted in not much slack in the supply chain.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.380]   On the other hand,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.160]   the modern supply chain is an absolute miracle.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.440]   When you look at how quickly it can adapt,
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.320]   it's actually really remarkable.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.760]   And so I feel like most things are like this,
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.020]   where honesty compels us to acknowledge
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.040]   that there's been massive progress
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.520]   while simultaneously there being frequently
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.840]   many challenges that are new and different.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.640]   So this vaccine rollout all around the world
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.640]   has been remarkable to see.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.920]   And while we don't have any long-term data
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.840]   on the safety of vaccines
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.520]   and we don't have any long-term data
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.040]   on the efficacy of vaccines,
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.360]   the short-term data seems really, really good, right?
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.160]   The short-term safety, very high,
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.680]   short-term efficacy of the vaccines,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.640]   at least in terms of measuring from protection
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.600]   from the most serious of cases
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.120]   seems to be really, really good.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.840]   And so that's exciting
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.120]   because especially for the most vulnerable people,
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.880]   the most vulnerable people can be vaccinated
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.600]   and can be hopefully protected
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.560]   against many of the worst case outcomes
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.640]   of the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.760]   And so that's just been an amazingly effective
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.960]   and productive thing.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.320]   And then if we match that with natural immunity,
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.960]   we haven't known, and a year ago we didn't know
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.080]   how strong the natural immunity was,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.200]   how long the antibodies would stay around.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.080]   Of course, we still don't know any long-term data,
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.320]   but it seems really good
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.920]   that people who have had the previous infection
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.480]   are very well protected against current
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.000]   and future infections.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.240]   And so that's just phenomenal news, right?
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   To know that the body retains its ability
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.400]   to protect against the virus.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.280]   It means that you could pretty much go about your life
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.600]   and not worry too much about it.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.200]   So where do we go from here, right?
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.520]   Those are the three off-ramps that I sketched out
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.960]   for you in a podcast a year or so ago.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.280]   And to me, those three off-ramps, we've made progress,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.040]   tremendous progress on all of them.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.720]   Anybody, virtually anybody,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.200]   anybody listening to me who wants a vaccine has had one.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   Anybody listening who wants good therapeutic treatments
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.720]   can have them.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:11.240]   And the disease itself has proven to be
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:16.200]   more of a nuisance for most healthy people
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.360]   rather than something really serious
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.680]   and really long-lasting.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.440]   And so the data on all fronts is really good.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.480]   Now, what is quote-unquote not good?
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.680]   Well, what's not good is the fact
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.040]   that there is simply no containing the virus.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.520]   The last holdout on this was obviously Australia
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.360]   and New Zealand, right?
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.200]   Australia was committed for two years to a zero COVID plan,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.520]   turning the entire former penal colony
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.520]   into a current day prison
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.400]   for all of the inhabitants and residents,
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.040]   not letting people in, not letting people out,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.000]   not letting people out of their houses.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.440]   And the goal was zero COVID, zero COVID.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.840]   Well, they finally abandoned the zero COVID policy
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.480]   a few months ago in reality,
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.880]   and then started making public statements
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.720]   a month or so ago,
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.440]   "Hey, we're officially abandoning zero COVID.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.240]   We're just gonna, we're gonna abandon zero COVID
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.000]   when we get everybody vaccinated."
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.880]   And, but what has become obvious
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   is that coronavirus is endemic.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.120]   It is not a pandemic, it is endemic.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.360]   It's something that is within the culture
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.920]   and will never go away.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.240]   It will change, it will mutate.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.560]   It'll just be there along with all of the other,
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.880]   the other sicknesses and diseases that afflict us,
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.160]   the other viruses and the respiratory things
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.000]   that we catch, et cetera.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.320]   And so you see many people openly discussing that,
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.880]   and you see many people accepting it.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.360]   Several European nations have led the way.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.440]   Is it Norway, Denmark, Sweden, I think were the three,
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.000]   but I could be mistaken in those specific countries,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.680]   but they have said,
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.080]   "We're removing all coronavirus restrictions.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.160]   There's no restrictions, there's no rules,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.800]   there's no mandates."
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.480]   It just is, it is what it is.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.440]   And we're gonna try to keep our hospital system
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.720]   strong enough to help people who are sick enough
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.200]   to need hospitalization,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   but we're not enforcing specific policies.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.920]   Singapore has said this several months ago,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.400]   they said they were moving in this direction.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.480]   I listened to a talk by the chief epidemiologist
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.080]   of Singapore and he explained
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.440]   how they were moving in this direction.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.520]   And that's even as of this last week or so,
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.280]   while they've imposed some short-term things,
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.360]   he said, "As quickly as we can build hospital capacity,
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.440]   that's where we're going."
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.160]   Is we're just, we're gonna eliminate
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.320]   all coronavirus-related restrictions
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.040]   and we're moving on with life.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.760]   And I think what you see very clearly
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.000]   is that the people broadly have decided that.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.880]   It's very obvious here in the United States,
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.920]   that it's been obvious for some time,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.200]   that the people have decided that they're done.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.240]   They're done with restrictions, they're done with it.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.320]   As at the conference last week,
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.040]   with 3,000 people, you got 3,000 people in a room
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.680]   who have all decided we're done.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.120]   And the vulnerable people,
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.160]   I'm sure there were many people
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.080]   who have various vulnerabilities
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.920]   and they chose to watch things virtually,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.800]   but there were 3,000 people in a room
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.740]   who've decided they're done.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.800]   You see the football stadiums all around the country,
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.600]   full of people.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.760]   Every event that I go to is full, right?
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.680]   People are done, they don't care, they're done.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.760]   Everyone who wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.840]   Lots of other people have had the infection
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.440]   and have natural immunity,
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.520]   and everyone's pretty much made their own risk assessment
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.080]   and decided that, hey, you know what, we're done.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.200]   And I think that's, I've seen it the strongest
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.460]   in the United States, but I think the same thing
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.240]   is happening in many other places.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   At least as best I can read the cultural signals,
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.260]   it seems like many people all around the world
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.320]   have made exactly the same decision to different areas.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.920]   Americans are much more brash about it,
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.560]   much more open about it, much more kind of stubborn
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.160]   and willing to fight, but all around the world,
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.960]   you see the same kind of thing.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   And I hope that it continues.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.080]   I hope that people continue, this last week,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.040]   there were major protests in Rome about vaccine mandates,
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.500]   several major protests all across Europe.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   You see the disarray in the flight system,
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.600]   which seems like there's a very good chance
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.360]   that right now, all the disarray with Southwest Airlines
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.920]   and their vaccine mandate in the United States,
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.920]   I think that there's a good chance that that will spread.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.640]   I don't expect to spread everywhere,
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.080]   but I think there's a good chance
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.800]   that that movement will continue to spread.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.600]   And so, as far as I can see,
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.340]   I don't see why anybody should be living
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:43.340]   at this point in time as though the vaccine's still on,
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.040]   or sorry, the pandemic is still on.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.640]   I don't see the point at this point in time.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.240]   Which brings us to now the concerns
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.800]   and the fears that many people have.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.840]   Right now, the thing that concerns most people
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.280]   is imposition of mandates.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.120]   There are many millions and millions of people
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.680]   all around the world who have decided
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.600]   that they don't want a coronavirus vaccine,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.280]   or at least they don't want any of the coronavirus vaccines
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.640]   that are currently available,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.000]   or at least they don't want a coronavirus vaccine right now.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.400]   And they have decided that they are making a different choice
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.640]   for whatever their personal reasons are.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.360]   And yet governments all around the world
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.760]   have decided to impose forced vaccination on people.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.660]   And this was big news in the United States.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.980]   Some weeks ago, President Biden announced
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.280]   that he was going to direct OSHA to rule out
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.580]   and that any employer with more than 100 employees
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.480]   was going to require all of its employees to be vaccinated.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.800]   Now, I'll tell you just my opinion on this.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.040]   I studied, so on the one hand,
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.520]   I think that in the United States,
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.560]   there is a good legal precedent
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.680]   where the federal government potentially
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.560]   could mandate vaccination for all people.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.960]   I think, what was it, Jacobson versus Massachusetts,
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.900]   if memory is right, back from the early 20th century,
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.960]   was I think a case that, to my non-lawyer brain,
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.520]   seems like it could be applied.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.000]   And you could say, look, the federal government
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.280]   has the legal ability based upon this case law
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.420]   to force and mandate vaccination.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.960]   But having the legal ability to do something
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.940]   and having the actual moral authority,
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.480]   having the actual mandate given to you by the people
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.800]   to do something is a very different thing.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.560]   And I think, at least in the United States,
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.840]   where I understand the culture, I believe,
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.720]   not a chance in the world that they would
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.320]   be able to effect that.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.920]   There would be harassment and killing widespread
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.440]   of any government agent who tried to enforce that
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.080]   across the board.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   Now, what I think is really interesting
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.440]   is if you study how the government
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.640]   is actually in the United States trying to force compliance
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   through the employers and through the fines,
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.200]   I think that's probably the best lever
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.400]   that they could push on to kind of accomplish that goal,
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.240]   to accomplish the goal of forcing everybody
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.480]   to be vaccinated.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.880]   But even that, I think that in the United States,
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.840]   I don't think it will go through eventually, right?
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.800]   You've seen OSHA do absolutely nothing on this
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.600]   in the month and a half since President Biden
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.160]   announced the policy.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.640]   Now, of course, OSHA says, oh, it takes us months
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.000]   and months to develop the regulations,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.480]   as it should, as it does.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.860]   But if and when they finally actually come out
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.200]   with some kind of regulation,
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.880]   then we'll see what it actually says
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.840]   and then see what people actually are willing to enforce.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.280]   I don't think that this forced vaccination scheme
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   in the United States will win, I don't.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.060]   First, I think that many of the mandates
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:59.040]   that are already issued are facing legal challenges
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.520]   that are very, very significant.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.480]   You look at the people who are suing various employers,
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.800]   suing the government,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.720]   I think that the legal challenges are quite high.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.320]   When you actually, and again, not a lawyer,
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.920]   but when I listen to the lawyers explain
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.040]   the duty of proof that somebody has to offer
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.000]   when they mandate vaccination,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.860]   the proof is simply not there, right?
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.520]   They cannot fulfill what the law requires them to fulfill
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.320]   in order to prove that something could happen.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.600]   When you listen to what the OSHA regulations say,
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.360]   like they cannot prove it.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.880]   They cannot prove that this is a,
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.040]   I can't remember what legal language,
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.720]   they cannot prove that this is a compelling danger
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.220]   for most people and they cannot prove
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.680]   that this is the best alternative, et cetera.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.200]   Like none of that stuff can be proved.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.240]   And what happens is when some,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.360]   in the court system in the United States,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.760]   when something goes into court,
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.960]   it requires a very different level of evidence
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.720]   than it does in the public space.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   You can have all kinds of things in the public space.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.480]   You can have people say all kinds of things,
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.080]   but when it actually comes down to lawyers
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.000]   submitting documents into court,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.300]   the judges don't fool around
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.940]   and the stuff actually has to be true.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.880]   It actually has to be proven.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.080]   And if it's not, it all falls apart.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.800]   You see this all the time with lawsuits.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   Politicians says, "Well, I'm gonna sue so and so."
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.280]   And they can say whatever you want.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.120]   You can say whatever you want.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.920]   You can shout on Twitter, et cetera.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.720]   But then the only thing that actually matters
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.760]   is what do the lawyers say in the court documents
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.640]   and what is the testimony in court under oath
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.420]   where there are actually penalties for lying.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.560]   And all of a sudden it's a very different scenario.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   And so on that regard, I just,
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.040]   I don't see how they can prove it
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.640]   with any of my knowledge of,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.520]   and kind of layman's observation of the data,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.320]   the studies, the arguments, the efficacy,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.840]   the actual danger of the disease for workers, et cetera.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.520]   I don't think that they win those lawsuits.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.820]   Number two, if they do win the lawsuits,
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.840]   I don't think the American people will put up with it.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.440]   I really don't.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.640]   Now, I have questioned this a lot of times.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.320]   I never thought the American people would put up
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.480]   with having their gyms closed for a year.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.740]   I never thought that they would.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.560]   I couldn't imagine it.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.200]   But I was really saddened to see that they rolled over,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.720]   businesses closed, they shut everything down,
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.400]   and they dealt with it.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.480]   I was surprised.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.760]   But I've also seen a little bit of backbone
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.600]   be stuck back up and people have said,
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.000]   "No, we're gonna keep pressing on."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.600]   And so things have gotten better along the way
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.940]   in terms of the Americans' willingness to stand up
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.480]   and just not put up with tyrants.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.760]   And so I'm happy to see that.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.400]   And that's encouraged me.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.840]   Along the way, as I've watched the mandates
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.420]   and everything that employers have put down,
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.780]   it's been an interesting conversation to watch.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.480]   I think even this week, it'll be fascinating
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.840]   to see what emerges from the airline industry.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.960]   Right now, there's a hot debate going on
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.040]   with the Southwest Airlines.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.420]   And so you have the airlines saying,
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.520]   "Oh, we're having problems with air traffic control
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.400]   "and we're having weather problems,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.480]   "so we're canceling flights."
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.020]   Meanwhile, you've got lots of text messages
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.060]   and lots of inside information and everyone saying,
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.740]   "Hey, it's because people are walking off of their jobs
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.640]   "due to vaccine mandates."
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   And yet that's generally being suppressed.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.240]   You go back and look at what happened in Australia
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.080]   a few weeks ago, right?
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.680]   The truckies had a big strike,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.520]   but the government said,
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.400]   "We're absolutely going to shut down
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.080]   "any information on this."
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.480]   And so they refused to allow the reporting on it.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.840]   Social media wasn't allowed.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.680]   And the truckies said like,
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.440]   "Look, we're striking for freedom.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.360]   "If you look on the maps,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.680]   "you can see where we've shut everything down,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.920]   "but we're just gonna keep it all quiet."
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.260]   Or at least that's the news reports that I have read.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.820]   Australians feel free to confirm or deny.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.380]   But I think that right now you see a war of information.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.660]   And when you have a war of information,
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.620]   the truth will always prevail.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.100]   You cannot hide truth.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.900]   It's never hideable.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.100]   And so the best thing to always do
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.680]   is to have your arguments and debates in public
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.820]   where the truth can come out clearly, quickly.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.380]   That results in the best thing.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.500]   But right now you don't have that.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.740]   So we'll see what happens in the coming months
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.600]   as more and more employers mandate vaccines
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.240]   and the government.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.000]   I think that most of the government regulation stuff
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.400]   is primarily a publicity coup.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.720]   It's trying to create cover for individual employers
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.800]   saying, "Hey, listen guys, you go ahead,
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.960]   "private market, you go ahead and do what we can't do."
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.760]   Think of it like this.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.920]   It's like censoring information.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.440]   What does the government do?
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.680]   Well, the government knows, in the United States,
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.680]   the government knows that the government
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.800]   is not able to restrict speech.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.720]   Can't do it legally.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.280]   First Amendment right to open speech.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   So what the government does is try to incentivize
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.600]   individual businesses and corporations
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.420]   and entities at a local level to restrict speech.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.100]   And so the goal is get Facebook to say,
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.200]   "Okay, we're not gonna do that."
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.880]   Get YouTube to scrub all arguments about,
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.240]   what was the thing they just banned?
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.680]   Vaccines, right?
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.040]   You're not gonna argue about vaccines,
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.000]   not gonna talk about vaccines.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.240]   Get YouTube to remove all the channels
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.940]   and all the videos related to anybody
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.200]   who questions a vaccination
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.640]   or wonders what vaccination schedule is right.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.040]   Get YouTube to do it.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   And so the government uses its winking authority
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.560]   to say, "We'll give you cover to do what we can't do."
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.580]   And so I think basically you see the same thing
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.980]   happening right now with vaccine mandates
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.700]   that the US government is trying to give cover
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.080]   to companies and employers who are saying,
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.160]   "Yeah, we're gonna do this
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.200]   "because this is what we want to be done," et cetera.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.100]   But I don't think it works, I really don't.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.520]   If you look at, look at right now,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.580]   the situation this week with all the canceled flights
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.320]   from Southwest Airlines.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.900]   People have no concept of how easily
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.460]   the entire American society could be shut down
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.460]   by a few angry, organized, coordinated people.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.960]   The one that I always think about
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.600]   is I always think about when I was younger,
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.260]   there was the Maryland shooter.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.760]   If you remember this story,
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.840]   there was a shooter in the Washington DC area
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.500]   who was shooting people on the street
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.020]   with seemingly no rhyme or reason.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.880]   I forget how many people he killed, handful of people.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.880]   The entire Capitol was shut down
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.100]   for a couple weeks at least, I think.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.880]   A couple weeks at least for one guy with a gun.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.540]   One guy with a gun.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.180]   People were scurrying around, scared to be outside,
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:38.940]   everything was shut down for weeks with one guy with a gun
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.120]   who was angry and shooting people on the street randomly.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.580]   Now, imagine in the United States
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.140]   where you have a few thousand people
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.620]   or a few hundred people who decide,
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:53.680]   you know what, I'm done with this,
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.560]   and they start doing crazy stuff
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.020]   and just gumming up the works of the wheels of government.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.700]   Right now, it's really easy stuff to do.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.160]   Right now, it's, hey, I'm not gonna go to work today.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.500]   And look at the chaos that ensues.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.340]   And just imagine if a few hundred people start going beyond.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.060]   Now, I think those kinds of people
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.900]   are just sitting back and watching and waiting
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.300]   and saying what actually happens.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.060]   But there is a line, and whenever the public decides
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.380]   that's enough, the public is the one
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.060]   who has all of the power, right?
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.020]   That's where all the power is,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.260]   especially in a country like the United States.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.580]   The people allow the government to go
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.280]   as far as they believe the government should go,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.660]   and then things change.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.820]   And you can't predict where that line is.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.500]   You can't predict it, because a lot of it
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.860]   has to do with crowd dynamics, right?
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.580]   I'll just say, for me, I have not been involved
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.460]   in, I never protested against masks.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.660]   I didn't say I'm not gonna wear one.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.180]   I admire people who did, but to me,
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.700]   I'm like, eh, okay, no big deal, wear a mask.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.620]   I'll be polite, I'll be kind.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.580]   I don't, you know, I just wanna be kind to others.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.500]   Maybe I can protect others.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.660]   Maybe it does do some good,
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.420]   even though the box says it does no good.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.460]   Maybe it does do some good.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.780]   Maybe statistically, if enough people do it,
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.700]   it will bend the curve, and this seems like an easy,
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.460]   an easy thing that I can do.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.420]   So I do it.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.340]   And I respect those who refuse to comply,
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.500]   and I respect those who absolutely say,
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.780]   we're gonna wear a mask no matter what.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.940]   That's fine, it's your own position.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.100]   You can do as you like.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.740]   But if you, but over the last few weeks,
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.980]   like I've changed dramatically,
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.140]   where I have become, in the past,
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:27.220]   no, oh, it's probably medical, it makes sense, et cetera.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.220]   I've become more of an extremist over the last few weeks.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.620]   No, this is enough.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.780]   This is absolutely, this makes no sense, right?
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.820]   And I look at other countries where I can see more,
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.420]   it seems more clear.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.820]   Like, it makes no sense for you
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.260]   to be imposing these things.
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.940]   It makes no sense.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.180]   Like, time and again, right?
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.900]   You have to be vaccinated
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.060]   to protect the vaccinated people, right?
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.260]   You have to get the vaccine that doesn't protect you
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.620]   from those who don't have the vaccine.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.460]   So because of that, we have to vaccinate
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.940]   all the unvaccinated people
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.340]   so the vaccinated people can be protected from the,
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.900]   it makes no sense.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.700]   And you hear people twist themselves in knots
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.540]   trying to explain it, and I followed all the medical stuff.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.220]   And like, you're an idiot.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.260]   It doesn't work.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.180]   You can't, there's no point.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.100]   And so I think it's over.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.540]   I think we're in the last bits of it
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.780]   because the people decided it's over.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.060]   And I have no intention of changing my lifestyle
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.860]   at this point in time for coronavirus stuff.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.500]   And I think that most people are in the same position,
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.820]   at least in the United States.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.020]   So I think that by maybe this winter,
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.140]   I mean, certainly we expect cases to go up this winter
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.060]   in many places in the cold climates,
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.780]   but I think that over the coming months,
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.900]   all the stuff will be gone.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.420]   They'll withdraw the regulations,
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.580]   at least in the United States,
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.740]   and things will continue forward.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.420]   I don't know about on a global basis,
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:51.420]   but I think that by next year, we'll be done.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.900]   That's my opinion.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.620]   Now, we'll see if it's right or wrong.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.860]   It's on the record now.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.740]   We can go back and listen to this in a year and see.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.500]   Certainly things could change, right?
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.980]   A new variant that proves to be more deadly,
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:10.580]   a mutation that winds up causing more destruction,
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:11.620]   all of that would change.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.340]   But at the moment,
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.140]   I think that we're pretty much done with COVID.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.820]   I think that it's endemic.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.900]   And I think that a lot of the restrictions will go away
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.700]   because in places where they're trying,
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.540]   I don't think the people are gonna put up with it.
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   And it just doesn't make any sense.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.660]   It doesn't make any sense to impose restrictions.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.620]   So let's now pivot.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:39.540]   What can you do or what do you do
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.020]   if things turn into a worse situation?
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.620]   For example, I have a significant number
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.180]   of listeners in Canada, right?
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.020]   What do you do if you're living in Canada
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.700]   and the Canadian government says,
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.020]   you can't, what did the recent couple of days ago?
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.860]   You can't go on a plane.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.300]   You can't go on a train.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.740]   You can't go on any kind of public transportation.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.500]   You can't move around
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.020]   unless you have your vaccine certificate.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.780]   Now, I don't think the Canadians
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.660]   are gonna put up with it,
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:14.660]   but the Canadians have become a lot softer than I thought.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.460]   And the same thing with Australia.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.940]   The most shocking thing to me has been Australia.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.380]   I thought the Australians were like this independent people,
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.220]   freedom-oriented, like we're tough people
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.420]   living in the outback and everything.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.020]   That was always the reputation
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.060]   that I always had of Australia.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.140]   And it doesn't seem to be the case.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.460]   I mean, you see videos of the cops knocking on people's door
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.700]   or pushing a social media post in their face.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.820]   And so I have badly misjudged the Australians evidently,
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.100]   and I don't understand.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.540]   I don't understand what's happening.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.180]   And so similar things in Canada.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.500]   So what do you do if you are being targeted?
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.860]   What do you do if you don't want to take a vaccination
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.900]   that is being forced on you
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.740]   and your employer says you have to do it?
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.780]   What do you do if the government says you have to do it?
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.340]   How can you protect yourself and prepare?
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.660]   I see this as where fundamentally everything we talk about.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.740]   One of the reasons why you build financial freedom
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.940]   in addition to other freedoms
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.100]   is so that you have the freedom
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.740]   to simply follow your conscience,
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.620]   to do what you believe is right.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.420]   People who are slaves, people who are wage slaves,
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.380]   don't have many options.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.980]   And I think it's important to recognize that,
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.420]   that the reason you build freedom
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.220]   is so that you have options when you need them.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:34.980]   Let's say there's a guy who says,
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.300]   I don't want to take a vaccine by force.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.660]   I don't think this is the best for me.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.540]   Maybe I already have natural immunity
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.060]   or I have something I'm concerned about.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.340]   I don't want to have my heart messed up
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.700]   'cause I think that the danger of having my heart messed up
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.220]   by this vaccine is worse potentially
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:55.980]   than potentially the disease.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.340]   I'd rather take my risk with the disease.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.780]   Whatever reason you decide.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:52:59.980]   I'm not your boss, I don't care.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.900]   You decide for whatever reason you want.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.500]   I'll do me, you do you.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.180]   But the guy decides he's gonna do that,
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.700]   but his boss comes along and says,
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:11.020]   yeah, on this company, we're all gonna get vaccinated.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.180]   I don't fault that guy.
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.380]   If he's got no money and he's a wage slave,
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.060]   I don't fault that guy for taking the vaccine.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.300]   To be able to support your family
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.540]   and to be able to do stuff is,
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.740]   you do what you gotta do because it makes sense.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   There are lots of laws that I follow,
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.300]   lots of things that I do that I don't think should exist,
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.020]   but I do them because, you know what?
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.780]   They're the guys with all the force and I'm gonna do it.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:38.540]   You know, I have a concealed carry permit.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.460]   I don't think you need a concealed carry permit
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.500]   to carry a gun, right?
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.820]   It is your absolute natural right for you to carry a gun
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.820]   to protect yourself and your family.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.980]   I believe in so-called constitutional carry,
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.460]   which means that, hey, you don't need anything.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.940]   Constitution says the right of the people
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.460]   to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:59.380]   I'm not gonna infringe upon you.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.180]   I'm not, if you tell me, yeah, Joshua,
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.180]   I don't have a concealed carry license,
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.300]   but you roll up your shirt
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.500]   and you show me a 45 strapped to your hip,
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.740]   I say, yeah, good for you, doesn't matter.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.020]   But I still have chosen to get a concealed carry license
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:18.060]   because I figure if I can reduce my legal risk a little bit,
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.500]   then I'm gonna do that.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.740]   And even though I don't think it should be the law,
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.500]   I'm gonna choose to do what seems best for me,
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.880]   even if it's potentially a compromise.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.300]   So I'll go ahead, I'll get the license,
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.220]   and then I'll bide my time.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.580]   And so I think about it like that, right?
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.780]   You may say, you know what?
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.540]   I don't think I really want the vaccine,
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:42.220]   but I need this job, so I'm gonna go ahead and do it.
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.460]   I think that's what you should do.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.540]   If you need to feed your family,
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.860]   you gotta make sure that you prioritize.
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.420]   And you can't be an activist on everything,
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.380]   or you wind up twisting yourself into knots.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.780]   You can't make any forward progress.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   And so I don't think that, I don't look down on you.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.140]   If you are choosing to do things,
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.620]   you don't wanna do because that's what you believe is best.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.900]   That's what allows you to have a job.
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.780]   That's what allows you to go the places you need to go.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.660]   That's what allows you to protect yourself.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.020]   That's not wrong, right?
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.300]   That's understandable,
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.340]   and that's probably the right thing to do.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.760]   I would have a hard time if I were dependent upon a job.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.620]   I would have to be really confident being an activist
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:24.420]   and walking away from that job because of something.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.580]   Respect for those who do.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.820]   I hope that if I ever have to face it,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.300]   I am that confident,
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.900]   but I don't fault you for doing it.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.500]   What I point out though is the whole reason
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.660]   you build freedom and resiliency and backup
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.100]   and options in your life
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.380]   is so that you don't have to ignore your conscience.
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:43.200]   The whole reason you build a freedom fund
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.120]   is so that when you're asked to do something unethical
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.300]   or illegal or immoral at your job,
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:52.100]   you can just walk out the door and you can not look back.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.980]   It's for the good times, but it's also for the bad times.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:59.900]   The whole reason why you stockpile food in your house
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.300]   is so that you don't have to potentially run the risk
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.940]   of going out and stealing from your neighbor
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.820]   to feed your children.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:10.540]   I understand why a man goes and steals food
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.940]   from his neighbor to feed his children.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.980]   If my children were hungry and desperate,
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.940]   I like to believe that maybe I wouldn't,
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.900]   but I'm scared that I probably would.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.980]   I probably would go and steal from my neighbor.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:23.420]   And so what you do is you put resiliency in,
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:25.500]   and you say, I don't wanna be forced in a position
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.460]   where I have to go and steal from my neighbor,
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.580]   so let me go ahead and stockpile some food from my family
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.740]   so that I can avoid that moral risk.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.140]   So by extension, what I'm saying is you prepare,
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.140]   you build freedom so that you're not forced,
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.720]   you're not subject to it.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.860]   I don't think that most Americans should leave the country
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.500]   for the reasons stated early in the show.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.700]   I think the United States
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.660]   is probably a pretty good place to be right now.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.300]   I've made a pretty good,
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:55.700]   I've made an intentional choice with regard to COVID freedom
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:57.500]   to come back to the United States right now
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.700]   because I'm tired of living under the pandemic.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.140]   I don't understand why the countries
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.740]   are not dumping all their regulations.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.080]   And at least in the United States,
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.340]   although the government has dumped its dumb regulations,
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.860]   the people have decided they're done with it,
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.740]   and I can live a normal life in the United States.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:16.460]   But maybe it does get worse.
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:19.380]   I think here, your best plan is still what I talk about.
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.420]   Number one, it's basic preparedness,
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.020]   making sure that you have money,
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.580]   making sure that you have savings,
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:27.860]   making sure that your debts are under control,
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.600]   making sure that you have food,
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   making sure that you have protection,
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.140]   making sure that you have energy resiliency.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:39.140]   Just imagine that people start rioting in a serious way.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:45.260]   Imagine that truckers in the United States decide,
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.980]   you know what, we're gonna go ahead and protest.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.300]   If you think a little bit of chaos at some airports
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.140]   and a few thousand canceled flights
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.100]   because of air traffic controllers and pilot striking
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.100]   has an impact, just imagine what a trucker strike would do.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.060]   It would shut the country down.
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.180]   It would shut the country down.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.900]   And that's just the tip of the iceberg of what could happen.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.940]   Just imagine some guys go out
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.620]   and they start cutting off power, right?
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.180]   And imagine that they sat back
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.980]   with a 22 single action or a pellet gun
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.660]   and guys start shooting power crews
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:25.020]   that go out to work on restoring the power.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:28.640]   Imagine if every power crew
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:32.380]   that's going out to fix infrastructure
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:37.020]   that a few guerrilla terrorists have destroyed
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:42.020]   to wage their protest against government overreach.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.220]   Imagine that every power crew
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.380]   has to have two or three police officers
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.740]   protecting the power crew
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:52.220]   from being shot at by random people.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.940]   And then it catches on,
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.420]   kind of like the, shall we say,
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:00.500]   the let's go Brandon chants,
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.940]   aka the FU Biden chants have taken off in the United States
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.680]   at every game you go to,
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.700]   the crowds are, to use the euphemism,
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.540]   are calling out let's go Brandon and pounding it.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:12.580]   Just imagine it comes out.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.100]   And basically the idea gets out,
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.300]   you know what, let's shut things down
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.220]   and take a few potshots here and there.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.200]   Like that kind of thing is,
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.060]   that kind of guerrilla warfare is utterly indefensible.
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.540]   There's no answer to it.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.660]   And the entire thing,
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.860]   the entire country would be paralyzed
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:30.700]   and shut down overnight, absolutely overnight.
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:33.020]   Think about a few years ago,
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:34.540]   the Dallas police shootings, right?
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.060]   One guy, one guy went out
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.960]   and started shooting police officers in Dallas.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.920]   Imagine if government health inspectors were harassed
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.720]   and people just actually decided,
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.860]   you know what, we're done with this.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:47.700]   And they start doing that.
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.880]   They would shut everything down.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   So what do you need?
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.120]   Well, you gotta be prepared to do
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.780]   without systems of support, right?
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.400]   You need food, you need water,
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.680]   you need alternative energy.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.120]   You need to be able to deal with and not go to work.
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.600]   You need money to pay your bills
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.640]   so that you can not have your house foreclosed on
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.620]   when you can't get to work because the roads are shut down.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.000]   And so the point is that we're always living
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.280]   right on that edge.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.720]   And the vast majority of the time,
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.840]   you never see it,
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.720]   but we're always living right on that edge.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.880]   Think of it like a virus.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.280]   At every single year,
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.920]   every single time through human history,
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.840]   there are millions and millions and millions of viruses
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.360]   that are mutating and mutating and changing, et cetera.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.620]   And at any point in time,
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.720]   any one of those viruses can emerge
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.540]   and cause a worldwide pandemic.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:34.520]   So that's basically the situation we live in is,
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.920]   what was it, Jonathan Edwards had the sermon, right?
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.080]   Where sinners walking across a precarious bridge
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.160]   over a lake of fire, right?
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.600]   Life is actually extremely fragile and we live on the edge.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.480]   So from a practical perspective, you save money,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.440]   you cover your bills, you control your debts,
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.280]   you make sure you're covered,
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.520]   you build resiliency in your business,
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.560]   and then you build your skillset.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.960]   Back to kind of mandates.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:01.040]   I'm trying to focus in on what do you do if you get fired?
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.720]   Right, there are lots of employers
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   who are requiring their employees to be vaccinated.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.280]   First thing you should obviously have
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.480]   is you should obviously have the ability
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.320]   to create the necessary paperwork
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.020]   that will satisfy your employer.
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.920]   In any tyrannical society,
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.560]   the way that you get life done is by knowing people.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.280]   Go and study any society that's given over to tyranny
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.620]   and you will find that many, many people
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.800]   do not obey the laws, but how do you do it?
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.200]   It's always about connections,
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.040]   it's always about network, et cetera.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.100]   You have to know who you need to talk to
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.120]   to get the paper that you need from the right person.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.440]   You have to know who you need to talk to
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.040]   who has access to the computer records to put that in.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.200]   You have to figure out how do I get the person
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.440]   the necessary payment for their services?
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.960]   This is how the world works.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.120]   This is how the world has always worked.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.480]   Some people are equal, but some are more equal than others.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.120]   It's a classic scenario, it's always that way.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.280]   And so in every society,
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.200]   there is always a way to get done what you needed.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.960]   Now what has happened is that Americans
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.620]   have been lulled to sleep by the basic expectation
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.260]   that hey, society should leave me alone.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:12.220]   And Americans have never really seen the need to know that.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.860]   They haven't ever seen like,
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.300]   why would I need to know the doctor
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.840]   who can enter in the appropriate vaccination record
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.620]   into the computer and squirt the serum into the air
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.220]   while scanning the barcode so that I can have my pass?
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.140]   Like that's just unthinkable for most Americans.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.500]   But that's the way the world works,
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.740]   is you just simply need to know the right people.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.680]   You need to know the right people
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.280]   who give you the paperwork that you need,
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.580]   who give you the passes that you need,
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:41.120]   and you need to know how to compensate them
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.980]   for their services in a way that provides them
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.580]   with plausible deniability.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.380]   Yes, I'm talking about bribing people.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.680]   That's the way the world works.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.780]   In most countries around the world,
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:54.900]   where you don't have this kind of broad, orderly scenario,
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.860]   the way that you move forward is you pay the people
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.220]   that you need to get the paperwork that you need.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.780]   Now that's different, and that's kind of a foreign concept
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.780]   in the United States.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.500]   But if we go down the road of more and more restrictions,
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:09.100]   more and more mandates, that's the fundamental foundation.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.260]   And so that's on you.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.460]   You've gotta have the friends.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.460]   You've gotta know who the contacts are.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.660]   You've gotta know the people that you need
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.940]   to get the necessary paperwork to be able to live,
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.160]   to be able to get onto an airplane,
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.240]   to be able to get onto a train, et cetera.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.060]   It might be easy in a world of paper COVID vaccine cards
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.500]   to be able to simply print out
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.660]   and scrawl out the necessary vial numbers
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.260]   and dosage numbers and address and dates and everything,
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.740]   and now you have your vaccine card.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.840]   Boom, done, et cetera.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.440]   Go on with your day.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.680]   But it might be more important in New York City
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.180]   or in San Francisco that now you need to figure out
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:45.700]   who am I gonna know who's gonna get this stuff
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.300]   entered into the computer for me.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.620]   And so you need connections.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:49.560]   You need relationships.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.640]   You need a network.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.700]   And that's something that you can be building.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.460]   Now the same exact thing is necessary for you
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.700]   when it comes to actually building
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.980]   more options for yourself.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:00.820]   Let's say that you say,
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.020]   "Listen, I'm not gonna get around.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.960]   "I'm not gonna give a fake vaccine card.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.400]   "If my employer's gonna require this,
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.780]   "I don't even wanna work here.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.960]   "Like, that's not for me."
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.180]   So you need the network, the contacts
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.900]   that you can leave the job and go and get another one.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.380]   And what I wanna tell you is right now,
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:18.560]   stop this bellyaching of whining about,
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.220]   "Oh, everything is bad and it's gonna get worse."
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.420]   There has never been a better time
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:26.740]   in the history of mankind for you
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.300]   to be able to make a fortune,
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.380]   for you to be able to provide for your family,
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.900]   for you to be safe and secure,
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.100]   for you to be free than right now.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.740]   There have never been more money-making opportunities
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:42.740]   that you and I can do from a computer in a library,
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.220]   from a Chromebook on a Starbucks Wi-Fi
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.140]   or a McDonald's Wi-Fi.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.060]   You can make a fortune simply
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.700]   with any number of businesses online.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.540]   And you can transact more freely, right?
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.660]   We, even as the rules go up,
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.140]   we're developing new alternatives to that.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.500]   The rules go up, we develop alternatives.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:10.100]   So whether it's, there's so many examples we could give.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.680]   The point is stop bellyaching and complaining
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   and stop being a doomer and a pessimistic doomer saying,
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.840]   "Oh, everything is so bad.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.700]   "What am I gonna do?
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.700]   "How am I gonna feed my family?"
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.540]   Get out, get out, right?
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.440]   Leave the company and go start your own business.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.760]   You can do it.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.720]   My words are failing me, which is frustrating.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.860]   Buy a, go buy a pressure cleaner at the store
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:42.100]   and start knocking on the doors of houses
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.020]   that clearly need a driveway pressure cleaner.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.500]   Start selling your services as a pressure cleaner.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.900]   No mandates, no restrictions, no business license needed.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.700]   All you need is a pressure cleaner.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.940]   Go online and find furniture that's old and beat up
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.220]   and buy it, paint it and resell it.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.040]   The thing that is remarkable to me
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.420]   about coming to the United States,
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.880]   one of the things that I always notice
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.900]   when I come to the United States
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.840]   is the abundance of money-making opportunities.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.720]   I was talking to a buddy of mine, he's a professional guy,
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.900]   but he was talking about how he finds himself
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.940]   just in his spare time flipping couches.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:15.500]   He's like, "It seems like I make 600,"
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.300]   he's always flip buying and replacing his furniture.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.980]   He's like, "I make 600 bucks every time I flip a couch."
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.580]   And he said, "If I wanted to, I got a pickup truck.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.780]   "I could flip a couch a week
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.180]   "and make just an easy five or 600 bucks a week
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.660]   "with flipping couches."
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.140]   And he's kind of in the market that he's in,
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.680]   in South Florida, where there's lots of high-end stuff
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.740]   and desire for high-end couches.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.980]   And my point, I respond, I was like,
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.380]   "You're absolutely right."
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.820]   One of the things about the United States
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.340]   that is so obvious is there are
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.180]   money-making opportunities everywhere, everywhere.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.900]   And they're good money-making opportunities.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.820]   They're often not glamorous,
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.660]   but they're good money-making opportunities.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.860]   When I come to the United States,
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:07:00.060]   I'm overwhelmed by the number of businesses you can do
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.580]   that are just simple things.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.420]   I'm not joking about the pressure cleaner.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.180]   Like, a simple guy with a pressure cleaner
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.080]   can make a living.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:13.420]   A guy with a handyman sign on his van
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.980]   can make a lot of money.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:19.540]   You can flip washing machines online.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.700]   You can do all, I mean, those are just simple things
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.740]   that don't require a lot of intellect.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.300]   They don't even require a computer.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.100]   A guy with a pickup truck hauling junk
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.820]   can make a thousand bucks a week.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:34.820]   So don't complain and cry and be pessimistic.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.040]   Just go out and ignore the laws
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.180]   that you don't think are right and go out and do it.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.220]   Go out and build something better.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.060]   And I think the idea here is,
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.740]   I don't have the full list of here's what you do,
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.140]   because it's all the same stuff we talk about
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.420]   all the rest of the time.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.540]   But most of what you do is in your attitude.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.740]   And I don't like seeing people cry and worry
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:59.060]   about this stuff,
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.260]   just about the mandates and all of that.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.060]   At least in the United States.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:07.340]   Guys, toughen up and get busy and go.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.220]   Go build the connections that you need
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.600]   to get the paperwork aligned
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.580]   and get your name in the appropriate computer system
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.060]   with a checkbox in it.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:18.220]   That's the obvious kind of level 101.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.580]   Most people, many people will just go ahead
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.140]   and automatically take the vaccine
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.580]   because they believe it's better for them.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.540]   That eliminates the vast majority.
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.500]   If you're in the minority
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:27.980]   and you don't want to be forced to take a vaccine,
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.020]   I'm with you.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.620]   It's stupid, it's tyrannical.
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.740]   But I don't think that it's gonna wind up
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:33.820]   being that big of a thing.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:36.380]   You just have to deal with your individual employers.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.020]   And this will blow over soon.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.060]   In the United States, the last thing I said was,
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.340]   I talked about, I don't think these laws
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:43.660]   will actually become laws.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:47.820]   If they do become laws, I think that if we've ever seen
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.000]   an opportunity for jury nullification,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.460]   this very well might be it.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.820]   Remember that in the United States of America,
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:59.580]   in the jury system, any juror can vote any way
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.860]   that he or she wants for any reason or no reason at all.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.780]   And it's hard for me to imagine
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:08.940]   that if you have this stuff actually go to trials,
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.340]   it's hard for me to imagine that every jury
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.980]   doesn't have at least one man or one woman on it
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:19.940]   who on principle refuses to ever say guilty
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.660]   for anybody who's broken a law related
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.440]   to the vaccine mandate.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.640]   I think that takes off.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   And I think that today in a world of social media,
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.660]   where someone can, if we actually get trials
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.460]   and people start popularizing that,
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.620]   and you just have jury after jury after jury,
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.900]   hung or a hung jury because of no ability
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.060]   to come to a thing, the whole thing falls apart.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.140]   And that's the ultimate check and balance
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.500]   in the US American system, is that you have,
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.780]   the juries are ultimately in charge
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.260]   of what actually happens.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.580]   The politicians can write any laws that they want.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.780]   The people can choose whether they follow them or not.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.380]   And they choose whether they follow them
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.380]   based upon the incentives
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.140]   and based upon their own good nature.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.140]   And so people follow the vaccine laws
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.060]   because they believe that the vaccines are good for them
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:06.380]   because, hey, we've got good short-term safety data.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.900]   They seem to be saving lives for many people.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.100]   And so most people follow them.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:15.300]   But I still think, today I'm more confident
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.760]   than I was a year ago, but I think that the Americans
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.380]   will stand up and reject the overall tyranny.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.580]   There are a lot of people right now
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:28.580]   who are fully vaccinated, who refuse to participate
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.460]   in vaccination schemes because of the principle of things.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.580]   So I think we're good, I think we're safe.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.700]   And then finally, the ultimate check and balance
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.620]   is jury nullification.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.860]   And I think there's definitely enough people
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.620]   that would just simply consistently vote
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.980]   to vacate any enforcement, any penalties
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.740]   for anybody who's ever prosecuted
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.540]   for any of this COVID restriction stuff.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.320]   If you can actually get it to a jury trial,
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.820]   I think that we're good to go.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.380]   So those are my opinions on it.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:57.220]   I know that, I hope that it's useful to you.
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.720]   I've tried to label this show clearly.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.580]   Sometimes I worry about,
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.240]   there's not enough financial planning in this,
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.440]   but it is a big deal.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.660]   What I wanna point out to you is simply
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.780]   that all the stuff you do for every other emergency
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.660]   still applies in this current one.
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:12.020]   And so don't be downhearted, don't be depressed.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.440]   Press forward and fight.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.600]   Build the life that you want
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.100]   so that you can ignore most of the mandates
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.220]   so you can go where things are better.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.300]   And I guess I didn't talk much about fleeing
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.820]   'cause I think the United States is a good place,
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.820]   but I tell you is keep your passports up to date.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.460]   There are a bunch of Canadians
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.500]   who have successfully fled to the United States.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.420]   And who knows, maybe someday there'll be a bunch
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:36.080]   of Americans who successfully fleed to Albania.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.920]   By the way, Americans can go
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.780]   on a 365-day tourist visa to Albania.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.720]   So if you are looking for a country,
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.980]   but from all I haven't been there,
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:48.500]   all of my research when I was trying to get out
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.940]   of the Western Europe craziness,
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.060]   and I was asking in various travel groups,
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.500]   I asked, I said, "Where do you go
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.460]   "to get out of these ridiculous mandates
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:00.080]   "and occupancy laws and everything shut down?
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.700]   "I'm just tired of it."
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.380]   One of the strong answers I got was,
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.280]   Albania and Eastern Europe.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.420]   And so all of my data says
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:10.820]   that the Albanians don't really care much about COVID
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.860]   and Albanians like Americans.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.060]   Again, you can come in and be in Albania
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:20.060]   for a 365-day tourist visa without any problem.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.080]   So if you're looking for a place to go
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.100]   and you need to get out of the United States,
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.940]   tuck that away and consider Albania
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:27.100]   right on the Mediterranean Sea.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.420]   You can rent yourself a little beautiful seaside villa
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:33.020]   and build your internet business living
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.020]   in your inexpensive seaside villa on the Mediterranean Sea.
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:38.620]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.780]   Hope this has been useful to you.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:43.940]   Let's talk about kind of where I see things going.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:47.860]   I think we're pretty much getting to the clear of the thing.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.220]   I didn't talk about the 700,000 dead.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.080]   I need to cover that.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.340]   I will be fascinated 15 years from now
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.100]   to read some of the books, okay?
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.500]   Because here is the weak point
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.800]   in kind of the freedom argument.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.940]   It's too important of a point to not cover.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:09.620]   The Australian government believes
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:14.140]   that what it is doing is in the ultimate best interest
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.560]   of the people because said government is protecting life.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:24.060]   That we're gonna turn our country into a large-scale prison.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.540]   We're gonna bankrupt businesses left, right, and center.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.980]   We're going to destroy any concept of freedom.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.740]   We're not gonna let our own citizens leave the country
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:38.500]   without an approval from the government.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.620]   But we're gonna do it because it's gonna save lives
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.500]   and we're gonna have a low death toll.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.780]   It'll be interesting to see
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.620]   if that does turn out to be the case.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.260]   That will be a fascinating data to see.
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:56.980]   You can compare that with the Americans
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.940]   who have a death toll of, again, 700,000 people.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.900]   And you can wait and see and say,
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.100]   okay, well, maybe the Americans said, you know what?
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.060]   We're not gonna, we're gonna stick to our freedom.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.340]   We're not gonna social distance.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:11.420]   We're not gonna wear our masks.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.420]   We're not gonna take a vaccine.
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:18.100]   We're just going to live free and we're gonna die.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.140]   History will be the judge.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.940]   There are too many factors
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.660]   that are kind of interfering factors
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:32.760]   to make any obvious argument, in my opinion, at the moment.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.500]   There's no way that you can argue that, for example,
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.220]   well, the American death toll is all because of this.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.060]   There are many reasons.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.820]   Americans are fatter than many people,
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:47.260]   more old people with other diseases than many other places,
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.500]   a very different structure
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.420]   than an island in the middle of nowhere.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.580]   And so I'm super interested in that topic.
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.860]   But I think here you have the classic argument
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.300]   between risk and safety.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:04.500]   Imagine a beautiful lion
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.500]   that is locked behind the bars of a zoo.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.100]   And you say to the lion,
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:14.380]   would you rather be here in perfect peace and safety
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:19.020]   in your 100 square meter cage, locked behind the bars,
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.820]   fed an easy diet where it shows up
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.680]   and you just simply have to eat it,
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.800]   or would you rather be out in the savanna
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.200]   with dangers on all sides,
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.220]   people coming through, hunting you, et cetera,
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:32.540]   but be out on the savanna?
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:37.260]   The life expectancy of a lion in captivity
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.980]   is much higher than the life expectancy
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.500]   of a lion in the savanna.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.540]   And yet I think most of us would rather see the lion
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.580]   have the choice and be placed out on the savanna
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.380]   versus behind the bars of a zoo.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.260]   That's life.
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:56.460]   And the older I get, the more I realize
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:00.620]   that it's not the number of years that you live
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.180]   that really makes the difference
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.600]   in your satisfaction with your life.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.500]   Rather, it's the amount of living
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.120]   and the quality of living that you do
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.400]   in the years of your life that make the difference.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.540]   An appropriate balance seems right.
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.880]   I try to avoid certain things
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.820]   that I think are distinctly physically dangerous.
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.100]   I do my best, but the older I get,
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:28.140]   the less I care about the number of years that I live,
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:31.180]   and the more I care about the life that I live
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:35.020]   during the years that I live.
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.820]   If you remember, I did the show
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:40.060]   about my friend who died of COVID,
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:43.020]   and he was late 60s.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.620]   I forget if he was 68 or 69, something like that.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.020]   Died of COVID.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:50.420]   He lived 69 years, but he managed to pack,
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:53.340]   in my estimation, maybe 15 years of living
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:56.080]   into his almost 70 years.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.820]   That death rocked me hard.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.580]   Not the death, meaning, as I stated publicly
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:07.220]   and I did that show, that death affected me
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.500]   because it showed me crystal clear
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.500]   what a tragedy not living is as compared to dying.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.700]   And it showed me that here's my friend
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:21.460]   who died of COVID, or at least he died
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.660]   while being infected with COVID.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.620]   I don't know.
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.940]   I think it's probably a legit COVID death.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.500]   He had many of the symptoms, went to the hospital,
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.180]   did the test, he's got COVID.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:37.200]   So the point is, here's my friend who died of COVID,
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.400]   but he died never having really lived.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:47.100]   And I think that it's much more important
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.020]   to think about the way that you live
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.740]   than the way that you die.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.820]   Or said differently, it's much more important
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:57.660]   to think about the way that you live
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.360]   than the date that you die.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.380]   And so that doesn't mean that you have to be prudent,
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.780]   that you have to be imprudent.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.460]   It doesn't mean that you go into a
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:12.980]   COVID-filled household just willy-nilly,
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.020]   especially when you don't know anything
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.980]   about your own risk.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:19.220]   I'm not saying that you'd be foolish.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.620]   That's where you wanna be thoughtful and be careful.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.740]   But when you look at the world of the living and the dying,
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:31.700]   I look at it as a pretty clear example
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.620]   when I think about the United States right now
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.380]   versus Australia.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:40.380]   I think about it like the lions behind the bars
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   versus the lions on the savanna.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.180]   And it's not a perfect analogy.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.580]   I'm not, don't make it more than what you do.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:52.160]   You and I all have to think about how it applies.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.080]   But the older I get, the more concerned I am
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.080]   with how I'm living versus when I die.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.900]   And when I do die, I want it to be said at my funeral
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.600]   that I really lived,
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:14.960]   not the focus being on the fact that I died.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.140]   Make of that what you will.
