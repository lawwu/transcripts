[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   there's a big mismatch between what model architecture people in industry need, given the data that is available to them,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.280]   as well as given the types of problems that they're trying to solve, and the research that's becoming available.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.560]   This is something that I hadn't really thought about before.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.320]   Researchers have access to unstructured data. They have access to things like ImageNet.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.680]   They don't have access to high volumes of data on user sessions, or logs, metrics, and events,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.880]   and the data sets that tend to be the lifeblood of most companies.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:53.560]   And it is very difficult to innovate on AI techniques or data sets to which you have zero access.
