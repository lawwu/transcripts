[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.880]   Today we're learning about learning, looking at learning as a crucial part to the Christian life,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.480]   lifelong learning specifically is what we're talking about today. The discipline is essential
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.720]   for local churches as well, so much so I'm reminded of APJ 1804, Pastor John, where you
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.680]   encouraged pastors to build a lifelong learning habit into their churches so that as God's people
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.800]   disperse out into the world after that Sunday gathering, when they go out into all their
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.680]   various professions and fields of influence, they can learn how to bring biblical truth to bear
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.440]   in the world at school, at work, without expecting the pastor to be the expert to answer all the
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.040]   ethical challenges that they will uniquely face in the world. And so pastors are equippers
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.280]   getting their people ready to make wise and discerning decisions in their lives. And to do
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.520]   this well, it requires a congregation to learn how to learn on their own. For the next few weeks,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.240]   we are going to focus on this discipline of lifelong learning, and we focus here because,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.880]   well, it's an important theme, and we focus here because it's the theme of your brand new book
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.600]   titled "Foundations for Lifelong Learning, Education in Serious Joy." In this new book,
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.000]   as to be expected, Pastor John, you employ hundreds of Bible texts to make your points,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.040]   over 500 citations throughout this little book. But of the most frequently cited texts in this
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.920]   new book that I see include two texts that stand out, Matthew 13, 13 and Psalm 34, 8,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.720]   texts that also factor prominently in your book, "Reading the Bible Supernaturally."
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.160]   So that leads me to ask this question. In your mind, how do these two books and these two
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.200]   different themes work together? What are the similarities and what are the differences between
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.480]   talking about Bible study on one hand, in "Reading the Bible Supernaturally," and the purpose of
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.640]   education more broadly, which is the theme of "Foundations for Lifelong Learning"? How does
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.480]   the wise study of Scripture set the stage for us to be wise Christian students of all of life?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.640]   In your new book, you write a statement that really stood out to me. You said,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.840]   "If we never observe the world through books, especially the book, we will be very limited
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.720]   in what we can know." Expand on that. Let me see if I can take all those threads.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:51.120]   That's a lot of different threads. And weave them into some kind of coherent fabric of an answer.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.240]   So let's start with quoting those two passages. I mean, I found this really helpful the way you
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   posed the question. It was really helpful for me to think on how the books relate and how those
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.200]   texts relate to the two books. So let's start by quoting those two passages and relate them to the
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.960]   two books. Matthew 13, 13 says, Jesus says, "This is why I speak to them in parables, because
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.680]   seeing they do not see, seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:31.280]   understand." And I'm pretty sure that the reason this text is a common question for our APJ
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:41.680]   listeners is because Jesus says he's actually aiming to conceal things by his parables from
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.040]   people who are resistant to truth. A couple of verses later, he says, "This people's heart has
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:59.840]   grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes have closed, lest they should
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.040]   see with their eyes and hear with their ears." But then Jesus says to his disciples, "But blessed
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:16.640]   are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear." So the point is that there are two
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.840]   kinds of seeing. Seeing they do not see. Seeing is one kind of seeing they do not see. That's
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:32.560]   another kind of seeing. Now, Psalm 34, 8, the other text you mentioned, gives the key to the
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:42.880]   difference between a seeing that sees and a seeing that does not see. It says, "Oh, taste and see
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:52.240]   that the Lord is good," which I take to mean that there is a seeing which is also a tasting of the
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:01.280]   goodness of God, and that tasting of the goodness of God is the other kind of seeing. So some people
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.480]   read the story of the gospel of Christ. He dies for us. He rises triumphant. He reigns.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.520]   And they see these facts. They see them. They see them. But they taste no goodness at all.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.240]   These facts don't taste good and delightful and pleasing and satisfying. They don't taste
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.160]   anything pleasant. Their spiritual taste buds are dead. The only kind of seeing they have is
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.840]   natural seeing, seeing with the eyes of the head, the mind, nothing supernatural, nothing spiritual,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.200]   nothing from the Holy Spirit. But someone else reads the story of the gospel, and that person
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:55.280]   tastes the sweetness of it, the goodness of it. They taste and see, and this is the second seeing.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:03.760]   Paul calls it seeing with the eyes of the heart, Ephesians 1, 18. God has worked a miracle. He has
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:13.360]   made the taste buds of the soul alive. It's not nonsense to say taste and see. I mean, suppose I
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:21.680]   tell you this dessert is really rich, and you say, "Well, I'll take your word for it." And I say, "No,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:30.000]   no, no. Taste it." And you taste it, and you say, "Oh, I see." Now, that's not nonsense, right?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:40.400]   You see. That's what happens when we hear the gospel and God makes our spiritual taste buds
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:49.200]   alive. We taste and say, "Oh, I see. This is wonderful." So now here's the connection between
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   those two verses and the two books that you mentioned. The new book is called Foundations
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   for Lifelong Learning, subtitled Education in Serious Joy, and the older book, Reading the Bible
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.760]   Supernaturally. There are two main differences between the books. The new book, Foundations for
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:16.640]   Lifelong Learning, is built entirely and explicitly around six habits of mind and heart that form the
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:27.040]   foundations of lifelong learning or education. But these habits are only assumed and implicit
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.720]   in the earlier book, Reading the Bible Supernaturally. That's one difference. So,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:40.000]   assumed in the earlier book, made explicit, built around them in the second book. The other difference
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.320]   is that the newer book applies these six habits of mind and heart not just to the Bible, but to both
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:58.240]   of God's books, the Bible and the world. So, Reading the Bible Supernaturally is about how
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:05.040]   to read the Bible, and Foundations for Lifelong Learning is about how to read the Bible and how
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:12.320]   to read the world. So, it's built around the question, what habits of mind and heart are
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:20.480]   necessary for lifelong learning from the world, learning from the world as well as from the Bible?
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:29.760]   The six habits of mind and heart that form the foundation of lifelong learning are observation,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:39.920]   understanding, evaluation, feeling, application, and expression. There's a chapter on each of those
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:48.000]   and how they are a, at least to my taste buds, a delicious challenge for a lifetime of learning
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.760]   from the Word and from the world. This is what we try to do at Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:04.800]   build these six habits of mind and heart into our students so they are catapulted into a lifetime
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.880]   of fruitful learning. That's what I hope is happening on every APJ as well.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:18.320]   Now, the reason those two texts, Matthew 13, 13 and Psalm 34, 8 are relevant to these two books
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:26.800]   is that the problem of seeing but not seeing is a problem not only for what we see in the Bible,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:34.160]   but also what we see in the world. In other words, not only do people look at the gospel
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:42.720]   and fail to see the beauty of its reality, but people also look at the birds and the lilies
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.840]   and the ants digging in the ground and fail to see the beauty of the reality that God has designed
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:57.440]   for them to see and what He means to communicate. Some people will say that if we would just study
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:04.960]   our Bibles more and more carefully, we wouldn't have to study the world. Now, not to put it too
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   strongly, that's crazy. Not only because the Bible assumes on every page, I mean, virtually
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.440]   every page, the Bible assumes that we have looked at the world and learned from it so that we know
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:28.880]   what the Bible is talking about when it refers to vineyards, wine, weddings, lions, bears, horses,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.520]   dogs, pigs, grasshoppers, constellations, businesses, wages, banks, fountains, rivers,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:43.920]   fig trees, olive trees, thorns, wind, bread, armies, sword, shields, sheep, shepherds, cattle,
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:51.520]   camels, fire, green wood, dry wood, hay, stubble, jewels, gold, silver, law courts, judges,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:11:01.760]   and advocates, for starters, right? I mean, the Bible assumes we've got our eyes open and are
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:09.120]   looking carefully at the world and learning what things are and how they work and at society,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.920]   that we have a great store of knowledge of things of the world when we come to the pages of
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.320]   Scripture. And not only that, not only does the Bible assume that we have paid close attention to
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.680]   the world that we live in, it commands us to go back to the world and learn. Go to the aunt,
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:37.440]   you sluggard, like sluggard reading the Bible, go to the aunt and consider her ways and be wise,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:44.240]   learn from her diligence, look at the birds of the air and learn how your father will take care
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.920]   of you, consider the lilies of the field and learn how your father will clothe you.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:12:00.160]   And the relevance of those texts, Matthew 13 and Psalm 34, is that millions of people seeing do
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:08.800]   not see when they look at the world. They see birds and lilies and ants and sunrises and stars,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.080]   bright blasts of God's glory everywhere, and they don't see it. They don't see God,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:27.040]   they don't see his glory and what he's revealing. So the good effects of Bible seeing and world
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:37.120]   seeing go both directions. If you see the world accurately, you will bring a fund of knowledge
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.360]   to the Bible that will enable you to know many things, many of the kinds of things it's talking
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:51.280]   about. But even more importantly, and you picked up on this, Tony, in the last part of your question,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:13:00.320]   even more importantly, if in reading the Bible, God gives us eyes to see the glory of Christ,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:10.400]   to taste and see that he's good, then when we turn to the world and look with these new eyes,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:19.280]   the birds and the lilies and the ants and the sunrises and the stars, they all have a new
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   message. They have a new glory. They show us something of God. So that's what I want for myself.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.560]   That's what I want for our students at Bethlehem College and Seminary. That's what I want for
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:41.280]   everyone who reads this book. That's what I want every time you and I talk on this podcast for our
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:51.600]   listeners. When we see the word and when we see the world, to really see, to taste and see
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:59.520]   that the Lord is good, the Lord is glorious. Yeah. Amen. Truly understanding the world
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.920]   in what it says of God is essential for comprehending the Bible better and vice versa,
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.400]   all leading to the delight of learning. There's an essential feeling, an essential joyfulness that
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.200]   we aim at in all of our learning. I think, Pastor John, you're sort of getting at that. You're
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.800]   pushing in that direction towards the end of this episode, and I want to pick up on that theme next
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.440]   time. Thank you, Pastor John. Thank you for joining us today. If you have a question for
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.840]   Pastor John, ask him. Type out your question as briefly as possible and email it to me at
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:37.200]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Monday,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.360]   learning for joy. That's the theme next. See you then.
