[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   An anonymous woman writes to ask, "My life as a Christian seems to be causing a greater
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.680]   and greater divide with my unsaved husband and young adult children.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.600]   How do I stay faithful to God and live peacefully with my family?
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.520]   I've been praying for their salvation for years."
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.840]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   Well, there aren't any pains in life greater than the pain of family pain and children
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.480]   pain and marriage pain.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.240]   I've often said in the ministry to Noel, "You know, if you're happy at home, Noel, I can
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.680]   endure anything at church."
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.800]   And I think that's the way a lot of spouses feel.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.920]   Like if work is bringing them misery or if society is bringing them misery and they have
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.760]   a place to go at home where there's peace and harmony, they can almost stand anything.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.920]   But if the home is broken, then where do you turn?
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.040]   So I totally resonate with the urgency and the pain of these kinds of situations.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.400]   So the first thing that comes to my mind is that Jesus said, "It's going to be this way
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.900]   for some of us."
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.640]   In Matthew 10, "I did not come, do not think I came to bring peace on the earth.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.440]   I came to bring a sword."
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.560]   And then he illustrated that by saying, "A man is going to be turned against his son
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.840]   and a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.840]   Your enemies will be those of your own household."
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.560]   So what this woman is experiencing was totally foreseen by Jesus.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.880]   And he says, "It's just going to happen."
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.080]   As the gospel enters into the world, it doesn't always neatly save couples.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.200]   It saves one half of the couple.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.280]   It saves a son or it saves an uncle.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.040]   And then there's pain, then there's division as tension begins to happen.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.960]   The text that addresses her situation most clearly, of course, is 1 Peter 3, where you
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:19.520]   have Peter very concerned to help a wife who's been saved and her husband is not with her
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.740]   in this.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.320]   And as I've reflected on that text, the center of it seems to be to tell her that
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.880]   the holy women of old, giving her an example, hoped in God.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.720]   And he was contrasting it with hoping in flirting or hoping in fixing her hair a certain way
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.280]   or hoping in being sexy enough for her husband.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.020]   A woman who wants to win her husband, it's saying, "Don't put your eggs in that basket."
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.360]   And I don't think that means she should let herself go and not be pretty and not be attractive,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.300]   but rather it says, "Focus your attention on hoping in God."
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.540]   And the fruits of that that it spells out for a wife who's in a situation like this
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.860]   is that hope, that resting in the great sovereign goodness and grace and omnipotence and wisdom
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.940]   of God is she'll have a quiet spirit, she'll be still and know that he is God, she won't
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.220]   be anxious, she'll have a gentle spirit, I don't think she'll be panicked, she won't
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.720]   become manipulative, she won't be forceful or demanding, the family won't experience
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.340]   her as a tyrant, they'll experience, "Mom seems quietly content in her spirit, she seems
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.700]   to have a sweet peace over her."
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.500]   The third thing it says is that she'll do good, that means she'll be a servant, and
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.140]   I think in the home you get an example of, "Let your light shine before men that they
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.540]   may see your good deeds."
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.460]   So this is an application to a believing wife, to an unbelieving family, "Let them see
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.380]   your good deeds, serve them faithfully in all the ways that a wife and a mom can."
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.340]   And the last thing it says is, "And don't be afraid of any fear."
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.500]   So they're going to see mom as unbelievably strong, she's got a fearlessness about her,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   she can laugh at the future like Proverbs 31 says about the godly woman, and it struck
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.980]   me as remarkable that when 1 Peter says in chapter 3 verse 15, which is a little bit
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.380]   later, it says, "Always be ready to give an answer for the people who ask you about
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.340]   the hope that is in you."
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.300]   Well why would they even ask a mom about the hope that is in her?
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:02.580]   And the answer is because they've seen a kind of quiet, gentle, serving, fearless strength
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.620]   in this mom.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.380]   She's brokenhearted in one sense, and yet God the Holy Spirit is giving her grace through
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.940]   the hope of the gospel to press on in all these attractive ways.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:23.620]   So my counsel to her would be to trust Him, trust the Lord Jesus to give you your heart's
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.220]   desire as you make Him your heart's desire.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.860]   I know that's a little tricky, because the Bible says, "Delight yourself in the Lord
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.300]   and He'll give you the desires of your heart," Psalm 37, verse 4.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.820]   And so I'm saying, trust Him to give you the desires of your heart as you more and more
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.220]   make Him the desire of your heart.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.820]   And I know the desire of her heart is the conversion of her husband and the conversion
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.060]   of her kids, and I'm saying trust Him like that, to give you the desire of your heart
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.380]   as you make Him more and more the desire of your heart.
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.740]   And then look to Jesus as He says, "Look, if you being evil, Mom, know how to give good
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.380]   things to your children and your husband, your Heavenly Father will give good things
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.620]   to you when you ask Him."
