[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   When I was thinking of the brief word to introduce our speaker, there's many things I could say.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Dr Lloyd-Jones was my minister for a number of years, and most of us here this evening, a goodly number of us,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   would probably have met him before and heard him before. I know he wouldn't want me to say any more than that,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   but we consider it a privilege and an honour that Dr Lloyd-Jones has consented to come and seek to answer the question
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   which we have set to him, which is, "Is there an answer to the permissive society?"
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Somebody said to me quite rightly yesterday, "I'm sick of the permissive society," but I think the operative word is "an answer."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I remember some years ago in this village, there was a young student who came to me.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   He was responsible for arranging the debate of the University of London on the new morality,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   when this permissive society, or the beginning of it, was becoming evident in our city.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   He came to me and said, "I've got a problem, Mr Bassett." He said, "We've got a debate on the new morality,"
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   or as it is being called, perhaps more correctly, the immorality, or the old immorality.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   He said, "I've got no problem in getting eminent debaters to propose and to second the new morality,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   but I can't get anybody to speak against it." I might have approached you then,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   but actually I did give him two speakers on that occasion.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   But I can say tonight that when we were considering who should speak upon this subject,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I personally, from 14 years' experience, had no doubt in my mind who was the person to speak.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I'm delighted that the first person I asked, Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones, readily consented to come and to speak to you,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and he is only too willing to receive questions afterwards.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It is a great privilege to have you, Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones, and we wait upon you now.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Mr Bassett and ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy indeed to be here and to speak on this particular subject.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Mr Bassett has told you of how my son-in-law is now a knight,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and I'm here as the representative of the common men.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I have only one brother and he's a knight, so that I'm surrounded by knights,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and as I say, my role in life is to represent the common men, and I'm very happy to do so.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   But I'm particularly glad to be here with my friend Mr Bassett,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and I felt I couldn't refuse this request that came from him that I should speak on this particular subject.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I also am very tired of it. We all must be getting very tired of this term.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But though it irritates us and we do get annoyed about it, that doesn't help to deal with it.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And after all, we are confronted by a fact, and it is our business and duty, all of us as citizens of the country apart from anything else,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   to be concerned about this, and to try to discover if we can, whether there is an answer to this.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Well, now, how do we proceed to face it?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Well, my method of facing a problem is something like this.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm naturally concerned about it as a Christian minister.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I'm also concerned about it because of my medical past and my continuing interest in things medical and medical literature, and so on.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So that from every angle, I'm concerned about it.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Now, I think it's very important that we should be clear in our minds as to what is meant by this term 'permissive', the permissive society.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   What does this mean exactly?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   These clichÃ©s and so on often get bandied about, and sometimes people are not quite clear as to what they connote and what they stand for.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So it's important we should understand that we're not dealing merely with wrong conduct or wrong behaviour, or what the Bible would call sin.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   It isn't that. It includes that, but it's more than that.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   The difference between permissiveness and sin, for me to use a familiar term, I would say is this, that sin is in a sense natural.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It arises from our constitution, our nature.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Whereas what we are discussing tonight really doesn't go under the category of natural in that way.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   What one means by sin is that a man does something and he has a feeling that it's wrong, but he still wants to do it and he likes to do it, and so he does it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But he is apologetic about it and, as I say, is aware of a sense of self-condemnation.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It arises in this natural sense from what he is.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   But what we're dealing with tonight doesn't go into that category at all.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   This, what we're confronted by now, is an isolation of one aspect of life, namely the sex aspect.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   This is being isolated, it's taken out of its context, and it's being considered as something in and of itself.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And it means, in addition to that, a definite flouting of laws.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   This is a part of what is meant by this term.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   It is not simply a man doing something that he feels he'd like to do or an urge to do, doing it in a semi-guilty manner.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   It's a very deliberate action.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It's a delight in doing what is wrong, and it's an exalting of this into the thing to do, and a boasting of it.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We're confronted really by what can be called a cult.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And to me the serious thing about it is that it is something which is contrary to nature, and it is abnormal.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'm granting that what is called sin is not contrary to nature.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I put it under the category of natural, though wrong.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But here we're dealing with something, I would say, from beginning to end, under the term permissive, which is contrary to nature.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now, I mean this.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I'm not only thinking of the perversions, and we are hearing a great deal about perversions at the present time.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Well, the very term itself suggests to us that this is something that goes against nature, contrary to it, not arising out of it, but going against it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And I'm not only thinking of perversions in that way, but I'm prepared to argue that the freedom of talk concerning these matters at the present time is also contrary to nature.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I would lay it down as a postulate that the average person, the natural person, knows a kind of natural modesty.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   This isn't merely the result of custom.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's innate in us, that there are certain things that are secret to us and private, and therefore we don't flaunt these things and we don't talk about them.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   There are certain things that we instinctively feel that we shouldn't do.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But now, this condition we are confronted by today deliberately cuts across that.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It despises that.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It denounces that.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And it quite voluntarily and deliberately goes against all this, so it's abnormal, contrary to nature.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Indeed, it has the characteristics of a cult.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And as you know, these things are not only being said and done, people are actually glorying in it.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   That's what we mean then by this permissiveness and this permissive society.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's something new, we're all aware of that.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   How has it arisen?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   I think this is a little bit important.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And I think this is a matter which is showing itself in many realms at the present time.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Owing to the power of the press and owing to certain media of communication, like the television and the radio and so on,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   it is possible today for a very small number of people to have a very great and a very wide influence.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And as I have been observing this phenomenon, I would say that all this talk about permissiveness and this modern problem
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   has resulted from the activities of a very small number of people.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   They're very clever people.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I would have thought that the ringleaders are journalists.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And especially since journalists have had opportunities by going into the television service and the radio service and so on,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   as so many of them have done.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And they have been the leaders in this, and together with them, of course, a certain number of philosophers,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and particularly those who have taken an interest in and have been practitioners of various forms of psychological treatment.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   But these are the men, the intellectuals.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   They regard themselves as intellectuals.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   You're familiar with the term "the Bloomsbury set" before the war, before the last war.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   They were, in a way, the pioneers in all this.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They were literary people, primarily.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   There were some men.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   There was a man like Maynard Keynes, afterwards Lord Keynes.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   He belonged to the same group, but though he was a great economist, essentially, like most members of his family,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   he was a literary man and a very good writer.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And the people who really led in this have been literary people on the whole,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   including, under that category, the journalists also.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Now, they have been the people who produced this situation.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   They have written their articles.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Some of them have produced plays.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And they have written books.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And they get it in.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And being in positions of control in these public media, and also, of course, on the stage and so on, all this has come in.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   But that isn't the only explanation.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   That's the main explanation, perhaps.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   But even that, I think, would have accomplished nothing, were it not for the obvious, evident decline
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   in religious influence, the decline in church attendance,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   the decline in reading and studying the Bible and being concerned about the biblical point of view.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   The religious influence has been patently on the way throughout this present century,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and especially since the end of the last war.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Now, there is the condition, and that is how it's come into being.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   But why should we consider this?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Is it worth our while to do what we're doing here tonight?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And there are so many, and especially the leaders in this movement, would say that we're making a fuss about nothing,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   that there's nothing wrong in all this, that really this is liberation.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   In fact, a very prominent statesman a couple of years back was bursting, you see, of how we've achieved, in the last decade or so, a civilized society.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And what he was producing as proof of the civilized society was the enactment by an act of parliament of the findings of the Wolfenden Report on some of these perversions,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and the abortion bill and things of this description.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   This is regarded as emancipation, as civilization.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   This is the hallmark of true culture, and we have achieved, they say, a cultured state of society.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   So, far from being worried and troubled about this and having a meeting to discuss it and to consider,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   is there any answer to it or is there any antidote to it, they say you ought to rejoice in it and be very pleased about it.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And this is, of course, what so many of them say.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   There's a well-known philosopher, Professor A.J. Ayer.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   He's a humanist and a sesson, delights in it, and his teaching is that the old idea that you have a certain set standard of moral values is quite wrong.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That every man determines his own morals.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   That we are responsible human beings, and therefore we've all got some kind of sense of right and wrong in us,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   whatever it may have come from, and that we don't need instruction, and we don't need any kind of collection or tabulation of rules and regulations.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   That every man determines his own morals.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   He is a responsible man and he lives in society, and you must leave it to him.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   That's one of their defenses for this.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   So, it is an anti-law movement and an anti-morals movement in that sense.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And they justify it in that way, that in the past, the church in particular has been a kind of incubus,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   hanging heavily upon the human race, and that people have not been given liberty to live their own lives.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   This started out in a great desire and demand for what was called self-expression.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Express yourself. Be confident in yourself.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   The idea was that religion had kept people down.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I'm not thinking of the extreme form of that in communism, which describes it as the opiate of the people.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   But the same idea was very current, and people felt and said that, well, now we've grown out of all that.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   A man has come of age and you must let every man decide how to live according to his own ideas.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   If you don't treat him like that, you're still treating him as a child and you're insulting him.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And another argument which is used, and I came across it quite recently, at least comparatively recently,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   in a discussion with the lady herself.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   One of the leaders in this whole movement is Lady Wooten.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   She used to be Barbara Wooten of Abinger.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And we were in a meeting and we had a somewhat heated discussion, I'm sorry to say, on this very matter.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Because I was using this term "natural" and "normal" and describing the characteristics of the permissive society as being abnormal and unnatural.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And she, as she has done many times in public and in print, that's why I'm quoting this, I wouldn't dream of quoting it otherwise,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   she said, but she said, "You have no right to talk about the natural. You have no right to talk about the normal."
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   She said, "Here are these people. You say that they are perverts, that what they do is contrary to nature."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   But she said, "The fact is this. It is natural to them. You say it's unnatural, but to them it is natural.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Therefore you have no right to condemn them."
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Now this is a very common argument at the present time.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And to me this is a very serious matter.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   If we don't recognize such a thing as normal or natural, well then there are going to be terrible consequences.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Now let me make this clear. When I talk about normal or natural, I'm obviously using a broad category.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And the illustration that I used to her on that occasion I will use now.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I use it in this sense.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Now, when I was a medical student and afterwards, we were given our cases and we'd examine them.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And then when the great chief came round, we used to have to read out our notes.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   We'd read about this man and his age and his family and his family history.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And then we'd take his own personal history and then we'd examine him and we'd put all this down in our notes and we'd read it out.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And we'd go through the various parts of the body and we'd say we'd examine the heart.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And if we couldn't find anything wrong, we'd say heart, natural. Nill abnormal.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And what did that mean?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Well, obviously no two hearts are identical.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Any more than two flowers are identical.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But on the whole, they are.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And it's the same with the heart.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Nill abnormal.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   The heart, normal or natural.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It doesn't mean that you've got this identity down to the smallest details and minutiae.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   But that it comes within a general category of what is normal or natural.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And that's the sense in which I am using the term here.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   There are certain broad divisions and classifications in nature.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Everywhere in nature you've got male and female with their distinct and definite and separate characteristics and functions.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And my contention is that so much of what's being not only talked about but justified today and gloated in and gloried in is contrary to nature.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And it is abnormal.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Well, very well, so we've got to meet this argument.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And it's because of this position which is taken up and its seriousness that I think we're doing a very good thing tonight in meeting together to consider this.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Why is it serious?
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Is it only a matter for preachers or philosophers or psychologists or sociologists?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Or is it something that affects us all and should be a concern to us all?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Well, I suggest that it is important for all of us for this reason.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   That this mentality and this outlook and this attitude can't be confined to any one realm.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Man is a whole.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And if you affect any one part of him in a very vital way, you'll find it'll affect the whole of him.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And people seem to think, you see, that you can have permissiveness in the realm of morals, but it won't make any difference to a man in his profession or in his business or in his work.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I suggest that that's a great fallacy.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And that if you allow this attitude to come in, which is based upon the unnatural and the abnormal, and indeed I would say that there is a definite anti-law and anti-discipline spirit as a vital part of it,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   this will lead to a general spirit of indiscipline and indeed to lawlessness.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And I think we're witnessing that at the present time, and we shall witness more and more of it.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   You lay down as a postulate in any one big department of life, I'm entitled to do what I think and what I like.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   You'll soon be doing that in every department of your life.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So that it leads to a general spirit of lawlessness and of indiscipline.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Now this is something which has very bad consequences.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It has very bad consequences for the individual himself.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   There is no question about this.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I could speak out of my experience, both as a medical man and as a preacher and pastor in a church.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I have experience going back by now over 50 years.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And I've had to see young men and young women who've been in great trouble owing to this kind of thing.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Mental confusion, unhappiness, condemnation of conscience, and various other things.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And in more recent times, some of them taking to drugs, some have become alcoholics, and so on.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It started in this realm, but it has spread.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   It seems to be the rule that if we break the laws, we have to pay for it.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And we pay for it partly in this personal unhappiness, personal confusion, personal trouble.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Now I don't want to be unfair in anything that I say.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   But one cannot but notice that this gentleman who recently has gained a good deal of notoriety over this film that he's produced,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   which is to be shown to school children, is a man who is now involved in his second divorce.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And he was questioned, some of you may have heard him being questioned the other afternoon on a program on the radio about this.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   "Did he think," asked the questioner, "that he was the man to be producing this film and talking about these things?"
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   While his own marriage life didn't seem to have been very successful.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   To which he gave what I thought was a totally inadequate reply, which was passed by the questioner.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   His reply was, "Well, perhaps it was because of these experiences, these unfortunate and unhappy experiences, that he perhaps knew more about this than anybody else."
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Well, you see the fallacy. The fact that a man is a failure is not the first desideratum in appointing him as a lecturer to deal with this thing, I would have thought.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   He's a man who needs help. He's not the man to tell us what to do.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   He obviously is a failure, and he needs help and instruction.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And yet he sets himself up as the authority, who's going to tell us all what to do, and even our children.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Now, in other words, he is an individual who is in a state of confusion himself.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And I solemnly suggest to you that if you examine so many of these good people, that you'll find something similar.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   I never forget an experience I had some three years ago.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   I was going somewhere to keep an appointment, and I had to change trains at Crewe.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   But to my dismay, I found that the connection that I should have caught, which should have taken me to my destination, had left.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Our train had broken down. Something had gone wrong at Stafford.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   So that by when we got to Crewe, they'd sent on the other train, and I had to spend about an hour and a quarter on the platform at Crewe.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And a very distinguished man, who very much belongs to the leaders of this permissive society, was in the same predicament.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I recognized him. He didn't know me. But I watched him.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And to my great interest, I found that this man walked up and down the platform talking to himself.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   And he'd go and look at a timetable on the wall, and he'd look it up and down.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   I don't know. He did this about at least half a dozen times, and he'd mutter to himself.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And then he went down and was a chain smoker in addition, and kept on talking to himself.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Well, I thought, "Here's the man who teaches us our morals and how to live."
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   I'm not surprised so much now at his views since I've seen his conduct and his behavior.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I think that man was in trouble.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Now, I think this is true of so many of them. I'm not libeling them.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   But I suggest that when you've got an abnormal view like this, there is some background, and you'll generally find it.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It's an interesting psychological study. I don't want to make too much of that tonight.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   However, my point is that it leads to consequences in the individual.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And, of course, it leads to still greater consequences in the family.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Now, I'm one of those who believes that the basis of the life of any civilization or country is the family, the family unit.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   It is the most important unit in any life of society.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   I'm told that whereas at the beginning of the Communist Revolution in Russia,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   they discouraged family life and have done so since in their communes in China,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   they've had to reverse this because of the effects it has had upon the life of the whole community.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   You'll never have a stable community unless you have a stable family life.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Well, now, permissiveness militates against that completely.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Obviously, it must do so.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It'll create difficulties between husband and wife.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And it's obviously creating grave difficulties between parents and children.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   This permissive spirit is an anti-law spirit, an anti-discipline spirit.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And the children are rebelling against their parents.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And we are reading about this, and we are aware of it.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I find that there are some tragic instances of this.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   In this country at the present time, it's my privilege to be traveling these days a great deal.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And I stay with people, and very nice people, and very good people.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And sometimes they tell me about their terrible problems.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Their children have got under this kind of influence, and it's wrecking the home and leading to very great unhappiness.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Well, you've read about this probably recently.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   A booklet has been issued under the auspices of the National Council for Civil Liberties.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And in this, certain claims were made, particularly for young people.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   It said that parents should have no control over their children in the matter of which school they should go to,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   or what friends they should make, or what they did as regards sexual experience in adolescence, and things like that.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And as you know, it's manifested itself in this kind of form,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   that students now claim that they have the right to determine the curriculum which they study.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   They have a right to appoint their professors and their teachers.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Now, this is sheer lawlessness.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   You can't describe it in any other way.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   They're not in a position to do this.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   They're in a position where they need instruction and help.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's not insulting. This is natural.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   The older always has to help and train and protect the younger.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   But you see, there's a general spirit of rebellion.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   There's no question at all that what ultimately accounted for the decline and fall of the great Roman Empire
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   was nothing but this very permissiveness with which we are concerned today.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You know, great empires, they get to a stage when people seem to have reached the pinnacle,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   and they get tired and weary.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   And they say, "We've been striving and we've become successful.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   We want a bit of enjoyment now. We want to rest ourselves."
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   And this is what happened in Rome.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Rome would never have been defeated by the Goths and the Vandals,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   merely in terms of the might and the prowess and the ability of these enemies.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   But what caused the fall of Rome was internal rot.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   These people began spending most of their time in their baths.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And these became more and more ornate and more and more elaborate.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   And the cultivation of the body and the cultivation of the natural instincts.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   In fact, it was immorality.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   A rottenness came inside.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   And this led to a general corruption.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And that in turn led, of course, to political corruption.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And eventually to a kind of military corruption.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And so Goths and Vandals are able to sack Rome and conquer this mighty military empire.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   In other words, because men is a unit and a unity, and because the whole of society is,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   you allow this element to come in, as I said, at any one point, it will permeate the whole life.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And so the whole of your society and the whole of your activity is bound to suffer.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   So to me, the problem of permissiveness is not merely a moral problem.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   It becomes a political problem. It becomes an industrial problem.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   See, people's minds are not on their work, they're on these other things.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And they live for them and these absorb their minds.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And work becomes a nuisance, just a means of getting money that you may indulge yourself in various ways.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And so the whole of your country and the whole of your society is going to suffer.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Well, very well. There is the condition.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   But what we are meant to consider is this. What can be done about it?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Is there any answer to this?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   It's all right to diagnose.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   But we should be concerned about treatment.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And is there any treatment?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Well, how do we face this?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   This is the thing that we are reading articles about constantly.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   We are hearing discussions about it on the television and the radio.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   But is there any answer? How do we approach this?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Well, I want to suggest an approach like this.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   The first thing that I would say is this.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   That there's nothing new about this in an ultimate sense.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   It's new for us.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's new for the oldest person who is in this meeting tonight.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   But if you look at world history, it's not new.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   It's happened many times before.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And therefore it seems to me we immediately have a line.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   If we are wise, we will learn from the past.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Now, I know that the modern attitude doesn't like that.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   The essence of the modern attitude is to dismiss the past.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   And this is a part of its arrogance.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And this is a part of its weakness.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It's not interested in the past.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   The past has been entirely wrong.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And they want something absolutely new.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Now, this I think is going to become a great issue in this country, as it's already become in America.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   There is that teacher, that philosopher on the west coast of America,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Herbert Marques, as people call him, I believe he likes to be called Marquesa,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   who has been a leader in all this.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   And has had a tremendous influence on students.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And he has his followers in every country.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And most of the student unrest and the student rebellion in the various countries
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   can be traced ultimately back to this man's teaching.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Now, what he does is, you see, to say that you've got to smash into the present society.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   You've got to do away with it.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And of course, he can produce some very plausible arguments.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   There's a lot of hypocrisy in society.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And no one should try to defend it.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   There are many things that have been wrong, but they don't stop at this.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Nothing has been right.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   It's all got to be changed.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And if you say to them, well, if you do that, your country will collapse in an industrial sense,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   they say, what's the matter?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   So what?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   We must make a completely fresh start.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And we must be allowed to live in the way in which we want to live.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   In other words, they're out for destruction.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   But if you ask them what they have to put in its place, they've got nothing.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   They've no positive views.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   All they know is the things that they are are hopeless.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   They're all wrong.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   We and our forefathers have all been blind.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And we have produced this present mess.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   We are responsible for wars.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And the only way to get rid of war and all this is to smash this whole view of life and of society completely.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   But they have no scheme.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   They have nothing to replace it with.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   It is entirely negative and entirely destructive.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And the most serious aspect of it is that it refuses to learn from the past.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And this, of course, is the whole tragedy of the human race.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   As that great German philosopher Hegel put it so perfectly in that well-known phrase of his,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   when he said, "History teaches us that history teaches us nothing."
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   What he meant by that was this, that we are so dull and stupid that we will not learn from history.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   The lessons of history are very plain and clear.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   But man in his folly won't listen to the lessons.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   He always thinks he knows better.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   So I am suggesting that the essence of wisdom is to look at the past.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   And you'll find that there have been periods of permissiveness before.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   When have these things happened before?
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Well, here are some of them. I'm only picking out some of the more notorious ones.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Take the period of the Regency.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   You remember when George III had some of his bouts of insanity, and particularly some of the longer bouts.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   And his son afterwards, George IV, became Prince Regent.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And he was a man who had permissive ideas.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And he introduced them, and they were taken up.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   And the life of the Regency was notorious.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   They didn't go, perhaps, to all the extremes to which they go now.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Let me say this even for the Regency people.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   They were more sinners than perverts.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But there was a great element of permissiveness.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Well, there's one period for you.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Another one, of course, is the period of the restoration of Charles II in 1660.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Where again, you had a man who was essentially permissive in his outlook.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And he introduced his ideas concerning life into the court.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And it spread throughout society.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   There is no doubt at all that the life in the period of the early part of the 18th century in this country
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   was almost as bad, if not as bad, as today.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I would still argue myself, personally, that there was this slight difference.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   That they were more sinners than perverts.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   But the sin was appalling.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Gin drinking was rampant.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Almost every other house in London was a place where you could buy gin.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Morality had reached one of its lowest ebbs and depths in this country at the beginning of the 18th century.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You can read about this. There are many books on it.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   One of the best, I always think, is a book called "England Before and After Wesley".
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And there you will find a description of what life was in this country in the first 35 years or so of that 18th century.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Well, you see, similar things.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   So we mustn't begin to think that there has never been a problem like this before.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   There has. And there are two notorious ones without going any further.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   But if you go still further back, you will find that way back, just before the first century AD,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   things were then almost identical with what they are tonight.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Now I'm going to prove this to you by reading to you a portion out of the Bible.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   See, we think we're so modern.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   We think there's never been anybody like us before.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   But there has. People were very similar to us just before Christ came into this world.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Would you like to know how they lived at that time?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Well, here's a description given by the Apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I'm reading a portion out of the first chapter.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And I don't apologize for reading this.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I've known people who've said that a passage like this should never be read in public,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   especially in a mixed congregation.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   But surely nobody living in the permissive society should say that.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I'm reading it just to show you how there's nothing essentially new about what we are confronting.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Paul says, "The invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   being understood by the things that are made, even as eternal power and courage,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   so that they are without excuse.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankful,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   This is very contemporary, isn't it?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   These are the wise people who are telling us how to live,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   telling us to break all laws and to do what we feel like doing, what's natural for us.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   How did they show it? Listen.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   "They changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible men
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things."
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   In other words, they gave up believing in God and they made idols for themselves.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Some of their idols they carved in human form, some in the form of birds and of beasts.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   In other words, they stopped worshipping God and they began worshipping things that they'd made themselves.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   This is what's happening today.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   People don't make idols, but they worship motor cars now instead, or their homes, or various other things like that.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The same thing precisely, the form changes, but the thing is there.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   And we're told, "God therefore also gave them up to uncleanness,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves."
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   These people who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped the creature more than the creator,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   who is blessed forever for this cause God gave them up, and to vile affections or lusts.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Now listen, "For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   to do those things which are not convenient."
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   This is how they lived, being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   If you can give me a more perfect description of life today than that, I'd be interested to hear it.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   That's an exact description of this permissive society, and it was written in the first century.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   See, there's nothing new about this. It's only new to us.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   There have been periods of this. There's a kind of periodicity in all this,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and nowhere is this shown more plainly than in the Bible.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   You notice the terms, the lawlessness, the arrogance, disobedience to parents, the perversions.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   And it's all because they thought they were wise.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   They turned their backs on God. They could do it all.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Well, here it is. So we can learn from the past.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Well, very well. It's all happened before.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   But then those periods have gone, and they've been followed by periods which were not characterized by permissiveness.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Better periods, nobler periods. How has it happened?
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And here, to me, is the thing we need to concentrate on at the present time.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   How have they dealt with these terrible periods of permissiveness in past ages?
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Well, it all comes back, I think, to this.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   The first question we've got to ask is this. What is man?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   What is a man? That's what it comes back to.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   For those who believe in permissiveness, regard men as an animal.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   They say that perhaps his cerebrum has developed in certain parts a little bit more than the other animals,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   but in men, he's an animal. They don't believe in a soul.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   They don't believe in the supernatural. They don't believe in God.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Man is an animal that has evolved.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   And what is he meant for in this world?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Well, he's obviously as an animal, here to eat and drink and to indulge in sex.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   He's to live the life of an animal. That's their view of men.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And of course, they're perfectly consistent with themselves.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   If man is just an animal like that, well then, I'm not surprised that he's behaving as he does.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   The animal obeys his instinct, his desire, his lust. He wants a thing and he goes after it.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   And if man is only an animal, well, I'm not surprised that if a man looks at another man's wife and fancies her, he goes after her.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Why shouldn't he? The animal does it. Why shouldn't man do it?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   And so on, with all these other matters.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   The matter mustn't talk about perversion, they say. It's only natural.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   It's only natural for him, as what he wants, who are you, to say and to impose your moral codes and rigidities upon him.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   See, it all comes back eventually to that.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   It isn't merely men's conduct. The question that arises is, what is a man?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   What's your view of men?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   And if I had no other reason for rejecting these permissive ideas, I would do so.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Because of my belief in men.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   In Shakespeare, and I don't think Shakespeare was much of a Christian, Shakespeare would have denounced this modern view of men.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   You remember how he describes men?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   He says, "What a piece of work is men!
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   How noble in reason!
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   How infinite in faculty!
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   In form and moving, how express and admirable!
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   In action, how like an angel!
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   In apprehension, how like a god!"
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   That's Shakespeare's view of men.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Not an animal, living in a farmyard, obeying his lusts and passions.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   The nobility, the greatness.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   In apprehension, how like an angel!
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   In action, how like an angel!
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   In apprehension, how like a god!
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Is that the creature who spends his weekends working out football pools and despising people who go to chapel or to church?
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You see, this modern view of men is an insult to human nature.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   It's altogether wrong, even on a standard such as that of Shakespeare.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   But this is the essence of the trouble.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   And the only true view of men is the view that's given of him in this book which we call the Bible.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Man is not merely an animal that's evolved some way or another.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   The Bible says that man is unique in the universe.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   He's been created in the image and likeness of God.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   He's been given certain qualities that no animal possesses.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   He can assess himself, he can judge himself, he can evaluate himself, he can reprimand himself, he can look on himself objectively.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   He's capable of reason.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Now man has got a body.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Man is an animal in that sense.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   He's got a body like the animals have bodies.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   What's the difference between a man and an animal?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Well, it should be this.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   The animal is governed by his impulses and instincts and desires.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   And there's nothing wrong in that.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   What about man?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   He's got the impulses and the desires.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   There's nothing wrong in that.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   The instinct for food, for drink, the gregarious instinct that brings us together, sex instinct.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   There's nothing wrong in this.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   The Bible has never said that there's anything wrong in sex.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Nothing at all.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   It's a part of God's gift to man.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   What's the difference between a man and an animal?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Well, it's this.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   That whereas the animal is governed by the impulses and desires, man is meant to govern them.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Man is meant to see them truly as the capacity for seeing the part they should play in his life.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   He's not dominated by them.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   He can discipline them and keep them within control.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   And they become a part of a greater whole and thus they develop a beauty that the animal is quite incapable of appreciating.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Now that's the biblical view of man.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   This extraordinary quality of reason and of judgment, of discipline and of self-control,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   because he is God's representative in this universe.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Now that's the biblical view of man.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Well then you may say to me, if that is true about man, why is the world as it is?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Well, the passage I read to you from Paul's epistle to the Romans has already given us the answer.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Though man began like this, he became wise in his own conceit, as he thinks he is today.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   The modern man dismisses the whole of the past.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   He alone knows.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Man said that at the beginning, man defied God.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   He rebelled against Him and so he fell.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And God, to bring him to his senses, permits him to reap some of the consequences of his own folly and of his own arrogance and rebellion.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   And the result is, because man defies God and sets himself up as an authority,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   he becomes a slave to his own lusts and his own passions and his own desires.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   He becomes a victim of his baser self.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   He turns what is good naturally into something that becomes wrong and evil.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And especially today, when he pulls out sex and puts it up on a pedestal and is worshipping it.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   That's why your newspapers are full of sex.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   The popular papers.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   And you get it shouting at you on the television and everywhere else.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Sex is made an idol.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   It's a part of man.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   But it's no longer a part.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   It's made the big thing and the main thing and it's dominating the whole of life we are living in a sex-ridden generation.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   But more seriously, man is showing that he is not capable of deciding for himself.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   He's lost his balance.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   He's lost his judgment.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   He's lost his sense of values.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Man, as the result of his rebellion against God, is too small to decide life for himself.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   He needs to be controlled.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   And the biblical teaching is that it is God who appointed kings and governors and magistrates, not men.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   It's God who led men and taught men to do this.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   What for? Well, to keep evil and sin within bounds.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Because men are no longer capable of doing this.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Now, doesn't the life of today prove this?
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   You see, this spirit of lawlessness and rebellion.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   People are no longer honoring contracts.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   They'll break their word.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   What for? Get more money.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Well, that's only one form of lust.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   Nothing is regarded as sacred.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Everything is broken.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   If I can get more out of it.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Men are living according to lust and to desire, not according to reason.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   They don't consider ultimate consequences.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   It's the immediate benefit, the immediate gain.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Man has become self-centered and selfish.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Every man's out for himself.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   I don't care what strata of society he belongs to.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   It's true of every one of them.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   The trouble industrially today is not confined to one section of society.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   It's running through them all.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   There's selfishness on every side.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Because man, out of a true relationship to God, is selfish and self-centered.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   He's a creature of lust and of desire.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   And he's governed by this.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   He may be moral in a general sense, but his real motives.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Contracts out of life.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   He's got his own family, his own home.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   He lives for himself.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   No responsibility for others.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   A self-contained life.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   This is sheer selfishness and self-centeredness.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Well, very well.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   This is the diagnosis of the situation.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   What can be done about it?
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   And I mustn't go on.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   But you see, you've given me such a big subject.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   I ought to go on till midnight or come many more times.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   But I'm going to stop.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   There are two things, two things it seems to me,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   that urgently call for action.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   What are we to do about this?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Well, first and foremost,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   we who still believe in law and order and discipline
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   must begin to assert ourselves.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   I believe that the majority of the people in this country
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   still believe in discipline and law and order.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   But we are silent.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   It's the rebels who are vocal.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   And I think the time has come
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   when people who believe in morality in the most general sense
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   and discipline and order
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   should begin to speak and to assert themselves
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   and to control what is taking place.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   At this point, I find myself completely in disagreement
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   with what Mr. Morton was saying in an interview the other day.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   He was being pressed, you see, to would he introduce legislation
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   to deal with pornography and various other aspects of this permissive society.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   And he took the line that no, he didn't want to do this.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   He said nothing is of any value unless it's voluntary.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Now, that to me is to deny really the rule of law.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Because if my view of men is correct,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   men will never voluntarily want to do what is right.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   He will do what suits him, what is selfish.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   So you've got to control men.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Men needs to be controlled.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Now, there are evidences of this all around.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   You have to send your children to school.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   There are various other laws which tell you what to do
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   and we submit to them.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   This question of pollution that's coming up now,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   people are getting excited about this.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Say something must be done.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   People must be stopped from polluting the land and so on.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   But when you tell them that they must be stopped polluting the minds
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and the morals of their children, they don't seem to be so keen on it.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Men needs to be controlled everywhere.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   We all need control.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   We've all benefited from discipline.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   And unless we can look back and be grateful for discipline,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   there's something wrong with us.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   So I say there's a great call for us to do this.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   And it may involve acts of Parliament.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Now, had there been time,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   I would have gone into the whole business of what the Puritans did
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   in the middle of the 17th century,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   remember, in the time of Oliver Cromwell.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   They got into control then.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   And they passed many acts of Parliament which are still on the statute book
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   about Sabbath observance and about sports on Sunday
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   and various things like that.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   I personally think the Puritans went too far.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   I think they almost persuaded themselves
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   that you could make a man a Christian by an act of Parliament.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   It can't be done.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   To that extent, I'm with Mr. Maudling,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   that you've got to try and get people to do this voluntarily.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   But if they won't,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   well, then I would say compel them to do so.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Prevent them from harming themselves
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   and from harming others
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   and perhaps from ruining the country.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   Discipline has to be imposed upon us
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   because as the result of our sinful state,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   we cannot discipline ourselves.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   We are governed by instincts and desires
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   that are stronger than us and stronger than our wills.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   That's as far as law can go.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   But I'm speaking as a Christian tonight.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   And thank God I can do so.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Because when law has done its utmost
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   and has failed,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   there is something else that comes in
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   which can succeed.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   And that is the Christian message.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   What is the message of Christianity?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   It is this.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   It starts by telling us
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   that God is over all
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   and that he's made the universe, man included,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   and that he has put certain laws into the universe and into us.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   And the universe and men can only function harmoniously
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   while it and he are obedient to the laws
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   that God has put within us.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Very well, but man has rebelled and has broken out of all this
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   and he's got himself into trouble.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Above all, he has offended God
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   and God is displeased with him.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   And the apostle Paul in that passage that I read to you
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   tells us that the wrath of God
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   is upon the ungodliness and the unrighteousness of man.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   And my friends, I don't hesitate to assert this tonight.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   People say sometimes, "How can you believe in a God?"
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   And look at what's happened in this century.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Look at the two world wars we've had.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   And you still believe in a God of love.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   I do.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   But I can tell you the explanation.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Paul says here that when mankind in its arrogance
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   not only turns its back on him,
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   but refuses to listen to him
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   and the teaching that he has sent into the world through his son,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   God abandons them.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   As if God says, "Very well, you say you can live without me?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   Go on living without me."
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   And for a hundred years and more now,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   mankind in its cleverness and in its belief in science and so on
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   says, "We don't need a God.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Man can make a perfect world."
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   "Very well," says God, "get on with it.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Make it."
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   And what's happened?
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Two world wars.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   And Buchenwald.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   And other horrors like those concentration camps.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   The things that have been happening recently in Vietnam.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   The horror of the immorality and the perversion
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   in the life of the leading civilized nations of the world today.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   That's what man does when God abandons him to himself.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   But I believe that God does this in love
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   in order to make man see what a fool he is.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Thinking themselves to be wise, they became fools.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   And then when they get into trouble,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   they turn back to God.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   And God in his love meets them.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   And he says, "In spite of what you've done,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   I haven't abandoned you."
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   And the great message of the gospel comes in
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   concerning Jesus Christ.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Who was he?
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   He's the eternal Son of God.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   He's not a man amongst men.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   He has come into the world out of eternity.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Born of the Virgin's womb.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Took on him human nature.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Lived a perfect life.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Shows us what can be done even in this world of sin and shame.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   But above all, that his death upon the cross
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   was a death for us.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   That he died for us.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   He took our guilt upon him.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   He reconciles us to God.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   And he who believes in Jesus Christ
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   gets an assurance that his sins are forgiven.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   But he doesn't stop at this.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   And this is what people often fail to understand.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   They think of Christianity as just a bit of morality and good living.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Do you know the essential message of Christianity is this?
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Not merely the forgiveness that comes through the cross,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   but new life.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   That a man, to use the biblical term, can be born again.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   What Jesus Christ said to a great man called Nicodemus.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   This to me is the one hope for the world at this moment.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   That a man can receive a new nature.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   He can literally have a new start in life.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   People say this is impossible.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   It isn't impossible.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   This is a miracle.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   And this is the essence of the message of the Christian faith.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   A man, however hopeless he may be,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   he may be a drug addict, a hopeless alcoholic,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   I don't care what he is.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   He can become an entirely new being.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   A new creature.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   A saint.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   He can hate the things he loved.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   And begin to love the things he hated.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   And he can start living a new life.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   And it's a life of joy.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   It's a life of peace.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   And he's given power to control his instincts and lusts and desires.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   And preventing them from becoming inordinate and controlling.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   They fall into their right,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   and into their rightful place in his life.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   His life becomes a whole and harmonious.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   And he feels that he is really beginning to live
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   for the first time in his life.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   The law can only go so far.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   But when it fails,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   this message, which as Paul describes it,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   is the power of God
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   unto salvation
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   to everyone that believeth can do it.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   Now, this is what it does.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   This isn't theory.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   History proves that this is a fact.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   By reading you one other bit of scripture.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   The Apostle Paul had visited a city called Corinth in Greece.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   And it was a cosmopolitan seaport town.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   It had its universities also.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   But it was living a life that was nothing but a sink of iniquity.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   And Paul went there and preached.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   And people believed the message and they joined the church.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   He formed a church there.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   And writing to them later, he puts it like this.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   "Be not deceived."
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Well, let me start before that.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   "Know ye not that the unrighteous
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Be not deceived.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   nor revilers, nor extortioners,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   shall inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   Listen.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   "And such were some of you.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   But you have been justified.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   You have been washed.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   You have been sanctified.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   You have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   Do you see the significance of this?
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   What Greek philosophy in its prime had failed to do,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   the Apostle Paul's preaching of the gospel,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   had succeeded in doing.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   This was a time, remember,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   when Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle had been
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   and had founded their schools.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   This brilliant nation of Greece
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   was living that kind of life.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   And philosophy couldn't help it.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   But Paul went and preached this simple gospel,
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   telling them that he determined not to know anything among them
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   And these people who had been living in that sink of iniquity
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   had been taken out.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   They'd been washed.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   They'd been completely changed.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   And they were now saints adorning the Church of God.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   I could keep you for hours in telling you the stories
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   of the great revivals of religion
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   in the history of this, our own nation.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   How in the 18th century,
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   which had started in such an appalling manner,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   was changed completely by the preaching
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   of Whitefield and the Westleys and others.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   A great evangelical awakening.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   And so you had the Victorian era.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Say what you like against it.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   It was a moral period.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   And it wasn't disgraced by the foul perversions
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   in which people are glorying in today.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   That hadn't been the case.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   Because God still is.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   It can happen also today.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Well, I think we've had the answer given us.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   But I did say, and Dr. Lloyd-Jones is willing to answer
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   any questions that anyone might have.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   So please stand up and ask the question
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   so that we might be able to hear it.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   Dr. Lloyd-Jones will endeavour to answer your question, please.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   I feel just to say this,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   that through the very scripture that was uttered tonight
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   in that church where Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones ministered,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   though he wasn't ministering on the night that I heard the message,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   like many sitting here tonight,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   I'm sure my background was very similar,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   but I heard for the first time in my life this truth.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   "Except ye be born again, you will not see,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   you will not enter the kingdom of God."
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   And I feel that the message lies with us tonight,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   that we do need individually this new life in Christ.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   I'm going to close this meeting in prayer.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   I'm sure that though Dr. Lloyd-Jones will be going on,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   if anybody wishes to speak to him privately,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   he'll be only too pleased to do so.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   But let us be honest, men and women tonight,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   we have heard God speak to us.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   How easy it is to say that this is a message for somebody else,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   rather than for ourselves.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   "Except ye be born again, you will not see the kingdom of God."
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   Let us pray.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   We thank Thee, Heaven and Father, for enabling Thy servant tonight
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   to give us an intelligent and honest and comprehensive appraisal
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   not only of our history, but of the history of this nation
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   and of this world over many centuries.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   And yet, Lord God, we pray that we may have heard Thee speak to each one of us.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   Lord God Almighty, as Thou has visited this nation
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   and Thy church in this nation before,
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   wilt Thou not revive us again?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   And yet, Lord God, may we examine our hearts
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   before we leave our seats tonight and ask ourselves,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   have we been born of God?
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   Has the Spirit of the living God imparted new life and new hope to us
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   and the forgiveness of our sins through the cross of Christ?
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Lord, we pray, have Thy way in us and through us
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   that returning to our homes, our business, our school, our university,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   we may make a contribution to the overcoming of evil
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   with good, with Thy power and with Thy life in us.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   Part us this night, we pray, under Thy blessing, Lord.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   And we pray that lasting good may even come to this village and neighborhood
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   through our gathering tonight because we ask it
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   in the name of our beloved Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
