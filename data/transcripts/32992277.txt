[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.120]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.880]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.680]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.040]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.640]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.680]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.340]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.320]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.880]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.560]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.380]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.960]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.960]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.480]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.780]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.080]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to talk to you today
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.400]   about talking to you today.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.240]   Actually, we're going to have, I hope,
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240]   and I believe a great conversation
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.960]   with one of my friends, Daniel Shirley,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.960]   who also serves as the CC+ Program Director.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.240]   I'm gonna let Daniel tell you what that is
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.400]   in just a second in case you don't already know
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.520]   what all those letters and titles mean.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   But today, we really want to explore the idea
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.260]   of good conversation.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.380]   What makes for a good conversation
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.140]   and how can we learn to have good conversations
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.820]   and to participate in good conversations?
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.460]   And also, as parents,
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.700]   what's our responsibility to our children
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.780]   to teach them the skills of good conversation?
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.020]   How can we as parents help them grow in that area?
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.800]   And y'all, I'm here to tell you
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.180]   that both children who like to talk
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.160]   and children who don't like to talk
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.340]   have something to learn about conversation.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.860]   So Daniel's gonna be exploring that with me.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.960]   Daniel, welcome.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.800]   - Thanks, Lisa.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.300]   Glad to be here again.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.420]   Definitely excited to have a conversation
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.900]   about conversation.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.060]   - I want you to tell people just really briefly
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.140]   what CC+ Program Director means
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.820]   just to give them a context for who you are
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.900]   and what you spend most of your time doing.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.140]   - Yeah, well, it's actually, it's kind of funny.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.560]   The topic of this podcast is pretty fitting
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.660]   because I've been mostly my job over the last month.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.660]   So the kind of heaviest registration season that we have
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.980]   for students enrolling in CC+
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.540]   has been a lot of conversations with families,
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.180]   helping them unpack what the experience of college
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.820]   looks like, how to utilize CC+
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.940]   to best kind of enhance their community experience
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.660]   rather than detract from it or subtract from it.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.500]   And yeah, so I mean, a lot of conversations
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.940]   with a lot of people.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.140]   - That's cool.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.880]   - Yeah, I think I was doing the math the other day
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.480]   'cause I thought it'd be fun to see the numbers.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.320]   - Yeah.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.900]   - But I'm pretty sure that it was something like
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.900]   410 conversations over the last month.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.720]   - My word.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.280]   - Lot of chatting with people, administrative stuff,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.120]   but really, I like to think of it like the administration
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.960]   doesn't matter as much if you don't have that kind of,
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.240]   that ability or that space to be open
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.560]   and have conversation with the families
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.160]   that are trying to participate in this program
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.200]   that we're running.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.440]   - Right, well, that conversation is what makes it human.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.280]   - Indeed.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.680]   - And that is what builds community.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.320]   Well, that's a lot of conversations to have in a month
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.840]   and that doesn't even include the conversations
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   you have at home.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.240]   So I appreciate you making time to have a conversation
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.760]   with me about this today.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.360]   I wanna ask you as we start out,
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   have you ever known somebody who was super easy to talk to?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.320]   Maybe you still know this person.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.120]   Super easy to talk to.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.120]   And then what made them or makes them easy to talk to?
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.880]   - Yeah, I think this is kind of one of those questions
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   that's really difficult to answer.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.360]   You could answer it in,
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.680]   there's so many different dimensions and dynamics
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.160]   and conversation is such an integral part of being a human.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.760]   Talking to other people is just fundamentally,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.800]   it's like one of the most human things.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.480]   Aristotle even says something like,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   the human being is something like a social animal,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.320]   which is all about talking.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.000]   I would say like, if I had to put it simply,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.680]   I would say that the people that I find it the easiest
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.360]   to talk to have this combination of confidence,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.920]   but also they're relaxed.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   They're not like on four shots of espresso
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.000]   or something like that.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.520]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.560]   - That kind of brings an intensity to it
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.000]   that maybe makes it not as easy,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.400]   but definitely has a lot of energy.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.080]   So some kind of relaxed confidence
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.080]   and like a genuineness in the sense that you can tell
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.240]   that they care about the answers
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.800]   and the questions that they're giving and receiving.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.560]   So yeah, I guess that would be it.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.440]   What about you?
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   What are the traits that you've noticed in people
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.480]   that you find easy to talk to?
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.320]   - You know what?
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.040]   I would mirror your answer.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.880]   I really liked that, you're right.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.280]   It is a mixture of confidence.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.160]   So people that are easy to talk to are not,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.600]   at least on the surface, super shy and bashful.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.320]   So they're not super retiring.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   They are willing to have an opinion or an idea and own it.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.480]   And they have an air of being an interesting person.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.680]   And at the same time, as you said,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.040]   being interested in the other person
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.440]   and the other person's idea.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.080]   I also agree with your comment
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.320]   that people who are super intense
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   are really kind of off-putting for me in conversation
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.480]   because it's almost like a combative role.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.840]   I always feel like with really intense people
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.360]   that I need to take a step back,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   or that I need to put my hand on the other person's shoulder
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.240]   so I don't get swallowed up.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   I want them to be interested,
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.040]   but I don't want to feel like a specimen under glass.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   And so I think one of the best conversationalists,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.400]   the most comforting and comfortable people to talk to
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.880]   in my past is a dear friend,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.120]   a lady who is so stinking busy.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.560]   She's always busy.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.440]   She has literally 10 children.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.600]   And when we were the closest,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.280]   all of our kids were pretty young.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.360]   But if you were talking to Rachel,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.080]   you always felt like you had her full attention.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   And you always felt like she was listening to what you said
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   because she was interested in you as a person.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.440]   She wanted to know what you thought about things.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.760]   And she wasn't overpowering or smothering,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.320]   but she was very interested.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   She made you feel like the most interesting person
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.280]   in her sphere at that moment.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.520]   And so that made her really easy to talk to
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.760]   'cause I thought she was really listening.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   - Yeah, and that is important.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.000]   I mean, I think that attention
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.280]   is one of the most on-demand assets
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.920]   that we have to offer one another as human beings.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.680]   And so to prioritize someone genuinely with your attention
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.320]   has to be a part of what it means
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   to be a good conversationalist,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.400]   to be good at talking to other people,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.360]   and to be easy to talk to.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.960]   They have to feel prioritized in your sphere of attention.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.600]   - Yes, yes.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.920]   But at the same time, I want us to think about it.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.440]   And we might decide that it is the same thing,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.000]   or maybe we'll just dance around this question.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.120]   Is being easy to talk to
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.400]   the same thing as being a good conversationalist?
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.640]   - It's, there's gotta be a relationship
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.520]   because they both involve talking.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.320]   - Yes.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.520]   - They're connected somehow.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.360]   And I would think like,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.440]   do you think it's a fair distinction
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.360]   between being easy to talk to versus a conversationalist?
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.640]   Is it the same thing?
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.800]   Do these play out in the mediums of like small talk
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.680]   versus something that we would classify as conversation?
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   - Wow, that's a really good point.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.920]   Because some people, you're right,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.640]   some people, I think where you're going
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.360]   is that some people are easy to make small talk with,
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   but maybe they're not as easy to have a quote, unquote,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   deep conversation with.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.800]   And there might be some differences there.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.640]   I think that people who are easy to talk to
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.640]   in a small talk way are people who are good
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.760]   at throwing the ball back and forth.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.600]   I had a friend, a church friend one time,
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.000]   she was so hard to get to know.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.280]   I told my husband once that it was like
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.440]   playing tennis with the wall.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.760]   I mean, that she never hit the ball back.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.640]   It just always dropped.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.840]   I would lob a conversational ball to her
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.160]   and she would just kind of,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.480]   if she answered, it wasn't throwing it back to me,
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.760]   it just kind of dropped.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.720]   And so there are people that are not easy
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.360]   to make conversation with because they don't play the game.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.600]   They don't, they're not interested back
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.360]   or they just give you a one word
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.800]   or even a monosyllable answer.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   So what is it that makes somebody a good,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:55.680]   deeper conversation or more than just chit chat?
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.560]   - Right, I feel like, well, one of the things
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.920]   that you're describing in that example of like,
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.400]   it's like a volley back and forth in the small talk.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.360]   In some ways, I've heard people say before
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.200]   that I'm not much for small talk.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.800]   Like give me the stuff that matters,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.640]   give me the substantial topics.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.880]   And those are the things that I enjoy.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   There's almost like this pattern of conversation
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.400]   that while the content of small talk
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.880]   is not maybe the most important thing,
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.720]   there's a reason that you don't immediately begin talking
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.080]   about the most important things.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.640]   Because it's like, those things are valuable to us.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.120]   We care about them, the most important things, let's say.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.720]   And we want to know that the person we're engaging
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   in conversation with is of the kind to reciprocate our care
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.880]   and our values, something like that.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   And so I think we test that in the realm of small talk
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.080]   all the time is we're picking up on hints and clues of,
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.120]   well, if I do share this deeper part of my soul
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.920]   or these deeper concerns that I'm interested
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.600]   in having conversation about, will it be respected?
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.360]   Will it be reciprocated?
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   Or is it going to be shunned or mocked or ignored
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.960]   or any of those other things?
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.720]   So I feel like the small talk components,
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.160]   it's related to being able to have a good conversation.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.840]   - Yes, it's like the opening salvo kind of.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.840]   - Yeah, and that's a reason why I think in other cultures,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   like I remember my wife was on a missions trip in Tanzania.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.480]   And one of the things she noticed about the way
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.080]   that people there would interact with each other
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.320]   is that their strings of greetings were so long.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.040]   Like they would go on, like just the greetings would go on
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.280]   for maybe like five to seven minutes
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.800]   before they would actually talk to each other.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.520]   And obviously being from outside the space,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.960]   it was like, "Oh, weird."
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.800]   'Cause like we don't do that.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.440]   - Right, we don't do that, mm-hm.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.160]   - And so thinking about it in this way though
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.200]   of trying to figure out if the other person
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.680]   is willing to play the game when it comes to topics
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.320]   that actually really matter.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.760]   And this is something we can learn
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.640]   via these kind of opening salvos or these greetings
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.400]   of which small talk, I think is definitely one.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.320]   - That is really good.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.120]   That's a good, good insight
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.200]   that we take the measure of one another
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.400]   as we engage in small talk.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.360]   And maybe in the course of small talk,
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.200]   we uncover common interests
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.600]   or common beliefs
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.560]   or common mannerisms even,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.320]   common understandings
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.480]   or similar likes or similar dislikes.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.760]   Yeah, that's really good.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.160]   And that a lot of times leads the way
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.920]   toward deeper conversations.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.600]   So what is it that,
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.080]   and I guess we'll just take ourselves
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.560]   'cause we can't really answer for the world at large,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.720]   I suppose.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.640]   What is it that draws you
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.960]   toward a deeper conversation with somebody?
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   What quality does somebody possess or exhibit
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.080]   that draws you into deeper conversation?
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.120]   - That's another, yeah, that's a good question.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.760]   What quality do they possess or exhibit?
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.320]   Well, I think like immediately
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.920]   something that comes to my mind
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.760]   is they have shown themselves
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.120]   over a period of time to be someone
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.640]   that's in the possession of wisdom
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.520]   or experience that I'm curious about and I don't have.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:13.440]   That draws me deeper into like a consideration of like,
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   oh, this is someone that I'm interested in talking to.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.760]   They have a, like there's a guy at my church, for example,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.720]   and he has lived a fascinating life.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.680]   He's got a boat in his garage
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.480]   and he's gonna try to do some kind of crazy endurance race
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.000]   around like the Panhandle of Florida
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.200]   or around the state of Florida in a sailboat.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.480]   - Oh my, okay.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.720]   - And I was just like,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.480]   I just haven't met anybody that's thinking that way.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   So I'm kind of curious, why, how are you doing this?
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.440]   What can, you know, obviously there's a tenacity
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.440]   and a discipline that is admirable inside this domain.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.000]   And so I've just been really fascinated
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.440]   to learn a little bit more.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   So that it's kind of, they possess a experience
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.800]   that is something that is beyond you to a certain extent
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.120]   or just at a different domain and then a consistency.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.440]   So you know that this isn't just kind of like a facade
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.240]   or a show, you've seen it repeatedly play out
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.440]   over a long period of time,
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.360]   whether that be a month or a year or two years.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.320]   And I feel like that deepens the appreciation,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.840]   the respect and the interest.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.000]   - That's really good.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   So we're drawn into conversations with people
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   that we admire or that have traits
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.400]   that we'd love to emulate,
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.480]   or even sometimes just traits that are so different
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.320]   from ours we want to know why,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.800]   and how did you get that way?
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.040]   And why is that good to you?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   So how do you see that?
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.000]   Like just in the run-of-the-mill conversation,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.360]   say you were going to a conference, Daniel,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.440]   and you were not gonna be with people
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.920]   that you had met before,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.520]   and potentially people that you'll never see again,
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.360]   how do you have a good conversation?
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.280]   What qualities of someone you just met
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.680]   would draw you into a conversation?
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.800]   - Yeah, again, I think it would be learning
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.840]   about their interest and their experience.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.360]   I feel like that's definitely something real.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.320]   I think in any kind of transitory space,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.200]   you have to release expectation
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.240]   for what a conversation is going to be.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.760]   And so you could be pleasantly surprised,
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.360]   but when I go to conferences
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.720]   and I'm going to a conference in about a month
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.360]   down in Georgia at Covenant College,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.680]   and anytime I kind of move into that space,
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.280]   I A, recognize that inside the space
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.360]   of like any kind of academic setting,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.200]   that you have to release any kind of ego or pride
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.320]   because everyone there is much smarter than you.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   And so you set that expectation very low of yourself.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.400]   And then you set the expectation
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.200]   of having good conversation to be,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.960]   it might happen, but we're just gonna meet people
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.960]   and fellowship and enjoy a good time.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.640]   It could lead to that.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.920]   But then again, I do think an element
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.960]   to foundationally and fundamentally good conversation
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.680]   is longevity of community.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.760]   So if you meet someone out and about,
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.560]   really, I think before you're having
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   really, really great conversations,
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.320]   there's a friendship, like there's a layer of communion
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.120]   that has to be established
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.240]   before the conversation can be its fullest.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   So, I don't know if that's a little bit off the rail.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.200]   - No, no, that's actually very excellent.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.120]   And Daniel, I think it's really encouraging
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.720]   because we're talking about how to have a good conversation,
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.240]   but we're talking and people that are listening
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.440]   are families and their parents who want to know
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.720]   how to have a good conversation with their little kids
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.240]   and their middle schoolers and their high schoolers
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.040]   and their college students and their grownup kids.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:31.000]   And what you just said is super encouraging for all of us,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.600]   what you said about longevity of community
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.840]   leading to the best conversations.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   So that's an encouragement because parents,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   nobody knows you like your children do,
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.200]   and that can be a double-edged sword.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.960]   As a parent, I'm here to tell you that's the truth.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.320]   But nobody knows your kids like you do.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   And so you guys are poised within your family
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.400]   to have some seriously great conversations.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:11.360]   And so the best kindling to build that fire
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.240]   is already there.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.640]   So what we're talking about and exploring today
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.240]   are ways to light that fire and ways to fan those flames
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.240]   and ways to avoid pouring cold water on those flames.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.340]   And so that's what I'm hoping, Daniel,
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.920]   that we can, as you and I just talked together,
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.040]   that we will bring those out
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.320]   or have them stumble upon them ourselves
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.820]   and be able to share them.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.760]   Let's just start, let's start right here.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.440]   What would you say goes into the making
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.620]   of a good conversation?
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.400]   What is a good conversation?
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   - Yeah, so a good conversation, let's see.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.480]   I think a good conversation begins
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.840]   with a good question and a good heart.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.280]   - Ooh, okay, I have to write that down.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.720]   Begins with a good question and a good heart.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.120]   You're gonna have to explain that 'cause I feel riches.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.200]   I feel riches are hidden in that sentence.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.400]   (both laughing)
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   - Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.360]   - We'll dig it up anyway and we'll see.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.840]   - Yeah, we'll see, we'll see.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.240]   Come back and examine afterwards.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.080]   - That's right.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.900]   - I think that what I mean by good,
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.900]   so I recently was reading back through Plato's "Republic"
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:45.120]   and trying to understand the quote unquote transcendentals
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.960]   in a way that Plato understood them
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   or kind of draw out from the text what it means to be good.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.560]   And you'll have to let me know
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.200]   if you think this is a decent definition of the good or--
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.480]   - Yeah, I'm interested to hear it, yep.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   - Yeah, so the good is when the pattern
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:12.080]   of intelligibility aligns with reality.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.640]   So what I mean by that is something like,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.640]   we have all sorts of ideas and hypotheses and questions
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.680]   that are rolling through our brains consistently.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.840]   And sometimes those overlap and they map onto the world
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.000]   in a way that actually allows us to move forward.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.120]   And actually it agrees, like the invisible of my mind
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.040]   agrees with the visible of the world.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.640]   - Yes, it matches what I'm seeing
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.000]   and what makes the world go forward
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and what affirms reality.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.240]   - Right, and so that's the good.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.760]   - Yes, okay, that resonates.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.120]   - That resonates, okay.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.080]   So that brings us to a good question,
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.680]   which is a question that actually harmonizes
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.160]   these visible and invisible aspects of reality.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.960]   So a question that's not flippant
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.360]   or that's not generated out of illusion,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.200]   something like that.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.560]   So a real question,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.400]   maybe it might be another way to say it as well,
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.720]   a good question, a real question.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.200]   And then the same thing with the heart,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   because we know that the heart can be turned
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.680]   in all sorts of different ways that are errant and not good.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   And so a heart that is aligned with
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.360]   or desires fundamentally the good,
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.240]   which is that we might harmonize the visible
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.280]   and the invisible more than they are already.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.600]   And so that combination of a good heart
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.280]   and a good question,
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.400]   I think those are two foundational components
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.840]   of a good conversation.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.440]   - Wow, that is a lot.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.680]   Okay, listeners, you may have to like stop and think
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.560]   and replay and think again,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.800]   but I believe that we'll all find something
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.120]   that will help us in our conversations from that, okay?
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.560]   Begins with a good question.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.720]   So not something super surface,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.240]   or as you said, not flippant.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   A good question that really seeks to make a connection
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.520]   between what we think and wonder
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.960]   and what we see and know to be right.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   And then the good heart that really desires the best,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.760]   that is looking for improvement or enlightenment.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.320]   And so that's the beginning of a great conversation
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.920]   because you throw out that good question.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.560]   And if you've got a good conversational partner,
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.760]   they will accept your invitation in the spirit
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.520]   in which it was given.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.200]   And you guys can chew on this question for a while.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.000]   And that would make a good conversation, I agree.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.920]   - Do you think I could go down the rabbit hole
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.800]   of what makes conversation within family difficult sometimes?
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.200]   I would love it 'cause my next question to you
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.560]   is going to be, that makes conversation good,
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.680]   what makes conversation awkward?
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.640]   So go down that hole, Daniel.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.000]   - Okay, particularly with the family.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   I think this is something that we fall into all the time
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.560]   and we're not aware of it
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.400]   because we're not paying attention maybe
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   to some really kind of obvious truths.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.280]   And so one of the things that's obvious about being human
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.040]   is that when we become familiar with things,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.560]   and there's a reason that familiar
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.960]   is connected to the word family.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.240]   To be something, to be familiar means it's like family.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:00.400]   We get into these patterns and habits of taking for granted
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.080]   the things that are familiar to us.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.480]   And so because I don't meet,
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.440]   let's say my wife for the first time
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.120]   when I wake up every morning,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.040]   there's a mercy there
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.360]   'cause I don't have to figure everything out new
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.800]   every single day. - Exactly, exactly.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   - However, I, as let's say in this case,
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.440]   if I'm aiming to have a good conversation
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.560]   with someone in my family,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.960]   I have to free them in some sense
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.480]   from the domain of the familiar.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.840]   I have to let them continue to be something
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.720]   like freedom and potential, something like that.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.920]   They have to be able to give me an answer
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.040]   that would surprise me.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.600]   Even if I know they're maybe not going to give me an answer
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.240]   that would surprise me,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.200]   I have to at least create that possibility
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.640]   and allow that to happen from in my own soul.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.760]   Otherwise I've restricted their potential
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.000]   to a certain level to where I will not be interested
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.360]   in what they have to say.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.400]   - Or maybe you're not able to receive what they say.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.000]   Like you can't even hear it
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.160]   because it doesn't fit your script.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.840]   - You don't have the ears to hear, right?
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.360]   I think this is really kind of when Christ is talking
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.760]   about eyes to see and ears to hear.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.640]   It's like, well, you've got the biological ears to hear,
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.480]   but it's like, no,
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.200]   there's actually a default mode of perception
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.480]   that can make it impossible for you to hear
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.760]   something new from someone that you're familiar with.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.640]   And so it's important to guard against that
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.120]   inside our families.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.560]   - That is so true.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   We absolutely have to let family members grow and change.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.920]   We have to offer them the freedom to grow and change.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.000]   And it's really, I will just confess, okay,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.200]   my girls, you know, Daniel,
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   my girls are grown, they're grownups and they have been.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   And so I know what it is to walk through the changing
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.960]   as those people, as those children were becoming the adults
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.600]   that the Lord put the seed in them to become.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:20.640]   As when that's happening in front of you day by day,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.760]   parents, I'm thinking I'm probably not the only one
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.200]   that had a hard time.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.840]   My girls were becoming who they were always meant to be,
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   but I didn't always welcome that process
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   or I didn't always see it and accept it as fast as it came.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.320]   And so I feel like I probably stunted
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   some of our conversations by not allowing them
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.520]   to put forth ideas that had never been them before.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.480]   And so I feel like probably, and some of that,
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.800]   I guess I didn't have ears to hear, as you said,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.240]   and some of that, I just was so used to the way
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.120]   that they had always answered that I just assumed
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.960]   that the answer they gave me was the answer I anticipated
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.240]   and didn't even hear the new material.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.120]   - Hmm.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.280]   - I think that's really, that's a good caution for us
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.360]   to keep it fresh in our families
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.440]   and to always be open to growing.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.440]   If we offer that open space to our kids,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.720]   they offer it to us too.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:50.800]   Because there are ways in which I feel like I've changed
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   and I've grown and I have deepened some understandings
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.680]   of the world and of human nature and of the Lord
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.440]   since my girls have grown up and left home.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   And sometimes in the conversations that we have,
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.520]   I don't feel them giving me the freedom
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.920]   to have become someone new.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.080]   And so it is a two-way street and we can all practice
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   that, what Daniel was saying, giving family members
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.520]   the freedom to grow and change.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.360]   That's really good, Daniel.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:37.800]   - I think it really, I was exploring some different
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.960]   kind of resources in preparation for this conversation
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.520]   and I found a lot of the things that I was reading
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.080]   around the topic of conversation,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   also they kind of inevitably converged
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.000]   into the space of education and what it looks like
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.680]   to educate. - Sure, sure.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   - And I feel like that's, it's one of the ways
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.760]   that we're always educating one another, right?
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.120]   It's just going back and forth inside the space
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.240]   of conversation.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.200]   It was a quote that was attributed, I think, to Longfellow,
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.760]   but I'm not sure it's really a Longfellow quote,
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.040]   but it was still-- - Right, yep.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.360]   - It was still a good one.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.360]   I read a stat today that said that the, what is it?
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.640]   57% of the internet's content now is AI generated.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.920]   - Oh my gosh. - And so it's,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.640]   you really can't tell anymore, but--
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.000]   - Yeah, you're right.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   - But I'd like this idea, at least,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.680]   which is something like a conversation with a wise man
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.480]   is worth more than reading for 10 years,
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.360]   something like that. - Oh, wow.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.760]   - And I think that this is just foundational
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.520]   to human experience and human learning
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.400]   is that seeking out those with wisdom
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.840]   and engaging them in conversation
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:04.800]   is a way to gather resources and carry on whatever tradition
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.720]   in a way that is not the same,
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.480]   it's not carried on in the same way
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.840]   through just filling our head with written material
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.960]   from paper books or, more likely,
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.320]   from the internet at this point.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.800]   - Oh, right.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.160]   - And so-- - That's a great point.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.520]   - That moment is, yeah, definitely important.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.440]   And then I ran across another quote attributed to Galileo
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.680]   that says, "You can't teach a man anything.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.600]   "You can only help him to find it within himself."
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.560]   And I feel like, again, in the familiar space,
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.000]   in the family space, this is something
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   that we have to remember,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.920]   especially with maybe partially grown children,
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.440]   is that there is, as we move further into maturity,
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.440]   the appropriateness of didactic instruction
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.280]   kind of instead of genuine conversation is less and less.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.360]   - Yes, that's absolutely.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.200]   That's absolutely true.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.960]   I think that, well, I'll tell you what I think
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   and then I want to know what you think.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   Why is conversation better than what you read in a book?
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:26.000]   I mean, I think it's because we learn from each other
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   in our learning compounds, and it goes like lightning.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.640]   So I learn, I tell you what I think,
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.280]   and then you tell me how what I said
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.240]   either resonates with you and why,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.200]   or why you have a difference.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   And then I learn from you, and then you learn from me,
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.480]   and together we go farther quicker
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.520]   in our understanding of the topic than we ever would have
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.760]   if we were just by ourselves
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.160]   taking in one thought at a time.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.520]   - Indeed, and I think one of the reasons that this is
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.160]   is because it's like, well, what are you reading a book for?
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:14.280]   Probably somehow in some way to deepen
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.160]   or improve the ethic of your life
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.960]   as it relates to other people, right?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.480]   Maybe it could just be for pure pleasure enjoyment
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.080]   if you're reading like, I don't know,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.640]   some kind of 25 volume mystery novel series.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.680]   - But it usually is gonna connect with something
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.880]   like the end of being able to have a conversation
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.360]   with someone about that text,
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.200]   or that it teaches you how to just act more sensibly
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.040]   in the world of other people.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.960]   And so there was actually a fascinating story
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.240]   that I was listening to the other day about,
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.680]   it was someone talking about the history of Ireland,
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.320]   and one of the things that he said
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.360]   is that with ancient peoples,
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.080]   they didn't write histories in relationships
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.680]   to like factual events.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.440]   Think about like Gibbon's "Rise and Fall of Rome,"
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.880]   something like that, and that's not the title.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.720]   That history is tied to a particular event,
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   but in the old world, they would tell stories about men,
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.800]   like about, you know, like human beings,
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.840]   and they would categorize their historical progress
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.000]   of the country of Ireland or something like that
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.120]   by the lives of different individuals,
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.960]   rather than tying it to particular,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.400]   like let's say monumental events.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.320]   It was about the embodiment in the person
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   as a marker of historical kind of significance.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.800]   So I feel like that's just,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.600]   we don't think about things quite that way anymore.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.720]   We don't prioritize maybe the human being
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.520]   as much as the ancients did.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.000]   We think that humans maybe are something more
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.680]   to be cynical about because we're prone to error
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.080]   rather than being, you know,
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   more apt to teach us than tomes and volumes.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.960]   - Yeah, I agree, I agree.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.720]   I enjoy learning from a person.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.120]   I enjoy learning, so I enjoy learning from books.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.720]   So I'm not saying that.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.880]   I enjoy learning from a person
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.160]   because it seems somehow more applicable
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.480]   to the life I am living,
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.320]   especially as I live in community with that person
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.720]   and with other people.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   And so it shapes our knowledge into ways
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.560]   that are very useful for building community
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.120]   and building a world, I like that.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.520]   So how do we teach the people in our families
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:12.200]   to have good conversations?
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   So think about, so for us who have little kids
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.600]   or little grandchildren,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   I have a grandson who's two years old, light of my life,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:29.320]   and he is learning how to have conversations.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.480]   At this point, his conversations are,
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.640]   they are just becoming him wanting to tell me
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.360]   what he has done and seen and thought about.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.240]   They have been mostly his bid for information.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.240]   And so I tend to tell him lots of things.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.800]   We walk around and we're talking about everything.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.120]   And so the other day we talked about,
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.440]   we were outside playing, we talked about sun and shade.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.200]   And so mostly it was me talking
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.880]   and moving my body to demonstrate and him listening.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.560]   And so, but all that day afterwards,
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   he every once in a while would say,
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.720]   "Talk about shade again."
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.720]   And so he wanted that conversation, right?
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.960]   He's gathering his information,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.120]   'cause I gave him some,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.520]   what do you see in the sun and the shade?
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.360]   And what do you feel?
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.280]   And so our little children,
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.440]   a lot of times their conversation seems like
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.560]   a bid for information, right?
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.160]   How, when do we teach our children,
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.120]   our little kids conversational skills?
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.240]   And how do we do this?
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.360]   You've been a little kid before.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.920]   Do you remember your parents teaching you
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.080]   how to have a conversation?
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   I think it actually, they, I'm trying to think.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.880]   It was very synonymous in like my young mind
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   with how to, what is it?
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.680]   Interact with the world, like even physically.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.520]   - Okay.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.120]   - There was a connection between the visible
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.600]   and the invisible in this way.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.120]   It's like, just like when you're doing a foot race,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.440]   you don't stick out your foot
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.760]   and trip the person that's running next to you.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.600]   - Right.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.160]   - That's mean and they'll get hurt.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.560]   The most important thing I remember being kind of drilled
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.400]   into me when I was young was don't interrupt
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.960]   and respond when you're spoken to.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.560]   Those were the two most important things
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.680]   that I remember learning.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.240]   And then, yeah, just how they were connected
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   with just not being, you know, mean, aggressive or violent.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.640]   - Yes.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.480]   - As it's kind of, 'cause we do that, right?
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.680]   Like we're mean, aggressive and violent
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.000]   in the conversational space.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.400]   And we get away with it in ways that we don't
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.080]   inside the physical world.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.800]   So that's important.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.720]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.400]   With little kids, it's funny.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.600]   With young children, I think it's natural
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.400]   for us to start saying what not to do, okay?
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.280]   So like your parents taught you, don't interrupt.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.160]   Don't stand there silent.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.000]   If somebody is talking to you, you need to answer.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.640]   I can remember when my girls were really little,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.160]   it was really important to me.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.840]   Like, it sounds like it was important to your mom and dad
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.080]   that they not hurt people's feelings
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.840]   and that they learn how to conduct themselves
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.200]   in a way that would build other people up.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.720]   And so we, I went to enough little kid birthday parties
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.120]   and saw enough atrocious behavior
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.320]   by birthday boy or girl opening gifts
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.240]   that we used to practice.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.240]   Before the girls had birthday parties, we would practice.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.640]   And I would say, "What would you do,
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.040]   what will you do if you get a present that you don't like?"
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.760]   And so we would brainstorm.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.560]   What do you say in this situation?
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.040]   You say, "Thank you very much."
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   You could just say, "I've never seen one like this before,"
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.080]   or, "I don't have one," or, "Thank you for thinking of me."
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.600]   So we would say, and I would say,
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.800]   "So what do you do if you get a present?"
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.760]   'Cause little children,
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.920]   I'm talking three and four and five-year-olds,
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.280]   they will say absolutely anything.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.080]   They're just super honest.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.560]   And sometimes that honesty is not what you want
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   to come out at the party.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.760]   So we would practice, "What will you do
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.560]   if you get a present that's like what you already have?"
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.200]   Okay, so right out is, "I've already got this,"
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.000]   or, "I don't want another one of these,"
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.440]   or, "I like the blue one better."
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.320]   No, we're not saying that.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.880]   So what do we say?
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   So we practice saying, "That's one of my favorite things,"
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:06.240]   or, "I've always liked that," which is perfectly true,
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.600]   but it affirms the person.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   So I think one of the ways
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.160]   that we teach our children to be conversationalists
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   is actually to practice what to say in different situations.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.880]   It's like modeling somehow.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.320]   - Definitely, definitely.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.960]   There's a training, right?
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.320]   There's a training that has to take place.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.600]   'Cause it is like there's this idea that,
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.640]   like let's say if conversation is a game
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.720]   and young children don't really know the rules
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.680]   of the game yet, they can't play the game,
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   which means they need to be taught the rules of the game.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:47.000]   But at the same time, those that play the game
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.080]   can learn virtue from those
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.960]   that are learning to play the game.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.720]   Because I think one of the most profound things
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.080]   that I've noticed, like I've done,
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.760]   taught Sunday school or church school a couple of times.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.160]   And one of the things that I just appreciate so deeply
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.160]   about young kids is that they are kind of honest
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.560]   in that way that sometimes we're not for the sake of,
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.840]   I feel like if I said this,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.520]   I might hurt somebody else's feelings,
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.160]   but the children bring this kind of revelation sometimes
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.920]   of something that you're doing inside the game
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.680]   that's not really helpful.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.400]   - That is really true.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.600]   That's a good insight too, Daniel.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.760]   - So yeah, I think that just the honesty of children
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.720]   is definitely a virtue.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.520]   Also, maybe we could add that in
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.800]   to the dynamic of good conversation,
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.720]   the not being--
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.080]   - Yeah, honesty with kindness.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.280]   - Correct, yeah, not being afraid always to,
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   well, I think it goes to maybe even an experience
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.760]   in the challenge classroom, right?
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.480]   Being in front of students or in foundations,
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.640]   like not being afraid to ask a question
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.160]   that you feel like the answer to is obvious.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.840]   - Yes, yes.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.640]   - Right, which a kid will do.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.680]   A kid will do that.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.720]   And that's not even like an illegal move in the game.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   That's not-- - That's right, that's right.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.560]   - That's a really important move inside the game.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.200]   And again, we maybe have gotten comfortable
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.960]   or we feel like we're too far down.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.320]   We spent too much time to ask those obvious questions now,
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.160]   and we might look foolish by asking those questions
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.640]   and undermine the confidence and respect
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.680]   that others have grown for us.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.680]   But really, if we need to ask that question,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.800]   that question should be asked.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.880]   And our kind of pride should be set aside.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.000]   And we can assume the posture of child likeness again.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.600]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.520]   - And so, yeah, I think there's a lot to learn.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.360]   - That's good.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.200]   We can actually asking simple questions
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.760]   sometimes opens up really deep discussions.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.920]   It brings people back 'cause people will hear
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.440]   and quote, unquote, obvious question in a fresh way
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.920]   if posed unexpectedly.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:24.480]   I think that's a good key.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.400]   That is a good key.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.600]   I know that in Classical Conversations,
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.720]   we offer our children and our young people
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.200]   lots of opportunities to grow
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.800]   in their conversational skills.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   Even our Little Foundations students do presentations
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.480]   and take questions from the audience.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   That's a beginning way to have a conversation.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.280]   You let somebody ask you a question
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.640]   and you provide information from them.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.720]   And yes, I have been in Foundations communities
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.400]   and I know that lots of the questions are the same old,
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.960]   like Daniel said, obvious questions.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.800]   But that's how children learn.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.880]   They learn a process.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.200]   They learn to make eye contact and to listen
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.960]   and to respond to what was asked
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.680]   and not just tell more of what they want to share.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.920]   And so that's really good.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.880]   And then our older kids,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.040]   what are some of the ways that our older students, Daniel,
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:31.040]   learn to manage and lead conversations,
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.880]   say in the high school years?
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   - Yeah, so I think,
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.080]   well, they learn all sorts of different tools, right?
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.440]   So I would think that when they're,
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.320]   obviously there's resources inside the challenge guides
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.400]   to help students learn how to be student leaders
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.560]   and different seminars in the upper challenges.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.720]   We equip them with,
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.680]   hopefully they've kind of ingrained
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.440]   the five habits into themselves.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.600]   They've learned the common topics.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.960]   They've practiced the canons of rhetoric.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.200]   And so those are all helpful tools
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.680]   for them to be able to use.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:12.640]   I love the common topic of definition.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.320]   And so this is one of the things,
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.080]   and I try to kind of bring a new freshness to it
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.640]   with some of my students
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.160]   that I tutor in the challenge program
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.800]   by kind of after they've written their first essay
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.640]   or something like that.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.240]   And I see a Merriam-Webster definition
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.120]   inside the introduction of their paper
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.280]   because they want you to have like a solid definition base.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.720]   I'm like, "Hey, write your own definition.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.120]   "I don't like Merriam-Webster."
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.960]   And they're like, "No, it's gonna force you to think
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.160]   "and to dig deeper into the genus
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.280]   "and the difference of this term
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.640]   "that you're trying to wrestle through and define."
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.440]   And so by proposing your own definition
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.880]   inside this genus difference manner,
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.840]   you actually are being more vulnerable with your audience,
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.680]   something like that.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.760]   You're inviting more participation and more questions
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.560]   'cause they're like, "Oh, you really think that like,
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.560]   "I don't know, beluga whales are a genus of creatures
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.160]   "in the Odyssey or something like that."
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.200]   Opposite way.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.840]   So it invites more conversation.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   It keeps things fresher and more interesting.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   And so I really, the tools of the five common topics,
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.440]   I feel like applied well and demonstrated.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.960]   Obviously we learn these skills through,
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.080]   we learn these skills through imitation,
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.200]   through mimesis, right?
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.400]   Adler has the facts, skills, and ideas
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.880]   of the things that we deal with in education all the time.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.560]   And we teach facts didactically.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.000]   We tell like you're talking about sun and shade
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.480]   with your grand grandchild.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.560]   And then with ideas, we teach them Socratically
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.120]   through discussion and conversation back and forth,
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.920]   descent into the ironic and kind of a reunification
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.000]   and a coming back together.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.080]   And then skills we teach mimetically,
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.320]   we teach them through imitation.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:21.120]   And so we teach our students to the level of mastery
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.520]   that we possess to a certain degree.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.600]   And so it doesn't have to be amazing,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.080]   but we should really like try to hone these tools ourselves
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.480]   and freshen them up in our minds
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:37.480]   so that we can play with definition
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.920]   and not be afraid of it.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.760]   We can play with this and really enjoy
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.840]   that domain of comparative definition.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:50.800]   And then relationship, circumstance, testimony,
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.480]   all of these things will really enrich
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.800]   that kind of community conversation.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   - Yeah, yeah, that's really good.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.200]   Thank you for bringing out the five common topics.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:08.200]   There are lots of skills that we practice
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:14.520]   as classical educators and as classical learners
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.400]   and parents, these skills you can practice
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.280]   as lead learners at home will help you
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   as you start and participate in good conversations
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.480]   and will help you help your students
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:37.720]   learn how to be part of a good conversation.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.520]   So Daniel, I'm just looked up and discovered
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.880]   that we have been talking about talking for a long time.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.280]   And so we have to bring it to a close.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.040]   I want, as we end our time together,
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.160]   your, what would you say?
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.480]   And maybe you've already said it
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.200]   and this will just offer you a chance
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.560]   to reiterate something important.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.200]   What would be your best tip
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.520]   for having meaningful conversations at home?
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.760]   - I think that my best tip
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:13.080]   for having meaningful conversations at home
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   would be to pay attention to,
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   like, let's say with a younger student,
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.520]   it would be just releasing them from the,
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.720]   well, I guess with the older students as well,
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.560]   releasing from the familiar and allowing novelty
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.960]   to enter into the space of the conversation
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.920]   to the perspective of the person, that's huge.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.720]   And then also for older students,
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:48.680]   for older students recognizing that really at that point,
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.600]   the heart is developing a lot, right?
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.040]   It's kind of struggling through the desires,
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.120]   their own desires, the things that they care about
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.960]   are becoming more manifest
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.800]   and they're becoming the most important things to them.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   And so kind of having that awareness of the desires
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:12.240]   of your student's heart and the conversation,
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.800]   like allowing the conversation to explore those desires
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.440]   rather than shutting them down and shutting them off,
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.360]   I feel like is really profoundly important
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   for good conversations
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   as kids get into high school and beyond.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.000]   What are they after?
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.440]   'Cause those things are gonna be
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:32.280]   where their conversation is gonna take place.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.920]   If they don't care about it, they won't talk about it.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.480]   - That is good.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.680]   It comes down to being sensitive,
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.520]   to paying attention to the cues of your partner
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.960]   and preparing your heart in advance, I think,
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.480]   to let your conversational partner
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.520]   go in the direction they want to go and grow,
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   not where you have pigeonholed them or expect them to go.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:09.200]   Really, really good helps and insights, Daniel.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   I appreciate this.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.160]   This has been a lot of fun to me
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.240]   and I have to say, I find you a very good conversationalist.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.600]   Thanks for being with me today.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.680]   - Yeah, dittos, Lisa.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.440]   I appreciate your thoughtful questions.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.280]   - It's great.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.560]   Families, I hope that this will bless you
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.600]   and will bless the conversations
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.240]   that you have with your families going forward.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:36.240]   If you are new to this whole idea of classical education
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.160]   and we have piqued your interest at all,
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:44.760]   I want you to know that you can go
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   to classicalconversations.com/events
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:55.360]   and find a list of information meetings near you
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.040]   or even an information meeting online
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.160]   that can answer some of the questions that you may have
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.200]   if you're interested in homeschooling,
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.720]   if you are interested in classical education
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.400]   or in classical conversations in particular,
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.240]   you will discover our Christ-centered
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.200]   classical approach to education
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.000]   and you'll have the opportunity to connect
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   to some experienced CC parents
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.880]   that can answer your questions right away.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   So again, that's classicalconversations.com/events
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:39.240]   and you'll find out about our information meetings.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.680]   It has been awesome talking to you today
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.640]   and I will look forward to it again next week.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.480]   Bye-bye.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.560]   (gentle music)
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.620]   you
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:55:00.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
