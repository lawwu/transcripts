[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   - Let's throw a curveball at you first.
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.800]   Let's try a quick hypothetical question.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.600]   If I told you right now that I have with me,
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.640]   I brought, I told you I'm Russian,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.900]   I brought with me back in the car two guys,
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.240]   they're waiting outside, both are 73 kg players.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.920]   They happen to be in the top 10 of the world.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.000]   One is Russian, the other is Japanese,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.240]   and I'll give you one million dollars
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.440]   if you beat one of them in judo, in a judo match.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.600]   Which one do you fight?
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.100]   - Oh, tough question.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.160]   - A Russian or a Japanese, which one would you face?
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.520]   - I think I'd take my shot against the Russian.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.360]   - Oh wow.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.600]   (laughs)
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.740]   - So the reason is, they're so much more technical.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.780]   The Russians obviously have great judo, explosive power.
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.960]   Don't get me wrong, I mean, it's a tough decision
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.840]   either way, but when I look back at my statistics
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.600]   and which style of player I beat more often,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.180]   I had more success against Russians
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.840]   than I did against Japanese.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.120]   - All right, that's the voice of Jimmy Pedro.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.480]   I'm here at the Pedro Judo Center,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.960]   talking with Jimmy, a legendary judo competitor and coach.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.040]   He represented the United States at four Olympics,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.040]   '92, '96, 2000, 2004, winning bronze at two of them.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.800]   He medaled in three world championships, winning gold in '99.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   He has coached many, if most, elite level American judoka,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.000]   including Kayla Harrison, Ronda, Ronda Rousey,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.760]   Travis Stevens, Rick Hawn, Alex Otiano,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.120]   Taraji Williams, Roddy Ferguson, the Roddy Ferguson.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.240]   They work together, as many people know, and many others.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.600]   Four of those people have been on this podcast.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.280]   - Nice.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.780]   - Your first judo coach was your dad,
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.680]   still your judo coach.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.640]   - Always will be.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.960]   - Always will be.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.800]   Can you talk about your relationship with your dad
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.480]   when you first started judo?
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.160]   Did he put a lot of pressure on you to win?
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.080]   - So my dad, for those of you that have ever had
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.400]   the privilege of meeting him, he's unforgettable.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   When I was a kid, judo was mandatory.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.060]   There was no such thing as I don't wanna go to judo today.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.880]   It was you're going to judo tonight, and it was every night.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.500]   We only had practice when I was a little boy,
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.720]   three days a week, but I was at the dojo
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.800]   five, six days a week running around the mats
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.520]   and watching classes and things like that.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.040]   But my dad was very hard on me as a youngster,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.800]   pushed me to compete, pushed me to train.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.200]   He gave me exercise routines to do.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.660]   When I wasn't doing judo, I had to do conditioning
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.640]   off the mat, that he'd run me through circuit training
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.460]   and stuff like that.
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.740]   So yeah, my dad was a very demanding father,
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.000]   but his mentality was that he knew judo
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.240]   would be good for me, not just to become a great athlete,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.620]   but for the life lessons that I would learn
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.320]   through the sport of judo and what it would do
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.400]   to help me become a better person.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.560]   - Yeah, build your character.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.920]   - Yeah, many parents want their kids to eat vegetables
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.640]   because it's good for them and eat healthy
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.520]   'cause it's what they want.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.360]   My father wanted me to do judo
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.640]   'cause of what it could do for me.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.960]   - And so, I mean, that is a story of a lot of greats
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.000]   in sport and wrestling and judo.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   So the question for me is, you're a father now,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.680]   you're a coach now, do you and did your dad struggle
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.520]   with that balance between letting your kid
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.120]   do whatever they want and dragging them,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.820]   kicking and screaming to training?
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.600]   - Well, I'm a different father than my dad was,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.640]   but I also have, my kids have to live in different shoes
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.240]   than I had to live in.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.400]   So my father wasn't an Olympic champion.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.720]   He wasn't a national hero.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.560]   And he fell short of making the Olympics himself.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.160]   So I was almost doing it with him and for him.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.760]   Whereas my kids feel like they're doing it for me.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.920]   Every tournament they go to, they have a ton of pressure
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.460]   'cause the whole world is watching them
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.180]   because they're Jimmy Pedro's son.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.520]   And there's a lot of parents that can be obnoxious.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.200]   And when their kid beats my kid,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.080]   it's the biggest deal in the world.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.000]   So my kids have to deal with all that pressure
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.980]   that no kid should have to deal with.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.220]   So I'm a different father.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.660]   I give my children the choice of what sports to play.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.460]   Of course, as young individuals, they all did judo.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.820]   They all competed up until they were teenagers.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.380]   But at that point, I let them decide what sports
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.540]   they wanna play, what they wanna do.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.480]   Right now, I have a son who's ranked number one
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.780]   in the nation in the sport of wrestling
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.540]   as a sophomore in high school.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.980]   He chose wrestling as a sport.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.900]   I have a daughter that went on to play hockey and softball.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.300]   And now she's a freshman in college at Bentley University.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.260]   But I think that the judo training that they did get
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.940]   when they were young helped mold them as individuals
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.980]   and as good people.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.780]   And so I wanted them to do it for that same reason.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.580]   - So you think it's possible?
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.580]   Well, certainly it's possible.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.220]   But do you think that's the path to success
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.060]   is it doesn't have to require excessive pressure
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.500]   from the coaches and the parenting in the early years?
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.060]   - Everybody's different.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.260]   I think everybody is different in response
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.800]   to that pressure differently.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.340]   Had I been given a choice, I could tell you right now,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.820]   I probably wouldn't ever have made any Olympic teams
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.860]   or I wouldn't have excelled in the sport of judo at all
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.060]   'cause it's not something I would have pursued.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.320]   My dad didn't give me the choice.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.300]   And it wasn't until I was about 15 years old
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.140]   where I started to become a man
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.520]   and I started to really wanna do the sport of judo
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.100]   for myself.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.020]   Up until that point, I was too immature
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.860]   and didn't understand the dynamic of what was going on.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.900]   And I felt all that pressure from my father
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.920]   and I despised going to training sometimes
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.600]   or it was difficult.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.180]   But as 15, 16, I was like,
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.340]   hey, I'm pretty damn good at this thing.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.660]   I like winning and I like being around other athletes
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.580]   and I get to see the, at 15, 16, you start to travel,
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.300]   you start to go away from home,
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.660]   you go into camps in Oklahoma or Florida,
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.260]   you're going on trips overseas
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.900]   and it starts to become fun as a teenager, right?
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.740]   You get to see the world.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.020]   So that's when I started doing it for me
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.180]   and that's when it really became enjoyable.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.060]   - And so in those years, late teens,
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.980]   how did your relationship evolve with your dad?
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.380]   - Then it really became, I was motivated.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.460]   I was always a self-motivated kid anyway,
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.100]   but really when I was 15 to 16, I turned the corner
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.780]   and I decided that I was given 100% all the time
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.620]   and my dad truly became not just a father,
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.300]   but I saw him as a great coach,
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.140]   somebody that had a wealth of knowledge
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.980]   that knew how to train athletes,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.300]   that knew how to get the most out of his athletes
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.540]   and that actually exposed me to the world.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.780]   I think the biggest credit I can give to my father
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.960]   as a coach is that he sent me away
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.900]   to learn from other people.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.440]   The biggest mistake most coaches make
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.020]   is that they keep their students to themselves
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.480]   and they hold them back from reaching their potential
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.460]   because they're afraid that that student's
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.220]   gonna go on and learn something special from somebody else
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.820]   and no longer give their original coach credit.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.940]   - And especially as a father, that must be a scary thing
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.780]   to sort of give up your son to somebody else.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.500]   - Right, but my dad had said, he said,
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.980]   "Sana, technically I've taken you as far as I can take you
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.660]   "and since I never made the Olympic team,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.660]   "I wanna surround you with greatness.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.820]   "I want you to go see that these other athletes
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.880]   "are just people too and that they're not these heroes
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.200]   "that you put on big pedestals,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.620]   "but they're everyday ordinary people that make mistakes,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.580]   "that fall down, that get back up.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.080]   "And I want you to be around them because champions,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.740]   "be around champions to be a champion.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.180]   "See how they act, see how they behave,
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.580]   "see how they think and also learn from them."
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.960]   And my dad sent me to all the best coaches in America
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.500]   at the time, which were Erwin Cohen,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.340]   who recently passed away,
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.640]   and Patrick Burris, who was on two Olympic teams.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.180]   And I went to Neil Adams in England and I learned from Neil
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.980]   and he sent me to Japan and sent me to Germany
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.680]   and Gunther Neureiter and I learned
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.280]   from some good coaches in Japan.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.160]   And I picked up something everywhere I went.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.780]   My dad said, "Hey, I'm gonna send you away.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.800]   "Don't just train, I want you to learn.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.820]   "I want you to bring back a new technique
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.520]   "from everywhere you go and show me what it is."
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.720]   And I can tell you that as I gathered all that,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.060]   all those new techniques and all that new knowledge,
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.000]   to this day I can tell you who I learned
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   all of the different techniques that I did in my career
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.560]   from, which is amazing.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.500]   So that's the biggest mistake I think that most coaches make
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.340]   is they don't allow their students to flourish
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.540]   and to be exposed to the rest of the world.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.540]   And I give my dad a lot of credit
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.080]   for having the foresight to do that for me.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.700]   - Is now on a slightly darker side,
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.300]   was there, as a competitor,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.900]   was there ever a time you considered quitting judo?
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.160]   - Absolutely, every champion wants to quit.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.140]   I can tell you numerous times.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.660]   When I was only 16 years old,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.140]   I went to the US Open in judo.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.180]   At the time it was one of the hardest tournaments
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.100]   in the world because the whole world
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.660]   loved coming to America to compete.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.660]   So we had Japanese and we had Russians
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.340]   and we had French and we had Brazilians.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.660]   And as a young boy it was a super hard tournament to compete
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.800]   and I competed against all the men.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.140]   And at that tournament I had a great day.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.140]   I lost to Eddie Liddy who took third in the Olympics in '84.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.420]   And then I battled back and I was fighting
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.000]   for a bronze medal against the guy from Korea.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.460]   And I scored in the first like 30 seconds,
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.620]   I threw the Korean guy.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.680]   And he was a man, he was 24 years old,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.780]   strong as heck and physical and technical.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.100]   And I was just this little scrappy,
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.940]   wiry 16 year old, right?
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.800]   But I threw him, I scored right away
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.100]   and then he just grabbed me and manhandled me
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.940]   across the match.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.140]   He started shaking my gi and snapping my gi
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.480]   and I ended up getting three penalties
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.740]   and losing the fight.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.260]   My father went nutso on me.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.340]   He yelled and he screamed at me,
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.980]   he embarrassed me in front of everybody.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.940]   - What was your mistake in that match?
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.500]   - According to my father, I fought afraid.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.980]   I was scared to lose but physically
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.380]   I couldn't match this guy.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.260]   So anyway, long story short, I went out in the snow,
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.460]   took my gi off, laid down in Colorado Springs
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.100]   in the snow and just cried.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.380]   Just fought my heart out, fought like eight fights.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.620]   I lost for a bronze medal at 16 years old
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.180]   in one of the toughest tournaments
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.620]   and I felt like a failure.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.620]   My dad, and I felt like my dad hated me.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.040]   And he embarrassed me in front of everybody
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.100]   so I wanted to quit.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.720]   I had another time, I was in Japan
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.140]   and I had spent six weeks training in Japan
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.780]   and I went to the Kano Cup.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.900]   And the Kano Cup is one of the best tournaments
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.260]   in the world and at that tournament,
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.300]   I sucked a lot of weight after being in Japan
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.940]   for six weeks.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.060]   I sucked a ton of weight and I was all excited to fight.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.180]   Well, my first round was against Sergei Kosminin.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.100]   Kosminin was a Russian.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.340]   First match of the tournament,
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.340]   Kosminin threw me free pwn.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.820]   I had no idea who he was.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.100]   I was all pissed off and upset.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.380]   Kosminin then threw Nakamura free pwn.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.500]   And then so my, and Kosminin went on
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.860]   and he won the tournament, he took first.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.860]   My second round was against Nakamura.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.860]   He beat me by pwn.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.660]   So I went 0-2 in the Kano Cup
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.660]   after being in Japan for six weeks,
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.660]   dieting and losing a lot of weight,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.220]   made all this sacrifice.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.860]   I remember sitting on the steps at the Budokan
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.460]   at 19 years old thinking to myself,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.620]   I hate this sport.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.900]   I just wanna quit.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.780]   This stinks.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.660]   - So how do you find the will?
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.380]   Where do you find, how do you continue?
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.220]   Every champion wants to quit.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.060]   I love that.
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.340]   That's brilliant, yeah.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.840]   You know, it's lost as part of that.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.700]   - The hardest thing, I think the thing
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.180]   that most people don't realize
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.380]   is that they only see champions as winners.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.140]   They only see the times when they succeed.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.020]   They don't see those dark days.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.900]   They don't see those days where they struggled
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.060]   or they lost or they failed
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.780]   or the day in training where they got their butts whooped.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.820]   Right?
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.140]   Or those tournaments where they just fought miserable.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.820]   Nobody ever hears about those days.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.980]   But we all go through it
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.860]   because nobody goes undefeated in their career.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.080]   It doesn't happen.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.620]   So really what makes champions is
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.420]   how do you wanna go out?
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.860]   You know, do you want that to be your last competition?
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.100]   Do you wanna go out as a loser, as a quitter?
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.020]   - Right.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.020]   - Or are you gonna suck it up, learn from the loss,
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.220]   dig deeper, get better, re-motivate yourself
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.900]   and become a champion?
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.940]   And I think that was my mindset my whole career.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.540]   I wanted to be on the top of the world.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.500]   I wanted to be top of the podium.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.720]   Worlds or Olympics, that was my goal.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.940]   And quite honestly, that same guy, Kozminian,
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.660]   you know, he beat me in the '91 Worlds the next year.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.140]   And then finally in '92,
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.260]   I got him in the finals of the Italian tournament,
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.620]   the Guido Sienni, and I beat him in that tournament.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.020]   So, you know, perseverance and tenacity
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.980]   and sometimes it pays off.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.380]   - Is there something you regret
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.820]   about your early judo years in terms of training?
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.260]   Something you wish you would have done differently?
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.640]   - I think early days, no, because, you know,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.420]   I played a lot of sports as a kid.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.520]   My dad allowed me.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.060]   I played, you know, football, Papuan or football.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.980]   I played baseball as a young kid.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.660]   I wrestled in high school.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.180]   I did judo.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.420]   So I had a good balance to my adolescent years
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:40.060]   and my childhood where I got to play a lot of sports
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.380]   and learn a lot of things about teamwork
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.780]   and really found out that the best thing about judo
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.380]   and wrestling and individual sports
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.460]   is that you ultimately decide how good you're gonna be.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.340]   You don't have to rely on the rest of your team
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.380]   or you don't have to worry about having a crappy coach
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.920]   or, you know, being in a bad situation.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.940]   You get out of it what you put into it.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.540]   So I don't think I regret anything as a youngster
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.540]   other than I wish I could have enjoyed it more as a child.
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:13.020]   You know, I went undefeated in judo until I was 11 years old
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.540]   and I fought when I was six.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.260]   So I fought six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.100]   I didn't lose a match until I was 11 years old
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.700]   and that was the finals of the national championships.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.360]   So think about the pressure of going undefeated
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.340]   for all those years.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.580]   - You're scared of losing.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.460]   - Right. - Basically.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.720]   - Right, and having your father always bump you up
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.420]   to the next weight class or fight the harder person
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.820]   or in the next age category,
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.720]   you're always challenging yourself.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.860]   So to have all that pressure
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.500]   and push the envelope and the threshold,
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.380]   I had anxiety about every tournament I went into.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.980]   Up until I finally lost.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.180]   - Right.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.140]   You talk often, you yourself are a graduate of Brown.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.940]   You talk often about the value of education.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.940]   So do you think there's room for life outside of judo
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.540]   for somebody who wants to make the podium at the Olympics?
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.900]   - Absolutely.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.180]   With unquestionably, I believe that athletes
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.940]   who live a balanced life,
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.540]   who don't put all of their energy into just sport,
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.260]   end up becoming better athletes.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.660]   Because when you fail in sport,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.260]   you feel like a complete failure if that's all you do.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.420]   But if you have something else
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.740]   that you're pursuing parallel to the sport,
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.820]   whether it's an education or whether it's a career
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.300]   or whether it's family,
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.980]   if you have something else in your life
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.000]   that you can put your energy to
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.060]   that makes you feel good about yourself,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.500]   then they kind of balance each other out.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.940]   So if I fail in sport, but I get an A on this exam,
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.340]   I still feel good about myself.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.860]   Or if I do lousy in school, but I just won this tournament,
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.060]   I feel good about myself
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.380]   because I found some reward in something I did.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.900]   Whereas if all you do is sport and you fail,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.140]   then you have nothing else.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.540]   You feel like I sacrificed everything I gave,
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.060]   everything for this moment and it didn't happen.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.780]   So I think the lows end up being lower.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.940]   And that's why I encourage my athletes
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.820]   to either teach other students,
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.460]   get involved in some other way.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.100]   Like they can take pride
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.200]   in their students winning tournaments.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.820]   That's a parallel path.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.900]   Or like I said, education or work or something else
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.540]   to provide some sort of enjoyment.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.260]   - So you don't think that's a negative distraction
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.580]   to that one singular focus towards the--
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.980]   - I think there's certain times
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.620]   where obviously six months before the Olympic games,
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.580]   it's time to focus and put all your energy into sport.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.060]   Okay, so when I was at Brown, I took a break from Brown
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.300]   and I focused just on training in judo in the Olympics.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.160]   But I had never really put my life on hold for sport.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.240]   I had kids.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.020]   Before I won the 99 worlds,
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.180]   I mean, I had two kids already and one on the way.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.260]   So I was a father and coming home
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.260]   from a long training trip or competition run overseas
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.440]   and coming home and seeing your two and three year olds
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.020]   run up to you and you're like, "Daddy."
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.580]   You forget about that guy that just whooped your butt
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.900]   in Russia or wherever it was, right?
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.100]   You know, it brings new perspective to life.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.940]   - So you medaled in '91 at the worlds
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.900]   and in 2004 at the Olympics and many times in between.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.500]   So that's at least 13 years
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   of being one of the best judo competitors in the world.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.220]   So what would you attribute that longevity to?
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.700]   For so long being at the top?
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.260]   - Well, like I said, I wanted to be the best in the world.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.380]   So my motivation was to be world or Olympic champion.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.700]   - There's an injury in there too.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.580]   - There's a bad injury in there, yes.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.180]   Well, and that also plays into every,
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.700]   you know, everything happens for a reason
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.340]   and everything plays into what you ultimately become.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.140]   My injury was pretty devastating.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.080]   - Can you describe that by the way
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.820]   for people that don't know?
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:15.700]   - I actually was in a tournament in the finals of Korea
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.100]   and I got picked up and thrown on my head in that tournament
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.220]   and really instead of taking the fall and just losing,
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.980]   stuck my head out and I came right down
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.420]   on the top of my head and then my feet went over
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.900]   and I did a bridge.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.200]   I didn't think anything of it.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.120]   I got up and I finished the fight and I lost.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.540]   But then going home on the airplane,
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.060]   I noticed that it got harder and harder
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.520]   to lift my chin up off of my chest.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.860]   By the time I landed in Boston,
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.020]   the neck and the disc had swollen so much
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.020]   that it was hitting the spinal cord.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.380]   And so my chin got pinned to my chest
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.320]   and then I just had radiating, shooting pain down my arm,
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.060]   into my hand and it was numb.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.620]   And it was like that for quite a while.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.760]   So obviously I went to the doctors.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.180]   The first MRI, doctor said, "You will never,"
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.220]   he said, "Jimmy, I'm sorry,
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.700]   "but you will never do sports again in your life."
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.460]   He said, "I hope that someday I can get you
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.500]   "to become just a normal functioning human being again."
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.540]   And I remember going, and I cried.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.180]   I remember being in the elevator at 23 years old,
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.900]   thinking that my entire career is over.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.980]   And at the same time, I couldn't sleep
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.820]   because I couldn't lay down in a bed.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.720]   My chin had to stay here and my arm had to stay here
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.400]   or else the pain was excruciating.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.540]   If I lifted my head in any way, I just couldn't move.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.820]   Well, that whole arm and that chest muscle
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.440]   and tricep shrunk to zero.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.060]   All the nerve damage happened on the right side.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.080]   So I slept many a nights just sitting in a traction unit
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.720]   with a weight over the door in my dorm room.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.580]   And I would just sit there with my head trying to pull up
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.680]   and I would try to sleep
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.120]   because it was the only time I could ever get comfortable.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.540]   But it was miserable.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.440]   I had about six months of living like that.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.560]   - For how long did you believe this is it,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.680]   that you're not doing judo ever again?
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.560]   - The entire time I was injured and the pain,
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.320]   the pain wouldn't go away in the arm.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.160]   It was just like a dull throbbing pain
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.680]   shooting down the arm.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.120]   And you had no feeling in your hand.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.860]   So I knew it was serious.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.580]   And I tell you, sometimes the only thing I could do
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.440]   was I would drink like eight or 10 beers to pass out.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.380]   I couldn't stand the pain.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.080]   I couldn't move.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.880]   I didn't sleep in a bed for that whole time.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.320]   And then even when it started, I got lucky.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.600]   I just kept taking anti-inflammatories.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.880]   I kept doing the traction.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.620]   And I think I just got lucky over time.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.280]   The nerve regenerated itself.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.880]   The disc started to go back in.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.400]   I never had surgery.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.780]   And I started getting a little bit of range of motion back.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.060]   And then I was so excited.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.320]   I went back to the doctor and I said,
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.640]   "Doc, I know you said I'm never gonna do judo again,
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.520]   "but I can move my head now."
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.220]   And the guy was like, "You've made a lot of progress."
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.040]   And he said, "Okay, now still, I don't want you to run.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.940]   "You can't do judo, no wrestling."
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.380]   I said, "But I want you to go back in the weight room
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.180]   "and I want you to start retraining that muscle
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.460]   "and those muscles to move again."
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.780]   And I remember the first day on the Nautilus machine,
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.980]   no weight, there was no weight on the thing.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.580]   I pulled the pin out and my arm was just like this.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.160]   And I would just straighten it and I would pull it back
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.120]   and I would straighten it and I would just keep trying
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.440]   to train my muscles to move.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.100]   First time on the bench press, just the bar.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.880]   I remember all these girls in the weight room at Brown
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.280]   and they're all pushing weight
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.940]   and I remember taking the bar off.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.260]   And I would try to get that off.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.820]   I just, yeah, it just shook and it just,
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.560]   and it took a lot of rehab to get that.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.480]   And then finally, over time, I got stronger and stronger.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.340]   And he said, "Started to train neck muscles and traps."
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.700]   And it came back and it took about nine months
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.060]   to be back strong enough where I could get back on the mat
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.260]   and start doing what you call me and start to train again.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.180]   - It's incredible.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.820]   And then almost 10 years after that,
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.860]   right, the Olympics. - Yeah.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.860]   - So how is the Jimmy Pedro of 1991
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.340]   different from the one of 2004?
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.780]   So at the beginning of the dominance to the end of the-
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.780]   - I would say that the young Jimmy Pedro was fearless,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:47.480]   was raw, talented, just gritty, and got after it.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.940]   Just tough, just went after it.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.780]   - Fast.
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.660]   - Yeah, not so explosive though
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.380]   'cause I cut a lot of weight when I was younger.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.300]   So I wasn't so explosive in '91.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.060]   And my best years in the sport of judo
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.060]   were between '95 and '99 was when I was explosive,
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:13.780]   technical, really strong on the mat,
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.340]   physically real explosive.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.420]   My judo was real technical.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.900]   Those were my best years in the sport, '95 to '99.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.460]   In fact, '95, I look back
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.220]   and I should have been in the finals
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.060]   of the world's that year.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.020]   I could have been world champion in '95.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.560]   I lost to a Korean in the semifinals by a split decision.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.380]   And it was a split flag decision that I thought I won.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.060]   And I think the Korean thought I won.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.820]   In that year, the Japanese who won the world's
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.420]   three months later, I beat him pretty easily in Germany.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.260]   So I thought I should have been world champion '95.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.840]   And then two weeks before the '97 world championships,
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.700]   which I was undefeated like the whole year,
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.180]   winning everything.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.500]   Two weeks before I was supposed to go
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.140]   to world championships, I went to a training camp
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.460]   that the coach talked me into going to.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.500]   And two of the heavyweights,
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   one guy got thrown into my leg and he took my MCL.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.140]   I had a second degree sprain of my MCL.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.420]   He just fell into it, but it swelled up.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.140]   And it was only two weeks before I had to step
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.580]   on the mat at the world's.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.380]   And that MCL couldn't heal in time.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.880]   So I didn't actually fight in the '97 world championships
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.980]   as a result of that.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.260]   But '99, I was 98, 99.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.500]   I don't think I lost maybe two, three times
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.100]   in that whole run.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.720]   And really it was because I competed
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.180]   so many tournaments right in a row,
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.820]   one week after another week after another week,
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.340]   your body gets broken down.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:55.460]   But then 2004, I retired after 2000
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.260]   only because I told my family that,
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.420]   all right, this is the end of my run.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.540]   I'm supposed to win the Olympics.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.980]   This will be my last Olympics.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.060]   It's time to start life.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.460]   My wife has sacrificed 12 years
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.340]   waiting for me to come home.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.220]   And when I didn't win in Sydney, I started life.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.900]   I started working and I just didn't want to go out
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.500]   as a loser, as somebody who didn't medal in the Olympics.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.140]   And I just couldn't accept it.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.660]   So I was inspired at the 2002 Olympic games.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.940]   And I was really inspired by that.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.500]   And I said, Maria, I want to do this one more time.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.420]   So she said, of course, I knew this was coming
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.680]   and by all means, let's do it.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.900]   And that was the most enjoyable two years of my life.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.580]   From 2002 to 2004, I was in the finals
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.280]   of every single tournament.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.580]   Every tournament I made the finals, all the way through,
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.780]   no matter what tournament it was.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.780]   And I just enjoyed the life of an athlete again.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.100]   And you can be selfish, you can focus on yourself,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.420]   you can train, you feel great.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.460]   You never get that same feeling out of anything else in life
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.620]   as being a winner or a champion
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.540]   or having the crowd roar.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.180]   And you don't get that from anything else.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.100]   I'm in business and I can do some big deals,
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.460]   but it's still not that same feeling.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.740]   - Yeah, it's all on you.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.060]   All eyes are on you.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.300]   It's all up to you.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.620]   - Right, it's awesome.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.280]   And so I enjoyed that.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.700]   And so as 2004 athlete, I was physically strong.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.300]   I had the- - Great cardio.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.960]   - I had great cardio.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.340]   I was efficient with my muscles.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.380]   I knew how to spend energy.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.940]   I wasn't as good of a judo player in 2004
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.600]   as I was in '95 to '99, but good enough to win.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.260]   - Do you think, to be poetic for a moment,
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.760]   do you think, like you said, with age,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.580]   athletes lose the fearlessness of youth?
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.020]   How essential is that?
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:58.460]   That stupid, being brave and stupid
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.820]   and your singular focus on this just drive.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.660]   - Absolutely.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.620]   You know, I think it's a good balance.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.100]   It depends on how the athlete deals with the pressure.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:15.100]   You know, going into the 19, going into the 2000 Olympics,
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.900]   I was '99 world champion.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.740]   So all eyes were on me to win the gold, right?
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.740]   All the newspapers, all the magazines,
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.340]   everybody was talking about America's first ever gold.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.000]   So I had all that pressure on me.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.600]   [coughs]
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   And it wasn't that the pressure got to me.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.720]   It's just that first round,
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.640]   I had the Korean guy was top five guy in the world
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.980]   and he was always a tough match for me.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.840]   So I just didn't, wasn't meant to be.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.000]   But going into 2004, I was old, I had experience,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.960]   but I wanted it.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.120]   I was hungry again.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.040]   I wasn't afraid.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.020]   I didn't have pressure.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.000]   I couldn't wait to compete in 2004, you know?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.480]   So I was older, but I had that hunger.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.460]   And what happened was ironic with Kayla Harrison,
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.680]   you know, when she was world champion 2010,
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.880]   she tried to repeat in 2011.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.880]   Well, all you could see it in her training,
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.240]   you could see it in her competition,
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.680]   the pressure of trying to repeat as world champion
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.760]   was so great, she kind of cracked on,
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.920]   you know, she cracked on the pressure.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.200]   She felt it similar to what I did in Sydney.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.160]   You feel the pressure.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.280]   You don't, you're not sure if you're doing enough.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.200]   You're not sure if you're ready.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.880]   And probably the best thing that ever could have happened
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.840]   to her in 2011 was to lose and finish third.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.400]   Because it set her up.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.780]   And she wasn't the top dog going into London.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.480]   She was one of the favorites,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.140]   but she wasn't ranked number one.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.360]   She was number four.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.040]   And she was an underdog.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.640]   And she wanted to climb back on the top of the podium again.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.240]   So she had, she was hungry again.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.920]   Whereas if she had been a world champion in 2011,
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.040]   she would have never won the Olympics in 2012.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.320]   Never would have happened.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.600]   - What, now you don't have to admit this,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.180]   but have you ever been broken on the mat in competition?
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.680]   For whatever reason, you lost hope or confidence
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.680]   in the match.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.100]   Has there ever been a guy tough enough to have broken you?
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.040]   - I've never been broken in a judo match
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.440]   and I've never quit, ever.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.920]   It's just not my mentality.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.720]   I fought some guys that were tough as nails,
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.240]   you know, that I had to fight for my life against,
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.160]   but I never backed down, never backed down to anybody.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.440]   I might've got beaten, but I went out fighting.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.280]   - Never quit.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.600]   - I never quit ever in a match.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.960]   - So maybe, can you think of anyone in particular
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.360]   who's the toughest guy who ever faced the competition
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.140]   for you personally?
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.140]   - I mean, I had so many tough, tough fights
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.480]   in judo competition.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.520]   I mean, I had some real matches with Udo Qualmals,
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.520]   the German, he was two time world champion,
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.040]   Olympic champion, and Udo and I fought hard,
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.340]   you know, five, six times.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:07.160]   Those were wars that if it was golden score,
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.760]   we might still be fighting today.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.160]   [laughing]
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.000]   You know?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.480]   And there was a Japanese guy, Nakamura,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.200]   Yukimasa Nakamura, he was somebody
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.960]   I never beat in my career.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.760]   Like I never beat that guy.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.760]   He beat me in the semis of the junior worlds,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.920]   he beat me in the semis of the senior worlds,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.880]   beat me at the Kano Cup, he beat me in the finals of France.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.280]   I remember every loss.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.640]   So he was just a very skillful,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.520]   and you know, judo is a lot about matchups.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.160]   If you don't match up well against somebody,
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.040]   then you know, you have a hard time beating them.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.520]   But he was a guy I had a hard time beating.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.900]   So, but I never backed down and I never,
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   you know, nobody ever just ran over me.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.480]   - So I remember I talked to Taraji Williams
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.040]   and he said he was really depressed
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.680]   after his Olympic run, I think second.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.440]   What is that life after the Olympics?
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.880]   Were you haunted by the losses?
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.960]   Is there a depression?
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.840]   Like you will never achieve this kind of high.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.280]   What is that transition into normal life,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.600]   into a life of a coach?
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.840]   - It's really hard.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.880]   And I can tell you, having been to four Olympics,
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.320]   they were all very different.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.160]   My first Olympics that I lost,
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.000]   I won two matches, I lost my third.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.940]   But the three guys that were on the podium
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.340]   were three guys that I had beaten.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.680]   And I'd beat them many times.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.720]   So I felt as if I should have been there.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.400]   And sitting in the stands with my father,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.760]   I remember crying, thinking, I gave up my entire life.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.120]   I sacrificed all those trainings in the gym
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.680]   and all that time overseas and away from home
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.620]   and missed parties and missed this and missed that.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:44.880]   And that's it?
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.980]   It's over?
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.460]   Like three matches, I'm done.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.760]   I didn't do anything in the Olympics, I failed.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.920]   I felt like crap.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.860]   It was depressing.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.260]   Luckily, I was young enough and stupid enough
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.440]   that I wanted to try again.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.540]   - Go meet again, yeah.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.800]   - Winning in Atlanta was fabulous.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.440]   Winning in America and walking around town
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.780]   and have everybody treat you like a hero
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.960]   and welcome you into their store or their restaurant
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.440]   or their bar or whatever it was
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.560]   and show your medal and take pictures.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.060]   You were a rock star in Atlanta and it was awesome.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.360]   But when you come home, you get tugged
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.320]   in a million directions by a million people
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.620]   that want your time.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.000]   So what ends up happening is you start doing everything
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.080]   for everybody else.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.820]   Hey, can you show up to this kid's thing
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.920]   and talk at the school or can you come to this appearance
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.740]   and sign autographs?
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.840]   And you find that your time is all about giving
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.320]   other people your time and you don't really
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.240]   ultimately enjoy it anymore because you could see
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.440]   how sometimes stars just feel like they never have
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.280]   a sense of themselves.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.100]   - It's a curse of celebrity, really.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.400]   - Right, you never have a sense for yourself
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.840]   or peace for yourself.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.000]   When you never do anything for yourself,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.680]   it's always about other people.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.240]   So that becomes hard.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.280]   But it comes with the, I'll take the win every day
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.360]   of the week over not, right?
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.840]   So then Sydney was devastating.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.320]   Losing in Sydney was the worst ever.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.200]   It really was a dark--
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.020]   - And you retired.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.860]   - And I retired.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.560]   So I felt like a failure and I felt like,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.600]   fifth place in the Olympic Games for me
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.640]   was a total failure considering I was supposed
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.480]   to win the Olympics.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.440]   So that was a hard one to swallow
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.280]   and that's why I couldn't ever swallow it forever.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.620]   I needed the fight again.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.080]   But yeah, I could see how somebody like a Taraji
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.960]   who didn't medal in the Olympics, who pursued it
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.500]   as long as he did and made two Olympic teams,
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.480]   as great as everybody else sees that feat,
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.380]   as an athlete, when you have your sights set
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.460]   on achieving excellence and you don't,
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.240]   you definitely feel unfulfilled.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.900]   And you could see that, like I said, in sport,
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.640]   you really don't get that same sense of elation
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.140]   from anything else in life.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.980]   I ran a marathon.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.420]   And I ran the Boston Marathon one time.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.640]   And when I got done, people were like,
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.580]   "Oh my God, that must have felt awesome."
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.200]   I said, "No, I couldn't wait to go home.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.240]   "I was tired.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.040]   "I just wanted to lay down and eat."
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.420]   "Well, wasn't that the greatest feeling in your world?"
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.660]   I'm like, "No."
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.500]   "Would you do it again?"
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.720]   I said, "No, why would I do it again?
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.500]   "I already did it once."
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.580]   But most people, for them,
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.900]   it's such a massive accomplishment.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.140]   For me, it was just, "Okay, I did it.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.220]   "I'm done, move on."
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:25.180]   Childbirth, I hear people say childbirth is awesome.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.540]   And it is, it's different.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.740]   It's a sense of, but it's a different feeling
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.100]   than what you get from winning.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.420]   And the only thing that has ever come close
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.740]   to me doing it was when Kayla won.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.380]   It was being a part of something,
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.620]   and I believe that was destiny,
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.120]   that she came here for a specific purpose,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.620]   some higher being stuck her in this dojo.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.020]   And the reason why I didn't win in Sydney
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.180]   is 'cause that girl was supposed to win in London.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.840]   And we were supposed to help her on that journey,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.700]   my father and myself,
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.700]   that we were supposed to be a part of that.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.900]   And that was the magic moment.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.100]   - It's an amazing chain of events
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.740]   that it feels like it leads up to, yeah, to--
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.540]   - And to me, I believe in that destiny,
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.380]   and I believe in karma and good things, so.
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.440]   - And a repeat in 2016.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.540]   - Let's hope, let's hope.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.340]   It's setting up nicely.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.740]   - So in the United States,
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.460]   a country where judo has struggled to gain ground
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.820]   over the years, over wrestling, jujitsu,
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.980]   compared to other nations in the world,
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.820]   you have produced almost all, if not all,
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.900]   of the US medalists at Worlds and Olympics
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.820]   in the last two decades.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.700]   What is your secret?
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:42.340]   What is the system that you follow?
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.740]   Let's say, how do you take a six-year-old,
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.240]   maybe not a six-year-old, but let's say a six-year-old,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.020]   with an interest in judo and give them a shot
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.020]   at the Olympics medal stand by the time they're 22?
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.540]   What is the process you follow to make so many champions?
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.380]   - Well, first and foremost, there is a system.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.100]   And that's the thing that most other places
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.620]   in America don't have.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.820]   And that's really the problem with the entire USA judo,
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.300]   is that we don't have a system
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.380]   to produce high-level athletes.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.580]   We've done it here in Boston.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.980]   And I was part of this elite under-23 program
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.060]   where we took the 20 most talented kids in the country.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:30.060]   And of that crop came Marty Malloy, Travis Stevens,
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.860]   Kayla Harrison, Nick Del Popolo.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.220]   They were part of that U23 program
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.860]   that I was a part of for six years.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.500]   So that was also my system.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.860]   And really, it's obviously, to be great,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.580]   you gotta be willing to work, right?
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.060]   You have to be willing to put in the hours
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.060]   and you gotta be willing to take the punishment.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.940]   So it's a mentality.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.060]   Number one, it's a championship mindset you have to have.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.920]   Second, you gotta know how to train.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.940]   And we believe in a system of conditioning.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.940]   We believe in grip fighting.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.740]   We believe in Newaza.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.140]   And we're big into strategy.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.060]   So we know that we cannot beat the Russians.
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.100]   We cannot beat the French.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.180]   We cannot beat the Brazilians.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.660]   We cannot beat the Japanese
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.280]   by doing more judo than they do,
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.900]   because it's impossible. - Theoretically, yeah.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.620]   - Right, we can't beat them with judo,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.540]   'cause they have way more people to train with, right?
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.660]   Way more opportunity.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.420]   So we have to beat them with physicality,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.300]   technical strategy, gripping,
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.860]   Newaza, conditioning, toughness,
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.940]   in a mindset that we're gonna win.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.100]   And this is how we're gonna win.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.960]   And you gotta get your students to believe in that system
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.740]   that, okay, we're doing all,
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.460]   and the way we train, we train very intense.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.620]   When I go to Russia or Japan,
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.940]   there's, well, two different things.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.460]   Russia's a lot of drilling, a lot of technique,
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.900]   a lot of free motion and free feel,
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.100]   and not a lot of randori, right?
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.320]   When you go to Japan, it's the opposite.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.620]   It's all randori. - Really, randori heavy, wow.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.700]   - They all do tons of,
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.920]   they do 15 rounds of randori a day in Japan.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.760]   It's insane.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.180]   In Russia, they're lucky if they do 15 in a month, right?
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.260]   It's 'cause it's very technical.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.220]   But two different schools of thought.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.540]   We do really intense, focused training here.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.900]   And we're smart with the periodization of our athletes.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.620]   - Yeah, so you've mentioned that you believe in
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.060]   the idea of peak peaking. - Peak performance.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.880]   - So what is, is it essential to cycle?
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.280]   - It is. - Why can't you be
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.660]   your 100% year-round?
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.880]   - Because-- - Is it a mental aspect?
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.200]   - Physically, you can't be, and mentally, you can't be.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.320]   You need to have times of relaxation,
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.880]   and you need to have times of focused training.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.080]   And actually, as I tried to teach this just recently
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.600]   to my 16-year-old boy who was trying
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   to be the best in wrestling.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.000]   I said, "Son, you can't go 365 days a year
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.200]   "banging your head against the wall and not enjoying life
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.320]   "because in the end, you'll be like this.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.420]   "You'll be great, and you'll be here,
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.400]   "but you'll never have that performance of a lifetime
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   "that you need to have, and you need to have this.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.680]   "You need to have the time where you're not at this level,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.160]   "but you're at this level."
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.820]   Your body needs time to heal.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.160]   Your muscles need time to heal and rest.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.280]   Your mind needs time to heal and rest.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.820]   In order to have, otherwise, it gets used to being,
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.740]   it gets used to being right here all the time in this zone.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.560]   We wanna have a zone where it's above that,
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.880]   and that's what's Olympic champion.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.380]   That's what world champion is.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:38.080]   But in order to have that, you gotta let your body come down
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.760]   so that it can build from somewhere.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.880]   So you see that a lot,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.440]   boxers are actually pretty good at that.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.660]   I mean, they take it to an extreme
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.900]   where they get so fat and so out of shape,
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.040]   then it's their training camp
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.340]   for 12 weeks or 16 weeks, right?
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.760]   But that's the idea is that I'm not training now.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   I'm relaxing, I'm having fun so that I can focus
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.520]   when it's time to focus and get real serious about this,
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.400]   and I can push my body to limits that I otherwise wouldn't.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.360]   And that's what we believe in.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.960]   - You've mentioned your father, Jim Pager, Sr.,
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.200]   is a big part of the club.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   What role does he play as part of the system?
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.840]   - He's a huge part of the system.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.680]   You ask any of the athletes, he gives his time.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.680]   I work full-time, I have four children.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.720]   So judo's never gonna make me rich.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.560]   - Yes.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.640]   - So my life as a judoka has helped me
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   become pretty wealthy
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.320]   because of being involved in martial arts.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.680]   So I'm able to, I just started a brand new mat company,
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.080]   the Fuji Mat Company, just started that.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.120]   I've been involved in selling Fuji
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.680]   and Harashita sports goods for the last year or so.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.600]   So I've been able to make my life
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.280]   through martial arts and judo,
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.060]   but the sport of judo is not what puts food
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.800]   on my kid's table.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.000]   So in order for these athletes to become great,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.640]   they need to train more than once a day.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.400]   So my dad is down here with the,
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.640]   every single morning he runs a morning
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.800]   technical training session for all of our elite guys.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.120]   - Yeah, can you actually describe,
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.520]   at least in broad strokes,
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.860]   what a weekly program looks like
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.720]   for an elite level judoka?
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.600]   - Sure.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.520]   So our athletes train Monday,
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.680]   Monday morning they train here judo, technical session.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.840]   It's about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.080]   of technical training.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.240]   - What do you mean by technical training?
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.800]   So it's like drilling, throws, and narandori?
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.840]   - Sometimes, depends on how many bodies we have
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.780]   and depends on who's in town training.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.840]   But for the most part, it's mostly drills,
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.240]   gripping drills, nawaza drills,
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:45.400]   throwing, throwing drills, three man uchi komis,
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.280]   speed drills, sprints in the morning
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.520]   at the end of practice, some conditioning.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.440]   But they're training for an hour to an hour
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.640]   and 15 minutes every morning.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.000]   When they leave here,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.920]   they then go to a professional strength coach.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.160]   Some of them go to Mike Boyle's
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.600]   Strength and Conditioning in Woburn.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.880]   Some of them go to the place I went with Paul Soussi,
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.700]   one-to-one strength training in North Andover.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.800]   But after they work out here, they have a break,
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.280]   they go eat, then mid-afternoon,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.240]   they're at a strength training place.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.180]   Judo-specific strength training.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.560]   It's not power lifting, it's some type of circuit training.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.960]   Again, it depends on what type of time of year it is
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.240]   and what phase of training we're in,
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.040]   what type of lifting they're doing.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:28.880]   So it depends.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.000]   But they're doing something focused for, again,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.600]   between an hour, an hour and a half
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.200]   with stretching and everything else built in,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.520]   an hour, an hour and a half of afternoon.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.240]   Then they come back at night
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.840]   and they'll train rendori at night.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.620]   We do another hour and a half rendori session at night.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:51.120]   So they're minimally doing three trainings almost every day.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.760]   They go Monday like that, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.640]   Thursday, they have the morning off.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.600]   So they just do weight training and judo.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.480]   And then Friday morning only, they train.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.800]   - And then Saturday, Sunday off?
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.920]   - Saturday depends on the weightlifting schedule they're on.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.920]   Like a Friday, they only have one training.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.680]   And Saturday, they normally have one training,
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.520]   a weight training.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.760]   But they get Saturday night off and Sunday off.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.100]   - Beautiful, okay.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.420]   - Unless we're fighting in a tournament,
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.440]   then they have to go to the tournament on the weekend.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.160]   (laughing)
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.240]   - What has been the biggest challenge for you
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.760]   in preparing for the 2016 Olympics in Rio?
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.840]   Preparing the team.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.060]   - For me, personally, it's been balancing family with team.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.280]   My wife's been at this for a long time, right?
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.120]   So she's been helping since 1992.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.840]   She's been living with me going to the Olympics.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.320]   So after the 2012 Olympics,
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.080]   it really took a hard toll on my family
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.040]   'cause I had to travel so much.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.560]   So I took a break after 2012 and I've been home a lot
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.080]   and I've been focusing on the family.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.320]   I have a daughter that's six.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.200]   I have three teenagers that give mom hell at home
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.040]   when I'm away.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.760]   So I've been really focusing on family.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.440]   So that's why it's been hard for me to balance
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.380]   because I love judo, I love the sport,
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.080]   I love helping the athletes, I love being in the game.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.120]   And I genuinely feel that the athletes benefit
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.120]   with having me in their chair and with them
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.720]   and it inspires them
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.640]   and I think it gives them a lot of confidence.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.960]   But so that's been the challenge for me is balancing both.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.560]   But now that the Olympics is ramping up again here
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.240]   and we're just about to turn 2015,
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.400]   there's gonna be a lot more traveling
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.960]   to come in with the team.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.840]   But my dad's picked up, I've put my dad in that role
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.720]   because the best two athletes in our country
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.480]   are Kayla Harrison and Travis Stevens.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.840]   So they're from our territory, they're from our home club.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.440]   So my dad is their coach and I'm their coach.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.800]   So if they can't have me, they have the next best thing
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.860]   and that's my dad.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:58.920]   - What is the most painful moment you remember,
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.900]   maybe one that stands out as a coach?
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.520]   - Watching Travis Stevens lose at the semifinal match
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.840]   at the Olympic Games unquestionably as a coach
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.680]   was the most painful moment I've ever been involved in
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.200]   because I see how hard the boy works.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.280]   I see how much he wants it.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.720]   I see how much he sacrifices.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.480]   He's a kid who doesn't drink alcohol.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.760]   He's straight as an arrow.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.600]   - Yeah.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.320]   - And when I gave you that schedule
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.920]   of three times a day training,
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.520]   he's out there right now doing jujitsu.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.640]   So he trains four to five times a day.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.200]   Like he's a mat rat.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.280]   You know, he wants it.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.320]   - And when he's hurt, he pushes through.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.880]   - Yeah, he's a tough kid.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.400]   So I felt really bad for him
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.920]   because you don't really get those moments back in life
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.880]   where you're in the semifinals of the Olympic Games.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.040]   In fact, he may never get that moment back.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.320]   We hope he does,
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.240]   but that was flip of a coin who wins the fight.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.200]   And if it goes his way,
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.840]   he's a silver medalist or a gold medalist in the Olympics.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   You know?
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.920]   So that was really painful.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.560]   And I watched him cry on the sideline
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.720]   for an hour after that.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.120]   And then he had to fight for a bronze
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.480]   and normally nine times out of 10,
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.760]   he'll beat that Canadian.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.040]   You know, he beat the boy before the Olympics
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.000]   many, many times.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.240]   It's just, he had physically drained his body
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.600]   of all emotion.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.520]   He had nothing left for the bronze fight.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.560]   So.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.720]   - So you're a coach now,
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.800]   but you're also in forever judoka.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.640]   So how's the Jimmy Pedro of today
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.400]   different from the guy who won bronze in 2004?
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.400]   In terms of how has your judo developed?
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.800]   How you think, technically, how you think about judo,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.040]   how you approach judo?
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.040]   How you teach judo?
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   - Well, I try to,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:47.640]   I take a lot of what I learned in my career
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.360]   and I pass it on to my students.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.120]   Nobody ever, I really had nobody that gave that to me.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.960]   - Right.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.440]   - So there's a mental side of this game
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.480]   that I learned and I trained my mind.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.600]   I visualized success myself.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.520]   I had some good self-talk
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.720]   that I did with myself all the time.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.880]   I've passed all of that onto my students,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.920]   how to use their mind to achieve success,
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.160]   how to see it, how to believe it.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.720]   Even before they do it, they have to believe it
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.280]   and they have to see it.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.080]   And I'm a firm believer that if you create that pathway
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   in your mind enough times,
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.960]   what happens is when the moment comes for it to happen,
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.240]   your body thinks it's been there before
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.520]   and that's where it's supposed to go.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.840]   So it'll go.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.680]   - Yeah.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.520]   - And most people, they never see it happen.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.080]   They only, oh, I hope I wanna be
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.640]   an Olympic champion someday.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.960]   But they never really see it, believe it,
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.840]   experience it before it happens
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.760]   and therefore it never will
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.000]   because they don't think it's possible.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:51.840]   So I--
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.480]   - Kayla talked about that that is something you taught her
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.640]   and then she just felt like at the Olympics,
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.600]   she felt like it's almost like you're an autopilot.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.280]   It's an obvious fact that she's getting the gold.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.320]   She's almost walking through the--
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.160]   - Right.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.600]   - And she's visualized a million times.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.800]   - So I was able to pass that on.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.960]   And they say sports is like 90% mental, right?
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.800]   I mean, because if it was just training,
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.560]   everybody would train 365 days a year, right?
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.280]   24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.120]   That's it.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.600]   It's just whoever trains the most, but it's not.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.320]   We all do the physical stuff,
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.920]   but not everybody does that mental stuff.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.280]   And I really, as a coach, focus on that side of the game
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.400]   as well as the strategy and looking at videos
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.080]   and studying how to beat this opponent
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.560]   and what our objectives are in this match.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.400]   And I think that also, rather than just walk out blindly
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:44.960]   and just fight, you've gotta have a strategy going in.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.840]   So I think taking that professional approach to the game
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.520]   and with our system, if you look at the number of people
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.080]   we have in this dojo in terms of elite athletes
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.800]   and the number of bodies we have to train with,
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.080]   there's gotta be doing something right, right?
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.040]   Because we're competing with Japan and Russia
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.800]   and France and everywhere else with what we have,
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.760]   and we don't have very much money either.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.320]   So we're up against all odds,
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.440]   yet we're still getting it done.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.240]   So I'd say, how is it different?
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.680]   I think I'm a little bit more cerebral as a coach
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.560]   than I was as an athlete,
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.360]   because I had to learn a lot of it on my own
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.920]   when I was a player.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.300]   - So last topic, one that gets a lot of talk,
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.280]   but in the last half decade,
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.040]   the IJF, the International Judo Federation,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.440]   has made a lot of rule changes,
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   starting from banning leg grabs.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.040]   Can you summarize the rule changes
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.440]   and say whether you think they have had
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.600]   an overall positive or negative effect on judo?
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   - The IJF's goal was to differentiate judo from wrestling.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.960]   They really wanted to differentiate the two sports
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.800]   so that in case the Olympic Committee said,
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   "You know what, we need to get rid of another sport.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.880]   "Which sport are we gonna get rid of?"
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.760]   Well, wrestling and judo are kind of the same.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.760]   They're very similar.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.560]   Why don't we just get rid of one of them?
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.400]   So they really wanted to differentiate itself
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.240]   from wrestling.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.920]   - That was before they threatened wrestling.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.280]   - Before they almost chucked wrestling, right.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.640]   So that was one reason.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.320]   Second is they tried to make it
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.640]   a little bit more fan-friendly.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.720]   So, man, how much time is spent gripping
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.840]   and ripping and gripping?
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.720]   So they've taken a lot of the gripping rules
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.960]   out of the game and you're not allowed
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.720]   to break grips so many times anymore.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.200]   And they thought that was a boring element of judo.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.440]   But the reality of the situation is that judo's
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.120]   never going to be a fan-friendly live sport.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:43.960]   It just isn't.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.280]   It's never gonna be.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.040]   And if you're not a judoka and you don't have an interest
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.680]   in who's fighting, it's boring.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.880]   Judo can be very spectacular if you create a story
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.120]   behind it and you do a one-hour show
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.440]   where you're only showing highlights of,
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.600]   and behind the scenes, and who is this athlete,
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.560]   and get to know him, and get the people to know who he is,
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.240]   and then show his series of fights,
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.080]   and show his throws or submissions,
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.400]   and pump him up to watch the final.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.440]   And then when the final happens,
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.360]   just show the best clips of the final
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.200]   and have some commentary going about what's going on.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.320]   Then it can be a good sport.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.000]   But it'll never be a good live sport
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.160]   because it's very boring.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.640]   And it always will be.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.760]   No matter what rules you put in.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.440]   I love wrestling.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.840]   But wrestling, if you don't know who is wrestling,
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.680]   it's boring.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.520]   - Yeah.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.720]   - You don't, and it's, and same with--
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.920]   - Especially at the elite level.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.440]   - Same with American football, though.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.840]   If you truly, all the Europeans say,
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.800]   "Football's so boring.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.600]   "You start, you stop, you start, you stop.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.040]   "I don't get it."
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.760]   And because they don't have an interest in any team,
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.480]   they don't care who wins.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.680]   They're not from New England rooting for the Patriots.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.280]   Say, when we watch soccer as Americans, it's boring.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.040]   We're not rooting for any team.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.160]   - So it's really the story that people fall in love with
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.000]   in football and everything.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.120]   - Or it's the team.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.040]   - Like, yeah, they know the players.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.240]   They know, they have a close connection with the people.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.040]   - You gotta be into the game to enjoy it.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.160]   So no fan who has never done judo
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.160]   is ever going to enjoy watching judo,
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.320]   unless it's a highlight reel and they're like,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.960]   "Oh, geez, oh."
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.520]   And they see the cool stuff going on.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.280]   So I think all the rule changes are for not.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.000]   I don't think they're affecting,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.960]   they're not gonna affect the popularity of the sport.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.000]   Unquestionably, they're not gonna affect.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.320]   I go to all of these big Grand Slam tournaments in Abu Dhabi
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.040]   and there's nobody in the stands.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.680]   You go to all these tournaments
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.160]   and there's nobody watching.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.000]   Everybody's watching online, but nobody's watching.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.480]   So I think the rule changes, to be honest with you,
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.100]   I think it's gotten more towards sport.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.800]   It's less towards, if you think about
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.040]   what judo was founded on,
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.000]   it was founded on sport, the Olympic sport.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.440]   It was founded on self-defense, right?
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.400]   As an element of the sport.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.480]   Judo has no self-defense element whatsoever anymore.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.640]   It's all about sport.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.820]   No dojos really teach self-defense element of judo.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.840]   And what are leg grabs?
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.360]   Really, leg grabs are self-defense.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.080]   If some guy attacks me with his legs,
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.280]   I'm grabbing his leg, right?
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.440]   So they've taken that out of it.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.160]   And even as a judo player who's in the sport,
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.640]   some guy who's very six foot one,
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.320]   and I'm five foot five, he's got really long legs.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.960]   So if he comes in high, I should be able to grab it.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.540]   So you're taking that part of the sport,
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.740]   so I disagree with that.
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:35.000]   And then the kata, the prearranged movements.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.800]   Nobody does that anymore, really, anyway.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.360]   So judo's lost a lot of its,
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.440]   well, it's basically come down
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.920]   to just being an Olympic sport these days,
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:47.080]   which is impractical for the masses
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.960]   because the masses are never gonna compete in the sport.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.800]   It's too dangerous.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.440]   It's too physical.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.000]   So if you, like jujitsu succeeded
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.300]   because it's taken it to a safe place.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.000]   It's taken it to the ground.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.120]   Nobody's tumbling and falling and doing 360s,
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.520]   and they're rolling.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.880]   They're getting a good workout.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.880]   They're learning some self-defense, right?
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.320]   You can be 80 years old and--
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.800]   But it's safe, right?
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.880]   But that's okay.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.920]   That's what, if you wanna make the sport popular,
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.280]   everybody has to be able to do it.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.840]   And right now, judo has become a sport
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.140]   that only the young can do.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.320]   That's why I think it's failing.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.320]   - The question is, judo got into the Olympics in '64, 1964.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.340]   That's exactly 50 years ago.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:36.920]   So martial arts in general have gone a long way
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   in the last 50 years, thanks to the Olympics.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.560]   And even, I think very importantly,
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.120]   thanks to mixed martial arts,
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.640]   where they kind of put like sumo and karate
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.920]   and all of these things together.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.280]   And you realize that the grappling arts
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.880]   have a lot to contribute to.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.640]   This is a really effective art, an exciting art.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.280]   So where do you think judo will be,
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.340]   this is a weird question, but 50 years from now?
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:07.260]   So do you think there's something timeless
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:09.900]   in terms of value in the sport of judo?
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:16.560]   - Judo's trying to become more professional, right?
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.760]   But it's also becoming a very expensive sport.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.960]   So what I see happening over the course of time
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.840]   is all of the big programs are gonna continue to be big
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.400]   in the sport of judo because they're invested--
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.520]   - Across the world. - Yes.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.360]   So only the big programs though.
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.880]   So what's gonna happen is, like right now,
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.440]   they have a cadet circuit.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.820]   So kids 14 to 18 years old,
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.520]   they can get on a world ranking list
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.720]   and there's a cadet circuit
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.960]   that they compete against other cadets.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.880]   Then there's a junior circuit,
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.480]   that's up to 21 years old
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:50.200]   and all these juniors have world rankings
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.820]   and there's a junior competitions all over the world
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.320]   to develop those athletes.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.120]   And then there's a senior circuit.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.200]   The problem is the big countries,
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.640]   like a Japan and a Brazil and a France and a Russia,
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.820]   in a lot of the European countries,
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:09.080]   they have the budgets and they're investing in their youth
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   to ultimately run from cadet to junior to senior.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:17.340]   So they're gonna continue to flourish as countries
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.100]   and get stronger and invest more money and grow.
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.260]   All of the other countries, including America,
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.780]   who don't have money,
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.140]   we don't invest any money right now at all
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.300]   in our junior program.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.740]   Not even, forget our cadets.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:35.820]   Our cadets, their parents have to pay US judo
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.220]   just to have their kids do judo.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:40.260]   But we invest nothing in our juniors
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.900]   'cause we don't have the budget for it.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:44.220]   So all we focus on is the elite side
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:47.180]   and it's becoming more and more expensive
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:51.540]   to fund these athletes to qualify for the Olympics.
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.260]   Soon as you shut off that opportunity
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.660]   for us to qualify for the Olympics,
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.420]   judo's gone in America.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.060]   It'll be non-existent.
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.360]   Okay, so and that's the direction we're headed.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.980]   We have less elite athletes today in America
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.340]   than we did four years ago,
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.900]   than we did eight years ago,
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.620]   than we did back in the '70s.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.940]   There's less elite players today than there was then.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.120]   So judo continues to shrink.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.000]   The more expensive it becomes,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   I don't even see countries like Peru
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.060]   and a lot of the South American countries,
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.140]   Argentina, Venezuela,
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.460]   they used to have good full teams of athletes.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.300]   Nowadays, the number of athletes
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.600]   that are competing at the World's and Olympics,
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.260]   they're less and less and less and less.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.780]   They have less money to do it.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.960]   They have no budgets.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.140]   They're gonna disappear.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.420]   So what judo's gonna become,
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.760]   it's gonna become a much smaller sport
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.440]   in terms of number of countries that participate
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.080]   because there's not gonna be any programs
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   in any of those other countries
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.760]   that can compete with the rest of the world.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.720]   So 50 years from now,
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.800]   I don't think you'll see,
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.720]   I don't think you'll see anybody from the United States.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:06.200]   - There always could be some renegade club from Boston
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.480]   that proves everybody wrong.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.620]   - I'm gonna tell you, mark my words right now,
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.660]   that if there isn't a drastic change in this country.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.060]   - Or funding from--
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.940]   - That come the 2020 Olympic game,
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:21.420]   you'll be lucky to see two Americans on that team.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:22.260]   Two.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:26.780]   We get one guaranteed 'cause the IJF will give you one.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:29.860]   But you'll be lucky to see two in Tokyo,
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.660]   the direction we're headed.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.200]   'Cause you're gonna lose, Travis.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.220]   You're gonna lose, Marty.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.260]   You're gonna lose, Kayla.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.660]   You're gonna lose, Nick.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.260]   You're gonna lose all your best athletes right now.
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.660]   And I really don't see the pipeline coming up.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:49.140]   - I hope that doesn't come to reality, but.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.520]   - Me either.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.280]   - On that dark note,
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:58.900]   people can find you on jimmypedra.com,
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.660]   on Facebook, where else?
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.860]   - I'm a vice president and a partner in Fuji Sports
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.220]   and the Fuji Mac company.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.980]   So we love your business and love your support.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.340]   We deck out clubs with complete outfitting,
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:16.380]   their gyms with mats and wall pads and all kinds of gear.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.380]   And then obviously the gi and gear.
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.900]   We do custom uniforms for gis and shorts and rash guards
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.820]   and stuff for clubs at fujisports.com.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.220]   - That's the only gi I own is Fuji gis.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.380]   Like I'm moving to California now.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.580]   I have a closet full of like 20 gis I have
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.380]   to figure out what to do with them.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.380]   But.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.060]   - Before we end, I'd like to comment, Lex,
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:45.060]   that I've done considerable amount of interviews in my day.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:48.260]   And through the years, I will say that this is
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:53.260]   the most well thought out, comprehensive, intelligent,
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.660]   thought provoking questions that I've ever been asked
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.540]   in my career.
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.220]   - Thanks, I appreciate that.
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.300]   So I won't, since you said that,
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.940]   I will not hold your comment in the beginning
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.460]   about you choosing the Russian against you.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.060]   So thank you very much for the warm welcome.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.460]   It's been fun.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.420]   Next time I'll come on by Gian.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.660]   - Awesome, you're welcome anytime.
