[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140]   If you can give an across-the-board recommendation of how much protein people should consume
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.240]   post-resistance training, let's just leave cardiovascular training separately for the
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.380]   moment, post-resistance training, what would that number be? Would it be 20, 30, 50, or 100?
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.640]   Should it scale with body weight? And how long after training should one consume that protein
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.780]   if the goal is muscle protein synthesis? To maximize muscle protein synthesis,
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.140]   regardless of whether it's post-exercise, and MPS will be larger with the protein dosing
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.220]   post-exercise than at resting or fasting. To maximize MPS, we really haven't seen doses
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:55.280]   beyond 50-ish grams, 30 or so to 50. My colleague Brad Schoenfeld and I, we scoured the literature
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.420]   and we wrote this paper on what is the maximal anabolic dose of protein per meal for the goal
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.900]   of muscle building. And we boiled it down to somewhere between 0.4 to roughly 0.6 grams per
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:23.620]   kilogram of body weight. And so in freedom units, we're talking 0.2 to 0.25 grams per pound. And that
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.360]   is what appears to max out muscle protein synthesis. 0.2 to 0.5 grams per pound. 0.2 to 0.25.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.660]   0.25. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So like about a quarter of your body weight in pounds, if you're looking at
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.580]   grams of protein to maximize per muscle protein synthesis. Yes. Per meal. Okay. Sorry. Because I
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.080]   think many people, including myself, are going to say, okay, but this is only in the meal post-workout.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.840]   I mean, I wake up in the morning and I try to work out before I eat because I like to do that.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.960]   Sometimes I'll have a little bit of protein, but let's assume two conditions just for simplicity.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:07.580]   Somebody did resistance training in the previous two hours or, and they're trying to evaluate how
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.400]   much protein to eat at that meal in order to maximize muscle protein synthesis, or they're eating a meal
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.280]   separate for, on a day they're not resistance training. Yeah. Right. So, and then as just kind
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   of a, a generic example of a meal that doesn't follow resistance training in a window of two
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.540]   hours or so, how much protein should be consumed at these two different meals? The answer to that
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.780]   is so weird, Andrew, honestly. Really? Why does it have to be so weird? It's freaking weird and
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:48.980]   it's complicated. That's because, okay. So if we go all the way back to 2003, 2004, and then we walk
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.020]   forward 20 years. So John Ivy and Robert Portman put out this book called Nutrient Timing, and they
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.980]   focused on this narrow post-exercise window of opportunity, they called it. So the, the anabolic
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.260]   window. And the concept was you needed to consume protein and quickly digesting carbs. So a fast
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:21.020]   digesting protein, lightning fast, highly glycemic, highly insulinic carb source together within, within 30
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.520]   to 60 minutes post-exercise in order to maximize the anabolic response and maximize recovery and then
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:36.900]   maximize your muscle gain. So that was their hypothesis. This was all based on subjects who
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:47.280]   were training after an overnight fast. And so what happens when you consume a meal pre-exercise or at any
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.420]   point, let's say, a regular old mixed meal, medium size, the anabolic slash anti-catabolic effect of
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.480]   that meal is going to last anywhere from three to six hours, depending on the size of the meal. So when
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.840]   you're somebody whose goal it is, above all the other goals, is to gain muscle at the quickest rate possible,
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.140]   you're almost never going to train fasted. You're going to have a pre-exercise meal at some point, at least
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:23.440]   a couple hours pre-exercise. And so when you're training, you actually still have these substrates
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.100]   in circulation through the exercise bout. And oftentimes, like if somebody has a meal like an hour
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:40.060]   pre-exercise, they're still absorbing that pre-exercise meal post-exercise. So we looked at this whole post-exercise
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:48.240]   period as something that just doesn't necessarily have any external validity. It doesn't have relevance
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.000]   to real world training conditions where people are not training fasted. And so what we did was,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.040]   we did a couple of things. First, we wrote a narrative review criticizing the post-exercise
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.780]   anabolic window. And this was in 2013. We kind of pissed off all the researchers who did the seminal work
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.240]   in that area. I'm sensing a theme here. It's teasing.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.000]   And then we actually, we did a meta-analysis of the existing literature, looking at the anabolic
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.500]   window thing. And for the listeners, a meta-analysis is a study of the studies. You collect all of the
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.320]   studies on a given question, and then you kind of see, you look at effect sizes, and you sort of see
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.840]   where the evidence leans, whether there's a significant or meaningful effect or not. And so
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:41.280]   we did this meta-analysis and we collected studies that compared a protein timing condition where
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.700]   protein was timed within an hour, either pre or post-exercise. And then the control group of the
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.660]   study would have to have protein, a minimum of two hours of nutrient neglect on both sides of the
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:02.240]   training bound. So we collected all the studies that compared these conditions. And we had a brilliant
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.060]   stats guy, James Krieger. He ran the regression analysis. And essentially, we found that as long
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:19.360]   as total daily protein was about 1.66, 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight, so about 0.7 grams per pound,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.160]   as long as total daily protein was at that or more, then the timing relative to the training bout
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.940]   didn't make a difference.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.040]   This is important for people to hear, because what this translates to in my ears is a very simple
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.280]   takeaway, which is that you don't need to obsess about the post-training anabolic window,
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.820]   especially if you're eating prior to training because you have nutrients circulating. Now,
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:55.300]   if you eat your last bite of food at 8 p.m. and you wake up at 7 a.m. and you're training at 10 a.m.,
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.220]   then perhaps by the time you finish your leg workout or whatever resistance training workout,
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.280]   you would want to prioritize getting some protein and other nutrients into your system. What you're
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.680]   saying, basically, it's so logical now that I hear it, which is that you have nutrients circulating in
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.600]   your body and stored in your glycogen, and so you're pulling from a reservoir. Fasted doesn't
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.140]   necessarily mean starving. General rule of thumb, if you're burping your pre-exercise meal towards the
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.680]   end of your workout, then you don't need to run towards this. This is why I don't like to ingest
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.180]   anything prior to training besides caffeine, electrolytes, and water. The reason why there's
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.680]   a weird and complex answer where this is like a single resistance training bout causes this
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:49.960]   sort of, you know, this interesting cascade of things where muscle protein synthesis will peak 24 hours
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:58.240]   after the resistance training bout. And it'll take as long as 48 to 72 hours to kind of come down
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:06.680]   to baseline levels to where you had not done the resistance training bout. So the anabolic window
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:17.400]   is actually not hours, but days. So it's more a matter of making sure you are consuming. Well,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.660]   the first in the order of importance is total daily protein. So there's this hierarchy of importance.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:29.500]   If you get total daily protein right, then the timing of the constituent doses of the total
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:35.600]   are just a distant secondary concern. Even if it's only distributed across two meals,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.960]   like let's say, um, I train in the morning, maybe I have a, uh, some caffeine and a scoop of a,
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.280]   you know, protein shake before like with some whey protein, maybe a few almonds to, you know,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:54.340]   slow digestion down or whatever, um, train. And then I don't get to eat until 3 PM and I only train
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.800]   for an hour, let's say, and then at 3 PM, I have a little bit of a chicken breast and a salad,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.040]   maybe a slice of bread because I'm, I'm on the fly. And then that night I get home and I'm hungry
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.740]   and I eat two ribeye steaks. I'm exaggerating here. I wouldn't do that. I'd like to, but I don't.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:15.920]   Those two ribeye steaks probably give you 75 or even a hundred grams of protein and a bunch of
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.160]   other things too. Can you use all of that for muscle protein synthesis?
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.460]   The short answer is yes. Um, the nuanced answer is, let me tell you about a couple studies.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.040]   Okay. Well, as you do that, but, but let me ask you a little differently, not to,
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.460]   not to shut down the, the, the emphasis on studies, cause that's why you're here. But
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:46.280]   is there anything wrong with consuming high or very high protein meal every once in a while,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:53.020]   especially if you're not eating much or consuming much protein throughout the day. And the reason I
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:59.080]   ask this is for practical reasons. Many people find it difficult to distribute their protein evenly
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:06.860]   through the day. Many people also find it difficult to get enough protein in the middle of the day meals
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.340]   or the morning meals. It can be done. And I know people will say, well, you have some eggs and some
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.740]   protein. There are ways to do it. Sure. But at least in this country, most people tend to emphasize
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:22.940]   dinner as their largest meal for better or worse. And you can usually order high quality, high protein
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:29.540]   foods in a restaurant, like a steak, chicken breast, fish, et cetera. So a lot of people stack their protein
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.320]   heavily towards the end of the day. Sure. Assuming caloric load is appropriate, et cetera. Is there
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.120]   anything fundamentally wrong or bad about doing that from the perspective of body composition
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:48.960]   and health? I would say no. Um, and then there's levels to it, right? Um, like what population are
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.000]   we looking at? Are we looking at guys who are trying to win a national competition in bodybuilding,
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:02.720]   for example? No, we're talking about men and women, um, teens up to 75 years old who are trying
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.860]   to be fit by doing a combination of resistance training and hopefully some cardiovascular training
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.840]   as well, trying to get their steps in. We're talking about the general population, not somebody who's
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:22.300]   trying to win a physique competition or run a marathon or ultra. Okay. So generally, no. And I want to
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:31.500]   qualify that a little bit. So my colleagues and I did a study testing out this anabolic window thing.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:39.260]   This was 2014 where we tested immediate pre-exercise 25 grams of whey protein versus immediate post-exercise
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:48.820]   25 grams of whey protein. Uh, we ran the experiment for 10 weeks. Yeah. 10 weeks. Yep. Eight or 10,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:57.720]   probably 10. Um, and there was no significant advantage of either, um, condition. So, and our
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.100]   thinking was, look, everybody's harping about this post-exercise anabolic window. So it really,
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:09.160]   if there is this opportunity to consume nutrients at prime time to feed the hungry muscles, then you
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:16.680]   would want to focus on availability of nutrients in circulation and not when you actually consume the
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.900]   nutrients because there's this time course for them to, for the nutrients to peak in circulation. It's
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.960]   usually somewhere between one and two hours after you ingest the stuff. So how about we consume
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.020]   protein immediately pre, and then it'll be peaking in the blood like an hour ish later, and then you'll
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:38.620]   be right in the anabolic window. So we didn't see any advantage to the immediate pre-protein versus the
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:47.700]   immediate post-protein. That was in 2014. So fast forward to 2024 ish, 23, 24. Uh, one of my colleagues,
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:57.840]   Yasin Locke, he took our, our pre-post model and he kind of like, he ran his own, uh, randomized control
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:05.280]   trial version of it, but he wanted to kind of exploit the possibility of further protein neglect on both sides
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:12.680]   of the training bout. So he compared an immediate pre, um, and post immediate pre and post 25 grams of
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:20.440]   protein sandwiching the resistance training bout with a group that neglected all, all nutrients for three
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   hours on both sides of the resistance training bout. Total daily protein was optimized at around, uh, close to a
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.980]   gram per pound, two, two ish grams per kilogram of body weight. No significant difference, no meaningful
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:40.660]   difference in muscle size and strength gains at the end of the, I believe it was a 10 or 12 week study.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:47.840]   That's very reassuring to me. I mean, because I have a busy schedule as do many people. And sometimes I'm a
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.600]   little hungry before I train and I'll want a scoop of protein powder and I'll think, Oh, is it better?
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.040]   We'll talk about whether or not it's better to train fasted, uh, for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.220]   people don't like to train fasted. Sometimes people don't like to eat immediately after they train.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.940]   Sometimes you have to shower up and head to dinner after you train or shower up and head to a meeting
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:16.160]   and you don't have the opportunity to ingest this in the quote unquote anabolic window. So what I'm
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.180]   hearing through all these answers, correct me if I'm wrong, is that there's tremendous flexibility
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:27.760]   as to when you consume the protein that we all need, but that it, the overall protein requirement
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.680]   seems to center somewhere around 0.7 to one gram per pound of body weight, somewhere in their total
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:42.020]   per day. If the amount in a given meal is a bit higher than 20 or 30 grams, you're fine. If it's a bit
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.880]   lower, you're probably fine. But the thing that also I believe needs highlighting that most people
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.940]   don't talk about is distinguishing between what's in circulation versus when one ingests something.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.660]   Like we'd love to think that we drink 30 grams of protein or eat the chicken breast or the piece
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:05.240]   of steak or have the eggs and suddenly those amino acids are available. And it makes so much more
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.460]   rational sense now that you describe it, that eating first makes those amino acids available
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:17.800]   for the muscles a couple hours later. And we just don't learn about it that way. So I'm very grateful
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.520]   that you're bringing it up that way. I realized we could probably drill into protein requirements
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:29.960]   ad nauseum, but- Think about it this way. The way I like to put it is total daily protein is the cake.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:37.160]   The specific timing of protein relative to the training bout, that is the icing on the cake. And it's a very
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:46.820]   very thin layer of icing on the cake.
