[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.340]   - We open the week with a pretty raw email
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.480]   from a hurting man, a hurting dad.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480]   He's sad over the brokenness of this world
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.120]   and that brokenness hits home for him very closely.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.800]   Here's his story sent in as an anonymous email.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.920]   Dear Pastor John, to be totally truthful
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.580]   and honest with you, I struggle to believe
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.400]   the Lord is completely ruling his world today.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.720]   It's impossible to believe simply
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.200]   because of the state of the world.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.800]   Or should I say his world today?
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.840]   Not only has our nation gone down a slippery road
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.560]   of immoral self-destruction, but our economy is faltering.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.440]   National debt is skyrocketing.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.880]   The unborn are massacred daily.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.540]   Murder rates in America are swelling.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.560]   In Chicago, the crime rate has escalated
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.320]   to such a high degree that I'm beginning
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920]   to believe it's safer in Iraq or Afghanistan
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.820]   than it is in the South Side.
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.440]   Most children sleep under their beds
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.560]   in fear that they may become victims of gun violence.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.320]   Struggles hit home for us too.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.680]   A family of four, we have a son born with ADHD
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.280]   and this has created a life of pure frustration,
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.700]   pain, sorrow, and sometimes even despair.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.560]   One night while attempting to do his schoolwork
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.160]   across the kitchen table, he told me,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.900]   "Dad, I hate going to school.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.120]   "Even the teachers make fun of me.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.720]   "I hate ADHD and this medication
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.560]   "that makes me sick to my stomach."
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.920]   Pastor John, if God is in charge,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.120]   why is there so much suffering all around?
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.360]   - Well, the most grievous thing this dear man says
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   is it is impossible to believe.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.520]   And so I've been praying, I pray now
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   that God might perhaps use something, I say,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.920]   to make it possible again.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.200]   We've tried to address this question many times
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.880]   at Desiring God and at Pastor John.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.440]   But when I saw the question,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.800]   I thought I really do want to address this.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.080]   Again, because I feel the gut-wrenching pressure
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.000]   of the problem, not just because of the way
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.700]   this man so effectively articulated it,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.560]   but also because a while back,
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.440]   Noelle and I watched a three-part documentary
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   called "Pain, Puss, and Poison."
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.400]   And in the second episode about the history
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.840]   leading up to the discovery of penicillin
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   and the emergence of antibiotics in the 20th century,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.600]   I was almost overwhelmed with the thought
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.360]   of how many thousands of years
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.040]   the world languished horribly
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.920]   under the most horrific diseases
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.320]   with no medical defense whatsoever,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.480]   and in fact, with medical procedures
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.280]   that often made matters worse.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   For example, the night before George Washington died,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.880]   they bled four pints of blood from his body.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.040]   Four pints, that's almost 40% of his blood.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.680]   That second episode showed pictures
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.120]   of people dying of horrible open infections
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.080]   and little children covered with smallpox sores
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   as I watched their mothers fanning the flies off of them,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.780]   just waiting for their children to die.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.320]   And when I saw them, my wife looked away,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.560]   she couldn't look, and I just felt myself gasping,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.400]   saying, "No, what if I were there?
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.600]   "What if I were the parent fanning
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.440]   "this horribly deformed child,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.080]   "hideously covered with smallpox sores
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   "and just waiting for a miserable death?"
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.080]   And that happened millions of times in the history
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.320]   of the world.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.480]   Most of us in the West have been spared
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.360]   any immediate contact with the most gruesome,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   ghastly, repugnant forms of infection
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.000]   and disfigurement and writhing pain.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.480]   And I felt the force of the question,
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   "God, God, what does this mean about you?
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.180]   "What are you doing?
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.800]   "What are you saying?"
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.400]   And I'm aware from this man's question
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.960]   and from thousands of others
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.400]   that such experiences of unimaginable suffering
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.600]   and hideous disfigurement,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   that it has confirmed countless people in unbelief.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.780]   They would say, as he does, "It's impossible, Piper.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.680]   "It's just impossible to believe anymore
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.840]   "simply because of the state of the world today."
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.680]   That's his quote.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.560]   Only I'm saying the problem is worse.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   It's horribly worse because between 1900 and 1977,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.820]   300 million people died of smallpox.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.360]   Then with a massive global vaccination effort in 1977,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.000]   it was gone.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.520]   And today, nobody, think of it,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.080]   from 300 million to nobody gets smallpox.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.240]   Nobody gets polio.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.280]   The problem with suffering
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.440]   is not that the world has gotten worse.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.360]   Oh, yes, it's plenty bad.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.240]   And he documented its badness.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.400]   It's plenty bad.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.960]   But the worst problem is that for thousands of years,
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.880]   the world has had it so much worse than it is today
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.280]   in terms of horrific suffering.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   So how do I, John Piper, stay a believer
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.320]   when the little suffering that I have been exposed to
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.080]   directly and indirectly takes my breath away?
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.700]   Here's my witness.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.080]   I think I've got three thoughts here.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.880]   One, the first thing that grips me
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.240]   is the absolute realism of the Bible.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.840]   I spent several years writing a book on Providence,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.560]   and month after month, I was stunned
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   at how candid and open and blunt and even gory
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.440]   the Bible is in presenting God's judgments upon the world,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.240]   especially his own people.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.560]   Just a taste from Deuteronomy 28.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   The Lord will strike you with wasting disease
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.960]   and with fever, inflammation and fiery heat,
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.120]   and with drought and with blight and with mildew,
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.520]   and you shall be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.520]   And your dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.940]   and for the beasts of the earth.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.880]   The Lord will strike you with the boils of Egypt
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.480]   and with tumors and scabs and itch
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.880]   of which you cannot be healed.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.280]   The Lord will strike you with madness and blindness
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.840]   and confusion of mind.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.920]   Why?
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   Verses 45 following, that was verses 22 to 29, this is 45.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.600]   Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord your God,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.960]   because you did not serve the Lord your God
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.180]   with joyfulness and with gladness of heart,
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.960]   because of the abundance of all things.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.340]   Now, my point here is simply that our objections
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.600]   to God's ways are not because we have seen things
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.740]   more clearly or honestly than the Bible sees them.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.680]   The Bible doesn't shrink back from any horror
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.080]   or injustice in this world.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.920]   That's my first step.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.400]   I can't throw away the Bible because it's naive
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.920]   or deceptive or a whitewash of the miseries
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.720]   that God himself ordains.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.440]   Here's my second step.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.440]   I would say that the physical horrors in the world
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.980]   can only make sense to us and have meaning
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.780]   and eventual righteous resolution
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.020]   if we come to embrace the biblical reality
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:57.020]   that sin against an infinitely wise and just and good God
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.460]   is a moral outrage greater than the physical outrage
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.740]   of centuries of global suffering.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.760]   Let me say that again, because it is the heart of the matter
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.760]   and it is very difficult for people
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.860]   without the Holy Spirit's massive work to embrace.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.340]   I'll say it again.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.300]   The physical horrors of suffering in this world
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.420]   can only make sense to us and have meaning
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.460]   and eventual righteous resolution
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.300]   if we come to embrace the biblical reality
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.300]   that sin against an infinitely wise and just and good God
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.420]   is a moral outrage greater than the physical outrage
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.040]   of centuries of global suffering.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.260]   I'm not saying that each experience of suffering
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.500]   corresponds to each person's particular sins.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.820]   If that were true, we'd all be in hell.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.060]   As far as I can tell and as far as the Bible reveals,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.980]   there is no clear correlation
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.360]   between the extent of an individual's suffering
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.260]   in this world and the extent of their guilt.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.340]   What I'm referring to is what Paul means in Romans 8:20
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.660]   when he says, "The creation was subjected to futility,
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.780]   "not willingly, but because of him
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.800]   "who subjected it in hope," that is God.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.060]   What hope?
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.640]   "That the creation itself will be set free
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.400]   "from its bondage to corruption
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.860]   "and obtain the freedom of the glory
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.720]   "of the children of God.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.340]   "We know that the whole creation has been groaning,"
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.340]   oh, has it, "together in the pains of childbirth until now."
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.260]   It's like the earth is pregnant
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.480]   and screaming with birth pains.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.340]   "And not only the creation, but we ourselves
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.760]   "who have the first fruits of the Spirit,
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.180]   "we groan inwardly as we wait eagerly
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.640]   "for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies."
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.020]   The universal groaning of creation,
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.740]   the agonizing of all creation in suffering
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.460]   is owing to what verse 20 calls subjection,
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.360]   the creation's subjection,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.560]   and what verse 21 calls bondage to corruption.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.660]   And this subjection and corruption
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.380]   is owing to the one who subjected it in hope, namely God.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.580]   This is what I'm referring to
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.140]   when I say that the sin that came into the world
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.180]   through Adam and spread to all people
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.500]   is a moral outrage greater
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.000]   than the physical outrage of suffering,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.500]   which means that seeing and believing
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.140]   the goodness and justice of God
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.140]   assumes a Copernican revolution of our mind and heart.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.980]   In other words, if we're gonna see God as good
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.180]   and just and wise, we have to undergo
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.180]   such a profound mental and spiritual Copernican revolution
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:31.540]   of mind and heart so that God ceases to be a planet
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.740]   circling the sun of humanity
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:41.060]   and becomes the massive, blazing, glorious sun
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.020]   at the center of the solar system of all things.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.060]   God becomes supreme reality.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.580]   His being becomes the supreme worth
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.180]   and treasure of the universe.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.820]   Only in this way will the moral outrage of sin
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.820]   be seen as worse than the physical outrage of suffering,
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.780]   which means very practically
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.580]   that when I gasp at the hideous pictures
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.580]   in the documentary and find myself inevitably saying,
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.140]   "Oh God, oh God, what does this mean?"
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:29.980]   The answer I hear is all human suffering
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:35.100]   is a screaming witness to the greater horror of human sin.
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.700]   Finally, the third thing that keeps me from not believing
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:49.020]   or keeps me believing is that God sent his son
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.620]   into this world, sent his very self
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.620]   to suffer a moral outrage greater than the outrage
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:04.540]   against his father by all his people in their sin.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.420]   For the infinitely pure and good and wise
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.180]   and strong and holy son of God to descend
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.580]   to the degradation and torture of a Roman crucifixion
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.140]   is enough suffering, enough indignity
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.980]   to cover all the outrage of all the sins
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.700]   of all who believe.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.400]   Therefore, all who believe will have eternal life.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.100]   All who believe will have eternal joy.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.660]   God shows his love for us
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.660]   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.940]   So I don't claim that such faith is simple or easy.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:50.900]   It is a gift, and I am simply bearing witness
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.900]   to how it is that I am still a Christian.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.260]   - Yeah, thank you for giving hope here
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.140]   and for being willing to field these hard
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.860]   and dark emails, Pastor John.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.420]   And listeners, thank you for being willing
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.500]   to share your raw stories with us.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.900]   Our regret is that we cannot get to all of them.
